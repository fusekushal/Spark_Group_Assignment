Islam managed pretty well our arrival, even if it was last minute ;) i do recommand this place to any airbnb user :)"
1178162,4869189,2013-05-29,6452964,Charlotte,Great location for both airport and city - great amenities in the house: Plus Islam was always very helpful even though he was away
1178162,5003196,2013-06-06,6449554,Sebastian,We really enjoyed our stay at Islams house. From the outside the house didn't look so inviting but the inside was very nice! Even though Islam himself was not there everything was prepared for our arrival. The airport T Station is only a 5-10 min walk away. The only little issue was that all the people in the house had to share one bathroom. But it was not really a problem and it worked out fine. We would recommend Islams place for a stay in Boston.
1178162,5150351,2013-06-15,2215611,Marine,The room was nice and clean and so were the commodities. Very close to the airport metro station and located in quite safe area. Islam responds very quickly and is very helpful. I would recommend it.
1178162,5171140,2013-06-16,6848427,Andrew,Great location. Just 5 mins walk from the Airport Station. Good food nearby.
Room was simple,clean,"just what I was after.\"",,,
1178162,5198929,2013-06-17,6663826,Arndt,"A truely exeptional place to stay. The hosts are amazingly friendly, the rooms are spotless, and there is WiFi."
The location is superb: A Latin-American neighborhood close to the airport and just a few subway rides away from downtown. Highly recommened!,,,,,

1178162,6702817,2013-08-21,8099222,Maurice,It was a really nice time in Boston - best place to stay over in Boston !! Really nice and helpful hosts - taking there time to explain all the good things to see and how to come there.
We had a really nice time in Boston and they had a big part on that.,,,,,
If you want to go out doing sth - just ask them and they may come with you.,,,,,
Really nice and clean house - near to the airport and the subway station ( like 6 minutes away ).,,,,,
We had a really good time there and can just recommend it to anyone who want to have a comfortable and enjoyable place to stay in Boston for a good price. Thanks a lot.,,,,,

1178162,6873023,2013-08-28,7671888,Elodie,"Islam is a very nice guy ! Attentive, funny, he gave me recommandation and info about boston ( nightlife, places to go and so on)"
His flat is clean,tidy and there is a patio which is a real plus!,,,,
I DO recommand this,"great experience !\"",,,,
1178162,7646702,2013-09-28,8197342,Arkadiusz,"The place is really well furnished, pleasant and clean. Islam was very helpful, you can feel free to ask him virtually anything and he'll help you. He was fun too, very cool talking to him. Oh, and the place is pretty conveniently located too. Highly recommended."
The neighbourhood might not be the cleanest in Boston (my gf liked Brooklyne much more in that matter),"but this is a great location and price for value overall.\"",,,,
1178162,8094418,2013-10-15,9040491,Matthew,Our stay at Islam's place was fantastic. We couldn't have asked for a better value on location and amenities. We felt very much at home and comfortable at his place and would be quick to stay with him again if we return to Boston!
"Islam was always quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had and very accommodating at every point in our trip! Truly a wonderful place and a lovely host!\"",,,,,
1178162,8174594,2013-10-19,9101576,Simona,"Our stay at Islam's was very enjoyable, Islam is a very kind and responsive host."
The room was clean and comfortable and the house is provided with all comforts: full kitchen,satellite TV,comfortable living room,excellent WIFI connection in all areas.,,
"It is extremely conveniently located to downtown Boston (a few metro stops) and walking distance to the free shuttles connecting to the airport. \"",,,,,
1178162,8226316,2013-10-21,884407,Laurent,"Communication with Islam and his brother was good. However, we arrived at their house and the toilet was completely plugged up and full of excrements. At this point, we were totally disgusted. We went out to town, which by train takes about 15mn plus 10mn walk to the station. We managed to speak with Islam brother. He fixed the problem when we came back by 4pm."
The house is basic with thin walls and the bedrooms are minimum comfort. We were supposed to be on the basement,which I really don't recommend. Bad smell and the bed is for one person rather than two. We stayed in the upper room,as we though we were there. Nobody in the house except from one guest staying also in the upper level.,,,
Islam sent us an email during our stay,which we couldn't see as we didn't have a computer with us or the use of our smartphone. However,he told us to stay in the basement while no booking was made for the upper room. Not sure why he wanted us to stay in the basement where the room and bed were very basic,when he could have told us to stay in the room upstairs!,,
The fact that the owner wasn't there made it a strange feeling. The back door in the kitchen were not locked at all,while our luggage was in the house. We didn't got told at all. We had to put a bar across to kinda off close the sliding door but felt very unsafe as anybody could have walking in easily or made their way in.,,,,
All in all,things went fine by the end but we definitely not recommend the place unless the owner is there. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and don't mind of those inconvenience,then you will like it.,,,
A part from that Boston is a great city and we had fun!,,,,,

1178162,8414572,2013-10-29,478275,Kat,"Well sized room for two people with the basic necessities which also included a mini fridge. Our room, the common areas and bathrooms were clean when we arrived. There were good kitchen facilities but we did not have to use them."
"Overall good value for a location that is close enough to downtown Boston. \"",,,,,
1178162,8523707,2013-11-04,8824032,Ivan,"GREAT SPACE, PERFECT LOCATION, AWESOME PEOPLE!! Definately will be back!!!!"
1178162,11069185,2014-03-18,10454265,Jeffrey,"The room was exactly as pictured, no frills, yet adequate for my needs. The street parking was nearly impossible to find,  but you can't expect much better in Boston. I'd recommend this room to others..."
1178162,11159232,2014-03-23,9798322,Alexander,The room was clean and very comfortable. Having a key for this room also made it very safe. Getting to downtown is also very easy and fast. The whole is also very nice from the inside offering everything needed. I would definetly come back!
1178162,11420562,2014-04-01,6097987,Karthikram,Izzy was great... had clear instructions and no problems entering the house... the neighborhood wasn't great though.
1178162,11696317,2014-04-12,13599868,Paola,"The place was really good, it is like 10 minutes from the airport so it was  perfect for me because i had a connection flight, the taxi will cost u max 15 dolars and if you go by shuttle is free, the house is very clean and the room was very confortable. The only thing is that i arrive and the owner wasnt there and i didnt read the instructions where he told me how to get in the house so i was waiting for about an hour, but if you read the instructions everything will be fine."
1178162,11766427,2014-04-14,5064941,Joe,"The host wasn't there, but it was fine. He left clear instructions, and we spent 2 good nights there. It was a room was in a shared house, where there happened to be some interesting people staying, so we got to chat with some awesome people. The neighborhood is ok, had some good Colombian food."
1178162,11901870,2014-04-18,578962,Samir,Izzy was a nice and helpful host with detailed directions. The room is in the basement and even though Izzy mentions it we somehow missed that detail and it has narrow stairs leading down to it which made it hard for us to carry our bags up and down. We are unfortunately traveling with really heavy bags. The place is in East Boston and is extremely convenient for the airport.
1178162,12116711,2014-04-23,5051049,Oliver,"We arrived late from the airport, so the location was very convenient, just a 5 min walk from the airport T station. Check-in was quick and easy and the room as described. It's also very close to downtown Boston. We had a perfect stay and would definitely stay there again."
"\"",,,,,
1178162,12168229,2014-04-24,14421460,Ron,"\"Izzy was quick to reply to our request, and provided thorough instructions related to finding and entering the home. We loved the convenience of the location near the airport, as we weren't familiar with Boston, and landed late at night, so we didn't want to have to travel far or follow complicated directions to find the place. Although we never had any face-to-face contact with Izzy or anyone else in the home during our brief overnight stay, we felt comfortable there. Although we were assured that the neighborhood was safe, we were still feeling a bit on edge walking late at night from the Airport \"\"T\"\" station. Nonetheless"
1178162,12243132,2014-04-27,10018866,Crystal,Everything is exactly as posted! super convenient + easy to find.
1178162,12753057,2014-05-10,14113353,Chris,We didn´t meet Izzy at all!!!! After we arrived nobody was there except some spanish speaking people.
Our room was disgusting!!! It smelted like mold and was very dirty!!!!,,,,,
The Bathroom wasn´t cleaned either and my friend and i wanted to leave right after we came…,,,,,
The Dryer or washer was not usable because the assistant from Izzy washed all the time.,,,,,
The Neighborhood is not safe at all and every other morning u could hear people fight.,,,,,
Don´t stay there!!!!!! It´s nothing like u would expect it!,,,,,
"And it´s defenetly to expensive for this nasty place!!!! \"",,,,,
1178162,13186169,2014-05-21,14192408,Alex,I didn't get a chance to meet Izzy but I thought the system that was set up was really well done. Things went quite smoothly upon arrival as per the detailed instructions that were left.
We managed to get the key from the lock box easily which was nice because it provided flexibility for whatever time we arrived. This place is extremely close to the airport. I've never stayed next door to the airport before. Less than a 5 min ride to Airport Station which was then a 5 min walk.,,,,,
Place had everything. Felt very homely like staying at a friends. Location was amazing!! East Boston has some hidden gem restaurants and proximity to Airport subway station was key. No complaints about the room or bathroom.,,,,,
"Great setup Izzy!\"",,,,,
1178162,13514415,2014-05-29,14007556,Ósk,"Izzy's assistant was a nice and helpful person. We stayed 7 days, kitchen had everything one needs to make good food even a mixer! Our room was in the cellar and therefore very private. One fight next door where we heard screaming and shouting but overall a very calm neighbourhood and friendly people."
1178162,13586652,2014-05-31,419353,Phillip,"Host wasn't there, but instructions were clear to find and get in the place. Convenient location and a decent neighborhood (safe but a bit run-down and not much around). The room was basic but had everything I needed."
1178162,13801287,2014-06-04,1636024,Fukuko,Izzy's place was very convenient for getting to the airport. The room was cosy and clean. I was impressed with the tea selections. Izzy's friend was helpful and friendly. Definitely will come back when we have to fly out from Boston again!
1178162,14000401,2014-06-09,16307906,Amber,"Well we were kind of annoyed to be honest. We chose the most expensive room in the house because we were meant to be the only ones on the bottom floor, and we were told we would get a computer..."
Well we had his assistant sleep right outside our door and we did not have a computer.,,,,,
On top of that,every room had a TV but ours,and the tv in the living room did not get basic channels which frustrated us.,,,
The house was a mess up until the day we left,because izzy was apparently coming home that day,so his assistant decided to clean up. It was a totally different house upon checkout.,,,
His assistant was lovely,just not much help...,,,,
As far as The location goes,it is convenient to downtown and the airport,and has local shops and restaurants close by.,,,
"We did enjoy our stay overall there was just more than enough frustrating elements..\"",,,,,
1178162,14849457,2014-06-27,17001205,Sarah,"We never met our host, but they were willing to book the room with little notice.  The room was clean."
There's a little cafe a few blocks up the street that made for a perfect breakfast.,,,,,
We didn't realize that other people would be staying too,"so when they came it was a little spooky until we met them.\"",,,,
1178162,14934841,2014-06-29,16598717,New,"It was a great place to stay. Quiet, clean and close to shops, airport and public transportation.  Would recommend and stay here again."
1178162,15125674,2014-07-02,13007001,Ali,"Overall a pleasing experience.  We flew into Boston for one night to go to a concert.  Izzy left straight forward and easy to read instructions on how to reach the flat, and enter.  The room was as pictured, and exactly what we needed for the night. Izzy was readily available to us by phone or text whenever we had any questions. The flat is really close to the airport, and only a small hop into the heart of Boston, it was very convenient for us! :)"
1178162,15430473,2014-07-08,13616703,Cyril,Boston is one of the best city's I have ever been.
Issy's place is good located,and nice.,,,,
"I would recommend this place for everybody!\"",,,,,
1178162,15648106,2014-07-13,17376849,Emily,Clear directions.  Good neighborhood. Close to t station. Clean room. Quiet. Perfect!
1178162,15728913,2014-07-14,11524242,Mika,The host actually gave us a place to sleep. It is really simple. Very close to subway was perfect. There have several problems the host needs to improve.
1178162,15846810,2014-07-16,17826223,Raija,"OK stay.  Perhaps best for those on the young/adventurous side of the spectrum!  There was a sign that said 'in the process of renovations'.   I think the second floor might be a little noisy some evenings, with 3 rooms up there. The one lower/ground floor room was quieter, but keep in mind not easily accessible with narrow winding stairs. Futon style bed.     The host was prompt with text message responses to questions about parking.  Parking in the neighborhood mid-day was easy but all streets were filled with parked/double parked cars by 5pm.  It was a fairly short walk to the Blue line train line - Airport station."
1178162,15895093,2014-07-17,18020631,Lucas,"Izzy was very helpful with directions and he was easy to get in touch with, as I had some questions.  This is a great location that is a short walk to the airport shuttle.  The room is in the basement and it gets hot during the day.  The house has A/C upstairs, but this does not reach the basement room so it was pretty hot.  The neighborhood a little bit ethnic, which I didn't mind, but if this makes you uncomfortable you might want to look elsewhere.  I felt safe, and the lockbox system is secure."
For a traveler like myself who had an early flight out of Logan,"this was the cost effective option.  Can't beat the price for a location so close to the airport!\"",,,,
1178162,15982012,2014-07-19,7543714,Anne-Marie,This was ok it was easy with clear information on how getting in the house and it was very safe. The host wasn't there during the stay. The neighborhood is not so nice to hang out at night.
1178162,16035159,2014-07-20,17287987,Shu-Ping,"Izzy was out of the town when I stayed there. The location is very close to the airport, and the neighborhood is quiet and friendly.  I enjoyed my stay there and made a reservation for an additional night."
1178162,16221436,2014-07-23,2420725,Jessica,"\"Unfortunately, we can't agree with the many positive reviews. The house was easy to find and just a short 7 minute walk from the T-Station \"\"Airport\"\""
1178162,16730352,2014-08-01,7012629,Claudia,"East Boston is very nice place, well connected to the whole city and all services needed at walking distance."
The house is exactly as described,very easy to find and check in,lots of common space and nice environment. Izzy does not living in,but it's not a problem at all! He's very helpful and answered immediately to every need we had.,,
The house is clean,"not so much the room in the basement.\"",,,,
1178162,16789257,2014-08-02,17832793,Lydia,"We arrived late and left early in the morning but everything was good. Easy to find, good instructions,  comfortable bed."
1178162,17176912,2014-08-08,857238,Tim & Charlie,Izzy's room is a great value for an airport related stay. The convenience to the airport is even better than it seems in the description.
The room was clean as were sheets and towels.,,,,,
"The room could have benefitted from AC because it was August but Izzy gave us a powerful and quiet fan so we were okay.\"",,,,,
1178162,18437695,2014-08-26,2789022,Gianluca,Had a good experience overall. Short and sweet.
1178162,18561737,2014-08-28,19310647,Tamas,"It was a pleasant stay although we didn't meet personally. The room was comfortable, the metro station is close and it is really fast to get into Boston so al together we had a great time there."
1178162,18696958,2014-08-30,15346724,Stephen,Izzy's home is conveniently located for anyone visiting Boston and we were made to feel very at home. The neighborhood appears sketchy and was uncomfortable to walk through at night. Still an overall positive experience.
1178162,19087737,2014-09-06,13609481,Sarah,"Izzy's listing was as described, the room was perfect for our short stay at Boston. Although we never got to meet izzy, his brother made us feel more than welcome and helped us with anything we needed. The location was also good for us, only a few minutes from the tracks which took us straight in to Boston."
1178162,19282278,2014-09-09,20036237,Chris,"It has a quiet, convenient and safe environment.I really enjoy the stay and the talking with our host who is very nice and helpful."
1178162,19617260,2014-09-15,20104957,Nora,"We had a great Time in Boston! We really enjoyed our stay at Izzys Place. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. There is only one bathroom in the house, but some how the bath wasnt usually blocked. We never had to wait long."
You only Need About 5 Minutes to the t-station and only 3 Station to downtown,"which was very nice. We can recommend izzys Place - thank for everything. Nora & Hannah \"",,,,

A few mix ups due to my last-minute booking,but everything was made right very quickly. Great customer service. Not the fanciest place in the world,but perfect for the budget traveler.,,,

1178162,20150373,2014-09-24,20418512,Emilian,"The house was very easy to find (although it was my first time in the US and Boston) and really within walking distance of the airport. Everything was exactly as described, and we did not experience any problems during our stay (short as it was). We got a clean room with a comfortable bed, and the bathroom was also nice. If I have to stay in Boston for the night again and get back to the airport real quick, Izzy's house would be my first choice."
1178162,20239559,2014-09-26,20263502,Ilir,"I didn't meet Izzy, but his roommate was very nice and helpful."

1178162,21303347,2014-10-14,21630508,Linda,"Hard tofind parking.  One night's sleep is alright.  We didn't get to use the one only bathroom, which is shared by all.  There are 4 rooms with a total of 8 people, so it's like sharing one bathroom with 8 people."
1178162,21396968,2014-10-16,9897678,Charissa,"Izzy's place is the perfect location for those leaving to and from Logan airport, really short walking distance and a few subway stops to downtown Boston. We had a nice stay at Izzy's. The room was clean and Izzy provided a very detailed instruction of how to get to the house and everything we might need. If there's any downside I can think of is that there's only one washroom in the house and sometimes there's a wait time to use it due to the many other guests that stayed in the house. Overall, we barely have any issues and enjoyed our vacation at Izzy's place. Cheers!"
1178162,21443603,2014-10-17,22285554,Stella,"Staying at Izzy's was very convenient, especially because we had had all the information needed prior to our stay. The place was exactly as pictured. To me its location was definitely the winner, access to airport and subway was really easy. On top of that, the house was clean and well taken care of. Despite being situated in the basement, the room was also very nice and quite spacious. I liked how we had enough shelving to put our things. The only thing I wished to be different was that there was only one bathroom for all guests to share."
1178162,21721762,2014-10-22,1176690,Yanev,The room was as advertised.  It was comfortable and clean.  The system for checking in and checking out was also very convenient.

The living room, kitchen and bathroom are all clean, spacious and cozy. Izzy offered various tea bags, coffee, chocolate, fruit, bread etc. which is very nice. This place really feels like home."
Izzy's really warm and kind. He helped us carry luggage to our room and opened mistakenly closed room door early in the morning. The Italian seafood place he recommended,Rino's,is beyond delicious! We ordered some mussels and lobster ravioli. And,it's only one block away!,,
Overall,our stay in Izzy's place is lovely. It's close to transport station,which has shuttle buses that take you to the airport for only about 15 minutes and subways to the downtown area.,,,

Nevertheless,the house was clean,and the room was spacious. In addition,I think the best thing about this place is the fact that the location was really convenient,"about 6 minutes of walk along large street after getting off of the subway station (which also has free shuttles to airport). \"",
1178162,22726247,2014-11-12,14497808,Sara,"The place was perfectly located for my airport transit and so easy to get to, especially with the detailed instructions that were provided by Izzy."
The house is in cool neighbourhood and there is an excellent Mexican spot right around the corner (Angela's cafe).  All amenities I needed were provided.  The room had a controllable heater,so I could adjust the temperature myself.,,,,
Izzy is an awesome,cool host,"who takes a genuine interest in his guests. \"",,,
1178162,22787127,2014-11-14,5267228,Christopher,"I had to make a last-minute and late reservation. Izzy was great, and the room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Just what I needed."

1178162,22999630,2014-11-19,23776363,Michael,We had a good experience.  Very short in and out but it was great to be next to the airport.  Thanks
1178162,23050299,2014-11-21,22096304,Mike,"Absolutely no complaints about my stay. Very easy to access from the airport (walking) with great instructions that Izzy sent beforehand. Only met Izzy's brother. He was great, friendly and welcoming. The room had everything it needed to have. I was given a key to lock the room while I was gone during the day. Would highly recommend staying here!"
1178162,23260679,2014-11-26,19593921,Juan,"We didn't get to meet Izzy, but the room was very nice and the location was good! Would love to come back."
1178162,23315686,2014-11-28,14847580,Srinivas Spurthi,"I had to catch an early morning flight and needed a place to crash for one short night. This place was perfect as it was close to the airport (short walk to the airport shuttle stop). I did not get to meet Izzy but his brother was a good host. The room in the basement was clean, comfortable, warm and quiet. Highly recommended for convenience of airport access."
1178162,23351500,2014-11-29,14641493,Aiganym,"The room we stayed in was very clean and nicely appointed. Unfortunately I didn't meet the host, but I liked the idea of how it was managed. I would recommend to stay there and would definitely stay there the next time I'm around Boston."
1178162,23450946,2014-12-01,10350277,Pedro Jorge,It was a really good time there. The host was really friendly and helpful. Definitely a good place to stay during a trip to Boston.
1178162,23670238,2014-12-07,24350972,Kaley,The place was great! I stayed earlier in the week and returned again on my return to Boston because the people are easy going and the place is cozy and quiet for getting work done.
1178162,23853703,2014-12-12,4832845,Gg,It was perfect room for my business trip. I believe that Izzy chose that room for me as he considered the nature of my trip. It was very quiet as it was separate from other areas. I could rest well every night. The room temperature was perfect for my comfortable stay. The house was well-maintained and very clean. I strongly felt that it was a home away from home in that sense. Rosie was very nice. She baked a nice breadless cake for all of us with yogurt frosting and chocolate chips on top. I would love to stay at Izzy's again and again if I have more business trips to the area in the future. Thank you Izzy!
1178162,24089682,2014-12-19,24635135,Yun,"It's a great place to stay. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. The house is only 10-15 minutes away from the metro station. The room is spacious, clean  and comfortable. The bathroom is clean and big too. We can use kitchen freely. The whole experience is great. We will definitely stay there again next time when we visit Boston."
1178162,24442199,2014-12-28,15838913,Michelle,Room was exactly what listing posted. Had no problem finding location and host was very accommodating though we never formally met. Room even had a little heater and it was perfect for my stay. I would stay here again.
1178162,24557473,2014-12-30,22551779,Hariharan,Good private accommodation. The room was exactly as mentioned.  Would highly recommend it.
1178162,25051451,2015-01-05,24947394,Anna,"Una casa muy acogedora, muy cerca (a menos de 10 minutos andando) de la parada de metro donde se coge el bus shuttle (gratis, por cierto) que va al aeropuerto. La habitación estaba limpia, con su neverita, calentita, espaciosa y además en el piso de abajo, con lo que teníamos más intimidad."
Izzy no estaba pero nos facilitó toda la información para entrar sin problemas.,,,,,
Esos días tenía 3 habitaciones más ocupadas con otros huéspedes,así que la única pega es que como hay un solo baño,había cola para ducharse a primera hora de la mañana. Todo lo demás,"genial!\"",,
1178162,26035843,2015-02-01,26447420,Patrick,"The space was extremely comfortable and very cozy. Although I never saw Izzy during my stay there he did make me feel very welcome. It was very easy to find the place and it was also very simple to check in and get situated. Overall, it was a very nice stay and I plan on staying here whenever I come to Boston"

1178162,26173195,2015-02-05,8479064,Iyann,"I had to book a last minute stay the day before and Izzy was really nice to give me immediate and fast response. He assured me I have that room although I had technical problems with Airbnb, again. Izzy was always responsive throughout my stay, though I didn't get to see him. I went there the day after the snow storm. Arrived at South Station. (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) taught me to walk 15 mins to the blue T line. But I took the silver line and then the free airport shuttle. It was actually better option considering my heavy luggage. I arrived the day after the snow storm. The distance from the airport subway station to the apartment wasn't far, but the excessive snow made it really difficult to walk. The pathways were narrow n the steps were hard to climb with my luggage. But by evening, it was nice that the snow were shoveled from the steps. I personally like the place a lot - homey and comfy and has everything I need. It's easy and fast to get to the airport n main attractions too."
1178162,26512707,2015-02-14,21650503,Alexandra,We stayed with Izzy just for one night because it was close to Logan airport and I had a flight the next morning. He was really nice and the room was warm and comfy! Good location with parking. I would definitely recommend staying here!
1178162,26913566,2015-02-22,24332659,Erika,"Izzy is a great host. He helped us with the luggage and was ready to answer us with any questions we may have had. He was in the house the whole week and he gave us plenty of privacy. We could use for free washer and dryer and the kitchen was always available. We had some trouble finding a car park because of the snow so we had to park 10-minute walk away from our street, anyway was also nice to hang out with the other airbnb guests and share cultures :) The bathroom was always available and also you could use towels and everything was clean. We could t really go around the neighbourhood but we were close to a cvs pharmacy, a grocery shop and the blue line station (airport stop)."
"I would definitely stay there again!!!\"",,,,,
1178162,27367271,2015-03-02,17005346,Anthony,"Nice place, great location! Neighborhood is great, many local restaurants, cafés, etc. Close to downtown, 5-10 mins. Izzy has been a great host; welcoming and present to help his guests! We had an amazing time!"
1178162,27421477,2015-03-03,28563664,Doug,"The place was right on, no surprises. Izzy was a nice guy, pretty laid back. The house was close to the subway, but the 5 blocks between the two would be a little unnerving to walk at night."
1178162,27724234,2015-03-10,8111051,Greg,Izzy was a gracious and generous host.  He was flexible with check-in and accommodating with all facets of our stay.  He even was able to help some other travelers who'd had a bad experience with another AirBNB host.  solid guy.
One detail to be aware of - there is only one bathroom shared amongst numerous guests.  If you're ok with a little bathroom sharing and potentially waiting in line,this is a perfectly fine place to stay.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1178162,27820897,2015-03-12,12823489,Jan,"Although we planned this trip to Boston quite spontaneous, we did not have any issues with finding an accommodation at Iyyz Jm's place. The direction from the public transportation were very straight forward and explained everything very well. Once we arrived at the place, we fount very clean, well-decorated, and welcoming rooms. A personal welcome note further helped us considering this place as our new home for two days. We shared the entire house with two other airbnb'ers, which were really nice and polite as well. Overall, I'm very happy I've fount this place and can certainly recommend it to everyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune for the hotels downtown!"
1178162,28194318,2015-03-19,13534991,Pragya,"It was a great location, very close to the airport and easy to find. The apartment was well-furnished. The room was clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was shared with other guests. Excellent stay! Highly recommend this listing!"
1178162,28275938,2015-03-21,28940110,Sophie,"I did a self check-in which went very smoothly as Izzy's detailed directions were very easy to follow. The house was very close to Airport Station, and the neighborhood was fine. Kitchen and livingroom were beautiful, my room in the basement was simple, clean, and comfortable. There was even a small space heater to keep me warm during the night. Everything was well-organized and welcoming. The other guests were very nice as well. I would definitely stay here again!"
1178162,28832314,2015-03-30,29541165,Emily,Everything was great--izzy was very detailed in his instructions and it was an easy stay!
1178162,28918872,2015-03-31,16005330,Michael,"\"The place was as advertized - a private room, great price, close to the airport, etc. And while I am reluctant to give negative feedback I felt that Izzi is running an operation here that is not consistent with my values, and what I believe are the implicit values of the AirBnB \"\"community.\"\""
The host actually does not live in the place,"rather he lives out of state and has some caretaker changing the sheets and keeping the place clean. So in essence the place is a low security hotel or hostel - except with no management present to deal with any contingencies that might come up between guests. Given that there is shared intimate space the proprietor is relying on the generally good character of the \"\"AirBnB Community\"\" to make sure that nothing untoward occurs. Chances are that nothing untoward will occur",but it is an exposure.,,,
What I also feel is happening in this sort of operation is that it is a business being run in a residential area - compromising the coherency of the neighborhood and riding on the infrastructure of legitimate hotels  (who pay hotel taxes,liability insurance,employment taxes,and other commercial fees) while not paying for the infrastructure that these taxes and fees pay for.,,
This is America,where entrepreneurial enterprise is rewarded. But this is also America where this can mean concentrating enterprise efforts on profit centers,and externalizing cost centers. The impacts of that externalization do not decrease the costs,"they just end up in someone else in-basket.  My sense of conviviality eschews externalizing costs to the expense of the neighborhood or local businesses.\"",,
1178162,29075057,2015-04-03,4136165,Andrew,The space is nice enough and it's *great* value. I wouldn't say that the way that the host welcomed me was especially warm and friendly -- there was a form message that instructed me on how to get into the apartment. I think the message could be more personalized.
1178162,29113877,2015-04-04,28415206,Daníel,"It was very nice, everything was fine and comfy, even though the host didnt stay at all in the house (no big deal)"
1178162,29343569,2015-04-06,25521189,Jeannette,"Great location for the airport - however we couldn't go through the park as the gate was locked, which made getting to the airport for our early morning flight a little stressful. Otherwise - great room, great location and great price!"
1178162,29713671,2015-04-11,30822621,Jordan,"Close to the airport, affordable, hardly knew i was in someones house it was so quiet. Can't really ask for more for your stopover in Boston. Make sure you leave with plenty of time to go North of the East Boston Memorial Park if your flight is in the early morning as the gates will be chained. Going up the greenbelt trail i was able to make it to the T station in plenty of time."
1178162,29773639,2015-04-12,10822797,Jessica,"\"Izzy's place was extremely convenient fir us since it's so clise to the airport and just twi subway stops away from downtown. we loved to see the \"\"real\"\" Boston in a cool"
1178162,30113234,2015-04-17,1277291,Albert,Izzy's communication is very good. All communication was done via text or AirBnB messaging. Directions and house details were well spelled out & clear. I was in the basement room of the 3 rooms he rents out. Everything is clean but spares. I would not consider it cozy but it was a very good value.
1178162,30375840,2015-04-21,17044595,Carolyn,"I did not see Izzy during my stay, but the check-in instructions delivered by email were very clear. The home is run much like a hostel - I was welcomed by a white-board on the door of my room.  Everyone else staying in the house was very nice and helped me feel at home. There are shared tea/coffee supplies, slippers, and a space heater for my room, all of which were nice touches! The neighborhood is Mexican-American, with many ethnic food choices. There was no great place for groceries or coffee, but Santarpio's pizza is the best in Boston and is within walking distance of the house (cash only - worth every penny!) The Government Center Station on the T is closed until 2016, which means you have to make at least 2 transfers to get anywhere downtown or in Back Bay.  Had I realized this before my stay, I would have probably stayed downtown. Taxi drivers grumbled about driving to East Boston because of the tolls and my Taxi/Uber fares for 2 days cost nearly $100."
1178162,30898031,2015-04-28,26854344,Marwa,"Our stay was quite good at Izzy's place. Getting in touch with him was easy, he is very reachable and answers quickly to all the questions. We arrived really early in the morning but we managed to put our stuff in the house before the check-in. The location is perfect for people travelling from the airport - it's a 7 minutes walk to the subway station and a 10 min subway ride to downtown which is fine."
The only problem with the house is that there is only one bathroom for 4 rooms,so it's kind of bothering when everyone wants to shower in the morning.,,,,
And -1 for the cleaning and the garbage that was not changed in the room after the ones that were there before us!,,,,,
But overall it's a good price/value room,"specially that it's in the basement so far from the other rooms.\"",,,,
1178162,31065702,2015-05-01,31210198,Imed,I checked in at midnight. & left at. 9:00 am. The room & bathroom were very clean & quiet. Highly recommend it.
1178162,31615118,2015-05-07,32304618,Omkar,The place is very close to the Airport T Station. So very convenient to travel around Boston. The listing was as described for the most part. I had the room in the basement. The bathroom was clean and so was the kitchen.
"I met Izzy on the second and he was very welcoming. Overall I was pleased with the place\"",,,,,
1178162,31749924,2015-05-09,31666495,Lissy,"I enjoyed my stay at Izzy's place. He gave me very detailed directions, so finding his place was a breeze. My room was in the basement which made it feel more private. The room had a fridge, mirror, towels, hangers and even slippers. Sharing a bathroom was a little tricky, but no one ever took too long.  The bathroom did need a bit of cleaning, especially the bathtub. Getting to and from downtown Boston was relatively easy once you get the hang of the subway system. The neighborhood was nice, we saw parents walking their kids to school in the morning and I felt safe walking late at night. Overall this is a great value. I would stay here if I'm ever in Boston again."
1178162,32081121,2015-05-13,28593986,King Hin,"Izzy is very friendly and he provided assistance when I was there ,which made us feel like living in our own home."
The room is clean and tidy. It was also convenient to go to downtown since it is close to the airport station,"which take only a few stops to go downtown.\"",,,,
1178162,32137028,2015-05-14,32352732,Xiaoxi,"I booked this room for my mom and her friends, it the room downstair, Izzy write my name on the board in front of the door and makes me feel welcome. My mom and her friends said they like the room so i give 5 stars for it."
1178162,32542159,2015-05-19,1096354,Sarah,The ''self'' check-in was really easy.
The fact that there is just one bathroom for all the guests is not optimal but we manage to make it work.,,,,,
Great location,"really close to a subway station and it's easy to get to Downtown Boston.\"",,,,
1178162,33255901,2015-05-26,15971951,Kenzie,We had a great stay at Izzy's place. The space was as described and in a super convenient location. There are lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance and is a short walk to airport station. We would definitely return!
1178162,33478897,2015-05-28,32584563,Erik,"I had an excellent experience at Izzi's place. It was my first Airbnb experience and he took time to explain everything before my arrival. When I arrived, he was very welcoming and easy to talk to. I also got along very well with his house manager, Victoria. They're both awesome people. The room was clean and welcoming. I liked being able to use the fridge and oven and just hang out in the living room. The location was ideal since it was within easy walking distance of the tram and airport, plus there are several good restaurants within a few blocks. I will definitely stay here again when I'm in Boston again."
1178162,33742100,2015-05-31,20587543,Sonya,"Izzy responded to all messages quickly before the stay. He gave clear directions to property and how to get in. He offered me a place to leave my bag early in the day before check-in. The room was clean and comfortable with a fridge and fan. He was very friendly and offered me suggestions about where to go to dinner and when to leave for my early morning flight. There were many other guests in home and common area but all were polite and quiet. Overall, excellent stay and great value for the area."

Very comprehensive instructions on how to get to his place from the airport; we arrived early, meaning to put our luggage in the hall but our room was already ready!

But this is not a negative point. If you read Izzy's description completely he mentions this. The house is more like a small hostel with lots of travellers than a private room. Unfortunately there is only one bathroom (one shower) which sometimes causes in problems at the morning. Our room and bathroom were clean. The location is a good point to explore the city and is not far away from the airport. Metro is 5 min away by foot. There are also some supermarkets and other shops not far away.\""

1178162,38759858,2015-07-18,2412576,Isabelle,"Izzy was friendly. The house was fine.  The instructions were good.  I liked the ethnically diverse neighborhood, especially the Brazillian restaurant, Oliverias, and the Italian Place, Rino's.  There is also an amazing Candlepin Bowling (the original bowling with small wooden balls) Alley, called Central Park Lanes right down the street.  The house was fine, clean and well stocked.  We were in the basement which was comfortable, well furnished and clean.  I wish I had known I was going to get the basement room. I probably wouldn't have stayed there.  It was a little stuffy and the stairs down felt really narrow.  Luckily we were able to open the windows.  Cold air drops so it was also nice and cool in the basement.

The instructions provided were very clear and we had no trouble finding the place and the room. There are several rooms in the house which was actually more like a small youth hostel. There were other guests present using the shared facilities (kitchen/bath room/living room), however it was no issue. Sometimes there may be a waiting time for the bath room as there is only one. For us it provided what we were looking for: a place (VERY!) close to the airport to spend one night. The neighbourhood is not the most affluent one but we didn't feel unsafe at any time (weren't out at night though)."
1178162,40097737,2015-07-28,15351471,Dan,"Overall, we were not too impressed with our stay. This is mainly due to a lack of communication between the host and us. We arrived after a very long journey, with no idea where we should go or how to proceed. We stumbled upon our room but never given our own key for our whole stay. The bathroom was inconveniently placed on a different floor to us and was shared with approx. 3 other guests, making for plenty of waiting time. The location is conveniently near the logan airport station and our room was in fact very nice and spacious making for a comfortable stay but it would have been a lot better if the host was actually there to help out."
1178162,40348222,2015-07-30,35788297,Gabriel,Nous avons bien aimer notre séjour en général! Boston est une super belle ville et l'emplacement du airbnb était parfait! Malheureusement Izzy n'a pas été présent à notre arrivée. Nous l'avons pas vu du tout pendant nos deux jours.
La chambre était généralement assez propre mais nous avons du changer les draps... Je vous conseil d'apporter vos propre draps et oreillers.,,,,,
"Aucun problème aussi avec les autres airbnbers.\"",,,,,
1178162,40649742,2015-08-01,24819485,Allyson,Izzy was really helpful. He was constantly suggesting things to do and the best way to get from point A to point B. He was friendly and well informed. The room was clean and we enjoyed our stay very much!

La chambre était propre,de même que les espaces communs.,,,,
Très bon accueil,instructions très claires pour accéder à la maison et à la chambre.,,,,
Ambiance sympathique avec les autres locataires Airbnb.,,,,,
Localisation proche du Métro Airport,pratique pour rejoindre le centre,et pour y accéder depuis l'aéroport avec la navette bleue (1 station).,,,

1178162,42887293,2015-08-16,11304186,Oihane,Everything was as we expected. The bedroom was as the description says and even the bathroom was shared with the other guest it was clean. Also we had a very nice evening with Izzy and his friends.
1178162,43490523,2015-08-20,27488796,John,"Did not meet Izzy, but his assistant was in the house when we arrived."
Izzy's instructions from Logan Airport to the house were spot on as were the instructions for entry. The room was just as advertised. No air con,but large room fan supplied and was ok. The remainder of the house had air con. Kitchen facilities very good,plenty space and hot water. No problems with the neighbour hood. We did plenty walking and sampled a couple of cafes and a restaurant which were great. Food mostly south and meso American.,,,

1178162,45118236,2015-08-31,24129912,Tina,"I never met Izzy. Instructions to get into the place were clear. It just took us a few minutes inside to figure out which was our room. It is set up a bit like a hostel, with 4 guest rooms in 1 house. The location was fantastic, within walking distance of the airport. The room was fine, though in a basement and a little humid. The house is in ok condition, with fairly old fixtures but clean."
1178162,45739543,2015-09-05,38540913,Yixiang,The house locates near the airport subway station and there is a small mart nearby. Fabiana is a friendly girl to help us get used to this house. The other roommates are friendly as well.
1178162,46121460,2015-09-08,33814203,Marie-Sophie,"Izzy aime les gens et ça transparaît. Il est très accueillant et donne de très bonnes indications des endroits à visiter à Boston. Comme la station de métro Airport est située à cinq minutes du logement, nous avons pu laisser notre voiture stationnée toute la fin de semaine. C'est vrai, il y a beaucoup de voyageurs chez Izzy, mais la plupart save se comporter en société. Seul bémol, il n'y a qu'une salle de bain pour quatre chambres, ça peut créer des bouchons à certains moments dans la journée."
1178162,46536780,2015-09-11,42838376,Elle Gemma,"This place was great. Clean, perfect location, cute neighborhood, and friendly host. Izzy was kind enough to chat with us when we arrived, provide recommendations for late night bars and food in the area, teach us about the transportation system and even give us beers after a stressful travel experience. Would definitely stay here again."
1178162,47486681,2015-09-19,12099974,Sandy,The host is very organized and helpful. It is a pleasant place to stay. Wish we could stay for more days. Maybe next time. :)
1178162,48282056,2015-09-25,16342545,Stephanie,We stayed for one night in Izzy's house. The room was clean and had everything we needed. Izzy and his father were friendly hosts. We enjoyed talking to them.
The house is located in a nice neighbourhood and very close to the Airport and the city of Boston.,,,,,

1178162,49483627,2015-10-04,42941326,Ross,"Everything was as mentioned. The host was very friendly. The house is in a really great neighborhood, some of the best mexican food aboit 2 blocks away. The bed was a futon, not the most uncomfortable but still not a bed if that is what you require.  Had a great time!"
1178162,49986971,2015-10-08,41622354,Malcolm,Great location with good amenities. Izzy was helpful and informative. The house is more like a hostel but perfect for a couple days stay in Boston.
1178162,50146105,2015-10-09,41846102,Raphael,"The house is near the airport and the neighbourhood is a nice area with many (but expensive) cornershops. The check-in procedure was conveniant and the room and the house is well equipped. If  you want to get downtown, you can get a free ride with the silver line from the airport, which inbound-service is always for free. We had a pleasant stay!"
1178162,50696273,2015-10-13,6622276,Sarah,Everything was easy and as described. Perfect location for an early morning flight out of Logan.

1178162,52068762,2015-10-26,43108005,Radhika,"I don't think it was a good experience. The room was in the basement, while the bathroom was on the ground floor. The heater in the room was not functioning well. Don't think it was worth the money."
1178162,52616773,2015-10-31,39161770,Eric,"Great spot for proximity to airport!  If headed to room from downtown on subway, be sure to walk over bridge to other side of tracks while still in the station!  Dont walk out of the wrong exit out of station!  Cause they you will have a long walk!  But if you walk over bridge and take the right exit you are a short walk.  Free shuttle from subway station makes this great for catching early morning flights.  Seems like a high volume rate of guests here so definitely has a hostel feel.  Great for leisure travrlers."
1178162,53220248,2015-11-06,19982491,Melina,"It was a great experience! The apartment is very well placed, close to the airport, 10 minutes walking. It was absolutely clean! I didn't meet Izzy, but was very welcomed by a guy who works with him. The room is placed in the basement and there are a toilet and a bathroom sink. There is no other placed to stay. This private room is the best option in Boston."

The directions to get into the place were very clear and easy to follow. The location was right by the airport station on the blue line of T, a six minute walk total. The room was clean and the house was inviting. Great stay!"

It was also pretty convenient to get from place to place as the train station is just a few blocks away. Although I didn't get to meet Izzy, from the conversation we had through messages, he was very understanding and nice. Our housemates are kind too. Overall, my friend and I did have a good experience in Boston. Thank you for letting us stay, Izzy!"
1178162,58713980,2016-01-03,5967817,Peter,Was able to score this place at the last minute. Very easy peasy to access to this place from Logan Airport. She left detailed instructions on how to find/access to this house.
What's even better is that I was allowed to leave my bag here after checking out so I could check out Boston before departing. That's an A plus in my book.,,,,,

1178162,62197610,2016-02-12,19533158,Sarah,"The only thing I messed up was not looking at the page of information after we booked. All the information you need to check in and get settled into your room was all there. I did call Izzy and he responded promptly through phone or text. The room was secluded and the place was quiet. I recommend Rino's restaurant, which is like 5 minutes from Izzy's!! Definitely recommend staying here."

1178162,62846956,2016-02-17,57075507,Shambhavi,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was amazing! We had the room in the basement which was very private, clean, and warm on one of the coldest days in Boston. There was a space heater we could use which helped, on the day it was -30 degrees Celsius outside. There were also clean extra blankets, lots of pillows and the bed was very comfortable and clean as well. The host also provided us with clean towels, and we were able to lock our door for privacy. The lady we talked with was also very kind and friendly. The location is also very close to the airport subway station, which makes it easy to get around. I would definitely stay here again thank you so much for your hospitality!"
1178162,63502903,2016-02-23,49428419,Amy,"Izzy's home is really well located in a nice neighbourhood with easy access to the airport and downtown Boston. However we found it a bit strange that we didn't meet Izzy once - we like to choose our hosts based on their personal profile as well as the room listing so this was a bit disappointing. The lady who was there was very sweet and showed us where everything was but we didn't really click so we didn't spend much time at all in the communal areas. The room is spacious with plenty of natural light and was fairly clean, however there was a really loud vent that came on and off all the time, I'm not a particularly light sleeper but it often woke me and there were no ear plugs provided or option to turn it off as it heats the whole house. Overall we had a fine stay, it was a lot more like a bnb (without the breakfast) or a hostel than a home, but it was all ran professionally and other than the noise we had no real problems."
1178162,63845448,2016-02-27,306481,Matthew,"Pleasant one night stay at Izzy's home. The bed was comfortable, the room (and house overall) was very clean, and directions for check-in were clear. Amazing value!"

Just minutes from the airport in a quiet, working class neighborhood dotted with great restaurants and markets. Our basement room was clean and quiet. The house was full but all the other guests were polite and friendly. The common areas were clean and inviting. Izzy provides quick and simple self check-in and check-out instructions. We walked to a great restaurant, Rino's, from Izzy's place. Great home base in Boston!"

1178162,76676154,2016-05-28,67050649,Kristina,Great place to stay near the airport and easy to get downtown. The self check-in was perfect for us so we didn't have to disturb anyone getting in from a late flight. Izzy was great at responding to all of our questions and making the reservation for us.
1178162,77616640,2016-06-02,66816280,Patrick,"Izzy wrote a welcoming message on the door of our room.  There are two other renters and it was enjoyable meeting and talking with them.   We never met or spoke with Izzy but talked with a women who tried her best to assist us but could not.  The room was fine but the experience was negatively affected by the difficult parking.  Most streets are two hours only unless you have a sticker.  We spent too much time trying to find nearby overnight parking and there was none. After much frustration, we finally located parking about 1/2 mile away.  We had use of the kitchen for breakfast, but the pots and pans for cooking were not as good as we might have liked.  In summary, the room was fine but the parking and kitchen made this a negative experience."

1178162,81721003,2016-06-24,6209791,Rebecca,I was happy to find a sort of communal hostel upon my return from nine months of backpacking thru South America. There was no way I was going to stay in some awful franchise but I wanted something near the airport for a late night arrival after long international flights. I was very happy with my stay - the room was comfortable and the shared facilities were well organized and welcoming. Because I was jet lagged I went straight to bed but would have otherwise been interested in spending time with the other travelers staying here. Additionally there were a number of Salvadoran restaurants that looked  great - cheap and cheerful - so you can have tasty ethnic food just minutes from the door. The neighborhood is safe and friendly - it's a low income Hispanic residential section of town - and I enjoyed walking around smiling and waving to the locals sitting on their stoops.
1178162,82732149,2016-06-29,19338623,Kate,"I spent three nights here and enjoyed my stay. I never saw the host, and there were other guests staying at the house. I don't think anyone actually lives here and the house is used for air bnb, but I'm not entirely sure. The location is super convenient to the airport and to the T that gives you access to the City of Boston. Family neighbourhood that was very quiet. The bed is super comfortable and the interent was great.  Izzy also kindly let me store luggage in the house during the day before my early evening flight."
1178162,84287344,2016-07-06,55352755,Theresa,"I was very thankful to find this place.  I was stranded over night in Boston, and this place was available and within walking distance of the airport (after the free shuttle ride to the train station)."
I never saw Izzy or anyone else. It's a little pricey for the quality,and smells like animal in one area,but it was exactly what I needed,"when and where I needed it! \"",,
1178162,85895012,2016-07-13,55990155,Carolyn,"The house was easy to find from the airport train staton, just a quick walk through the park. On our first night we met friends for dinner and after dropping off our things, I noticed a sign on the park gates saying 'closed at 11 pm'. We had a bit of a rush to make it back in time and got off the T at 10.56! I am not sure how observant they are of the park closing times, but it's something to keep in mind. The basement room was clean, comfortable and private, which I appreciated. Having one bathroom for a house with 4 bedrooms meant that there was often a wait for the shower/ toilet, but we managed. There were plenty of Boston brochures and maps about the house for guests to use, which was handy, great to help us decide how to use our three days in town. The house was clean and welcoming, with the hand towel and bath mat seemingly changed daily. The shower did need a bit of a clean though the rest of the bathroom as spotless. we could have done with a towel rail or some kind of hooks on which to hang our towels in our room. Otherwise despite the heat, they could be slow to dry. We loved the fact it wa just 3 stops from the action, so getting in in the morning and home at night was such a simple and quick process. Very happy withour stay."

The instructions to get to the house from the airport were also very helpful and easy to follow. Izzy was very helpful with suggestions for things to do in Boston. We had the opportunity to interact not only with him but with his assistant Fabi and other gusts as well. Everyone was very nice and polite. If you're looking for a clean and affordable place to stay in Boston, Izzy 's place is definitely a good option."
1178162,92753889,2016-08-09,8388938,Isaac,"Me and my wife rented this room for 1 night.Location was good, near to the airport. The room and common spaces were clean. I highly recommend."
1178162,93633143,2016-08-13,54400090,Matthew,"Property was easy to find, extremely clean, very safe, and convenient to the airport and rental car areas.  Much easier than staying at a hotel nearby for more money.  Izzy was very easy to reach and a great host!"
1178162,94675484,2016-08-16,17356185,Giulia,nothing what I expected !
we start from the position..the house is in a very bad boston district where there is nothing and there live exclusively Latinos (hispanic district) ! the metro is a 10 min walk but if you come back late at night you have to go for strength to a park where there are not recommended subjects . we had always come back soon because we were afraid something happened to us ! neighborhood dirty,ugly people,no restaurant !,,,
as it regards the room was in the basement ... with a small WC designed in under 1 meter scale .,,,,,
all very dirty and very poorly maintained.,,,,,
nobody helped us by giving us indications,,,,,
"terrible experience .\"",,,,,
1178162,95628487,2016-08-20,52195225,Shijing,"The house uses a self check-in way, the guest can follow the instruction  the host sends before arrival, it was easy and simple. The place is very clean, and we saw a shelf with all those clean towels. we stayed at the first floor, but since one has to go upstairs to get into the house, you have to go downstairs to get into this bedroom. But there are windows and light can get into the bedroom."
The owner was not in the house,but there are stickers with instructions on them all over the house,so it was very convenient. The owner's friend also lives in that house,"so she can help guests with what they need.\"",,
7246272,49011639,2015-09-30,41266959,Juliano,My wife and I had a great experience while staying with Alex and Bob. The house is very organized and the room was great. Everything was very clean and the decoration was very beautiful.
The neighborhood is nice and the house is near restaurants,pubs and markets where you can purchase whatever you need. The T is not far: about 15 minutes walking.,,,,
The hosts were caring and were always thinking about our necessities and about how they could make us comfortable.,,,,,
Alex and Bob are both great guys and our stay couldn't have been better!! Alex was our host during our stay. He's an amazing human being and was always there for us.,,,,,
Thank you so much,guys.,,,,
"I hope we can see you again soon.\"",,,,,
7246272,49287275,2015-10-02,8942041,Hannah,Had a great time at Robert and Alex's place. The room is stylish and comfortable and the gardens are beautiful! Not far from the T. I enjoyed my stay and hanging out with Alex!
7246272,50085405,2015-10-09,30324147,Leith,We were welcomed by Rob on early arrival and he very helpfully allowed us to leave our luggage until check in time. This was much appreciated.
The room and facilities were excellent and were as they appeared on their website.  There is plenty of storage and hanging space,and the extra jets in the shower were very soothing after hard days walking!,,,,
We were able to use the kitchen facilities for breakfast and our evening meal and we also used their washing machine and dryer.,,,,,
The 12 minute walk to the train station was fine in the day - we didn't come home after dark so can't make a comment on that. The location was not quite as we'd expected .,,,,,
"There weren't many restaurants in close proximity although there were a couple of convenience stores close by.  \"",,,,,
7246272,50367275,2015-10-11,45325384,Warren,"It was a first AirBnB experience for my girlfriend and I and honestly, we did not expect such a nice stay. Alex was a wonderful host and such a nice person! The room was perfectly clean with an AMAZING private bathroom.  The neighbourhood was nice and the train was not far from the condo (10 min walk). There are also other little surprises that made our stay very pleasant but enough spoilers! We highly recommend this bedroom rental."
7246272,50468704,2015-10-12,41772558,Benjamin,Had a great experience!! Alex was a great host!! The premise was amazing and had a beautiful garden display!! We would not hesitate to stay again!! Thank you!!
7246272,50926970,2015-10-16,19684942,Guy & Jeanette,Alex and Bob's flat is decorated with attention to detail. Alex was a great host. We loved his messages.
7246272,51131704,2015-10-18,42146325,Rob,"The place was wonderful - we had a beautifully-decorated & impeccably-kept private room, with a new-looking full bath, comfortable queen bed & full closet. Alex made sure he was there to greet us, & went out of his way to make us feel comfortable & welcome, with pre-printed maps to a great, walkable restaurant & the T stop - we used the T frequently to go all over Boston. He & Robert had snacks set out for us, & clearly take great pride in the condition & tasteful decorating of our room & the whole condo/townhouse."
My wife & I DEFINITELY recommend this place,"& would ABSOLUTELY stay there again on our next trip to Boston!\"",,,,
7246272,51926291,2015-10-25,3791315,Héctor,"We stayed two nights with Bob and Alex and it could not have been better. They received us on Friday evening with a really beautiful home and a welcoming message posted on the fridge! :) Everything was perfectly arranged and every detail was taken care of. The bedroom and the house were really comfortable (we fall in love with the mattress!). The description is really accurate, everything is more than clean and it makes you feel at home. We will definitely be back. Totally recommended."
7246272,52191067,2015-10-26,28233388,Rebecca,"Alex was extremely helpful and accommodating. He gave us a map of the area, gave us suggestions for places to go out/restaurants, and even provided us with a Charlie card (to use for public transit)!"
The listing is just like the pictures: extremely clean,lovely,and pleasant all-around. Essentially,Alex keeps a nice home.,,
"I'd read online that Dorchester is a \"\"rougher\"\" part of Boston",so I asked Alex about this. He reassured me that as long as we stay on big streets,"we'd be fine; I didn't at any point feel insecure in my safety. The neighborhood's cute and within walking distance of various restaurants. \"",,,
7246272,53378365,2015-11-08,6919142,Pam,The room was nicely decorated and the bed very comfortable. We liked the walk-in closet and the huge bathroom.

7246272,54527932,2015-11-21,47930937,Yoshi,"They are the nicest people I have ever met. We landed to Boston at around 1 am and then took uber to get to their place, but we told the driver wrong address, and we did not get to their place until like 3 am. But Alex was up and waiting for us to welcome. Room was simply amazing. No doubt  to give them five stars."
7246272,54617219,2015-11-22,33235010,Will,This is a great room with everything you need and more. The en suite bathroom is the best I've seen at an Airbnb. Would highly recommend.
7246272,55756413,2015-12-05,34366060,Markus,Amazing home. Best place I have ever stayed Alex and Bob are amazing people  who are very kind and respectful  towards there guest. The home is in a great location  to get anywhere in the city fast. Did I mention it's gorgeous.
7246272,60964846,2016-01-30,43666053,Roman,"Great place. Kind hosts. You've got your own entrance to your room and Alex (the host) respects your privacy, but if you want to go to the living room and interact with him, you'll find a kind guy to talk to."
The place is very clean,"I mean very very clean. I had a lovely time staying there.\"",,,,

Me and my girlfriend returned from a 3 days stay at Alex and Bob. We were warmly welcomed by Alex who was able to properly advise us throughout our stay. The condo is beautiful and the room we occupied for three nights was very cozy. The bed is extremely comfortable and the ensuite bathroom includes a huge shower which is perfect after a tiring day of walking and visiting. The red line (Boston Subway) passes near the condo,which makes it easier to visit and travel from one part of the city to another.,,,,
We had a small problem with our bikes rental with Hubway (the bike sharing system in Boston),but fortunately,Bob and Alex were kind enough to offer us their help and called the Hubway company,which helped a lot and saved us from wasting time making calls.,,
We are more than satisfied with our stay and recommend this Airbnb without any hesitation. We hope to return at Alex and Bob in the future. Thanks again guys and take care!,,,,,

Moi et ma copine revenons d’un séjour de trois jours à Boston où nous avons eu la chance de rester dans le Airbnb de Alex et Bob. Nous avons été accueillis chaleureusement par Alex qui a d’ailleurs su bien nous conseiller tout au long de notre séjour. Le condo est absolument magnifique et la chambre que nous avons occupée était chaleureuse et douillette. Le lit est extrêmement confortable et la salle de bain attenante comprend une immense douche,ce qui a été particulièrement apprécié après nos journées à visiter et à se promener dans la ville. Le métro (red line) passe à proximité de la résidence,ce qui facilite grandement les déplacements vers le centre-ville et les autres secteurs de Boston.,,,
Nous avons eu un petit problème lors de la location de nos vélos avec la compagnie Hubway,mais heureusement,Alex et Bob ont eu la gentillesse de nous proposer leur aide. Ils ont appelé la compagnie,ce qui nous a évité de perdre du temps à faire des démarches par téléphone.,,
"Nous sommes plus que satisfaits de notre séjour et nous recommandons cet Airbnb sans aucune hésitation. Nous comptons retourner chez Alex et Bob lors de notre prochaine visite à Boston. Merci pour tout et au plaisir! :)\"",,,,,
7246272,66489701,2016-03-22,1569241,Rhonda,"Alex and Bob were absolutely awesome! From the very first contact with them, until the day I left, they made me feel that they cared about making my trip great. Both Alex and Bob where readily available through texting and calls if I needed them. Bob also texted me or called me several times during my trip to make sure that I was doing okay. I was a single, female, traveler in a big city, so I really appreciated him checking on me and making sure I was doing alright. Alex often asked me if I needed anything or if there was anything that needed refreshing in my room. The two of them anticipated the needs of a traveler and the room was set up great. The room was very clean and comfortable. Coffee readily available in the morning very important for this Traveler! They were also great in helping me know what the city had to offer and all the cool places to visit. They had maps printed out and available for local restaurants that are within walking distance as well as directions to the nearest T Station. I can't say enough about these two hosts. They made my stay even better than I anticipated and when I come back to Boston, if they are available, I will definitely book with them again. I highly recommend their place!"
7246272,70658731,2016-04-19,50865218,Alena,"My wife and I could not have asked for a better experience than we had with Alex (and Bob), both were outstandingly accommodating and made us feel as if we were at home. Every morning Alex had breakfast items laid out for us and coffee ready to brew, along with delicious fresh baked coconut chocolate cookies and banana bread brownies. The room we stayed in was perfectly kept, all our amenities were provided, and the shower is just something you will have to see for yourself! Alex was very personable (and so was Bob) to talk top and we enjoyed all our conversations, and he even gave us some great pointers on improving our green thumb (he is an exceptional gardener). If you want to give the non-traditional tourist trip to Boston, then Alex and Bob are the perfect people to get you started; from restaurant recommendations and attractions to understanding the public transportation and local history, they make sure you are taken care of every step of the way. If we ever come back to Boston, we know where we'd want to stay."
7246272,71114337,2016-04-23,66258599,Connor,"Alex was very nice and made us feel right at home!! Even though we only stayed a night, it was a very nice experience!"
7246272,71292647,2016-04-24,40807976,Katie,"We were very fortunate to find Alex and Bobs home! It was the perfect spot, we had our own mini apartment inside their home with an amazing shower! We parked our car with no problem in their parking lot overnight which was very convenient.  Alex was a great host laying out a breakfast spread for us in the morning. Nothing but praises, would come back again when visiting Boston."
7246272,72024716,2016-04-30,64184748,Christopher,My wife and I had a great stay with Alex & Bob!  Alex was a gracious host.  All communication was thorough and timely.

7246272,74944008,2016-05-17,45941975,Ziyi,"This is my best Airbnb experience. The bedroom is beautiful and cozy, with comfortable bed and sofa. The bathroom is clean and the shower is amazing! Alex (and Bob) is communicative. They even prepare public transit cards for us. I will definitely choose them again when I come back to Boston."
7246272,75439864,2016-05-21,65253701,Kristofer,An amazing place! We loved it. The shower was the best part about the room. It was huge! Everything else was awesome too. Nice bright colors and super clean.
Alex helped us out a lot! When we got there he printed out tour guides and info about the transportation in the city. When we had to leave Boston,we had a super early flight in the morning. I just mentioned that we had to leave early and he offered to take us,"without hesitation. We haven't been on Airbnb long but this one place made our whole trip. Alex and Bob are the best! Thank you so much for all the hospitality!\"",,,
7246272,76793384,2016-05-29,52037695,Binh (Edward),"I love this place so much. Bob and Alex are very gracious and friendly, who helped us a lot. The bedroom is cozy, beautiful, clean, and neat.

7246272,78853891,2016-06-09,68206754,Anna & Jasper,We stayed with Alex (and Rob) for a week on a holiday. Before we arrived Alex was helpful to make sure we would be able to find the place. The location is quite convenient. A 10-15 minute walk will get you to the metro that takes you to downtown Boston in less than 15 minutes.
Upon arrival Alex was there to welcome us and could always be reached if we needed anything. The room and the adjacent private bathroom were really nice and clean,just like how it is shown on the pictures. We had good nights of sleep on the comfortable bed and there was hardly any noise from outside. The room is nicely decorated and has a big TV. Wifi is also accessible and of good quality.,,,,
We were allowed to use the kitchen and Alex made space in the fridge available for us. There was fresh coffee when we wanted.,,,,,
Both Alex and Rob are very friendly people and are nice to talk to.,,,,,
We would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston. Next time we visit Boston we would certainly go for their place again!,,,,,

7246272,79816115,2016-06-14,38022907,Urooj,Alex and Bob were real nice. Their place was beautiful and even bigger than it looked in the pictures. Alex was real nice to let us know how to use the T and was super friendly. We had a great stay thanks to him :)
7246272,80418282,2016-06-18,36313125,Talley,"Alex & Bob were fantastic hosts. When we arrived, Alex was outside working in the yard, and greeted us with a warm smile & showed us the space. He gave us great advice on how to get on the subway, use Boston's public transit with ease, and gave us great tips on places nearby to eat. Our room was extremely clean and comfortable, which had complimentary bottled water, basket of beach goodies, and travel size toiletries in the bathroom for travelers to use. Alex and Bob have done an exceptional job at making this space complete with everything you might need during your stay. We loved our time here in Boston! Thank you Alex & Bob!"

It felt like being in an upscale yet home-y feeling condo...the room was beautiful and the bathroom and shower were spacious as well. We had a walk in closet, tv, desk, wifi, free parking spot and so much more that made our stay effortless and smooth. Alex was always there to answer questions if we had any or answered our messages very quickly. We would absolutely consider staying here again, we loved it! As soon as we walked into our room and met Alex we knew what a super host meant and how much he merits that title! Thanks for a great couple of days!"

我们是开车去的,所以不知道公共交通,但开车去市区还是很快,有一次去salem一不小心过了出口到了剑桥。房东有免费车位提供。,,
所有硬件条件已经很够商业了,只能让你感觉这是房东完全按照自己的标准设置的,包括单独的衣帽间,宽大的洗手间,洗手间里有三种独立的淋浴方式,角落沙发
软件更加过分,首先共享所有空间和电器及备品,他告诉你怎样怎样,虽然不大会用,但态度非常诚恳。淋浴室准备了洗发水、沐浴露、洗面奶、剃须泡沫等,还有空气清新剂。因为不远处是很大的一个公共沙滩
他是做设计的,所以空间布置的很舒服,早餐我们自己弄,然后在各个角落试一下不同的感觉,都很有意思。,
遗憾的是我们没有太多时间和他交流,但我们相信下次一定会再来。,,,,
对了,有点小曲折,因为我们在导航仪上直接输入了他的地址,但samner51号提供了好多选择,我们选了波士顿,结果给我们弄到了东波士顿

Alex was well prepared with all the touring and transportation info I needed,there is even a load of pamphlets and brochures neatly placed in the room for the guest use.,,,,
The bathroom had a wide range of shampoos and soaps to choose from,towels neatly cleaned and lavender fresh.,,,,
The neighborhood is very quiet and the windows appeared to be are very well insulated for sound,"that along with the comfort and quality of bedding made for a perfect night rest.  The temperature within the room was also very pleasant with just the right touch of cool and very mild humidity.\"",,,,

"You also have Wi-Fi and a private parking spot!\"",,,,,
7246272,93958469,2016-08-14,40179319,Amara,Room is as pictured.
In many air bnb's the spare room is just an after thought but Alex and Bob have put a lot of care into creating a cosy and welcoming space that is done to a high standard; beautiful hardwood floors,extremely comfortable bedding,large walk-in shower with power jet options and nice soft towels! Curtains are black out thickness so I slept very peacefully.,,,
The whole room and en-suite bathroom were exceptionally clean. There is a side entrance to the apt that opens by the room so it gives a sense of privacy when coming and going.,,,,,

The place was in a fantastic location, very close to the T (subway) and bus lines, close to Fenway park and some bars and restaurants."
The apartment was really comfortable and clean,and very very cutely decorated.  He was kind enough to allow us to use his desktop computer even as we had traveled without one.,,,,
He also left extra blankets for us as it was a very very unusually cold weekend.  :-),,,,,
The place felt very safe as there is a separate keyed entry to the building in addition to the lock on the apartment.  It was quiet in the building.,,,,,

1365335,12118271,2014-04-23,11400703,Analee,This apartment is exactly as described and was perfect for myself and a couple family members. Christine is an excellent communicator with a noticeable love of her city and care for her home. The place has a fully equipped kitchen and living room with a great printed guide to the home and neighborhood and a small widescreen TV in the bedroom. It sort of has a cottage feel in the big city. There is no elevator however there are 2 flights of narrow stairs to navigate. The neighbors are nice and extremely quiet and the building is well maintained and safe. My family and I loved our stay 100%!

1365335,13744982,2014-06-03,14294975,Amy,"We had an excellent stay at Christine's apartment. The apartment is very spacious for the city, clean, and has an amazing large bathroom. She also has a nice flat screen TV with VCR/DVD player. The process was very easy to stay with her. The location of the apartment is perfect, close to both the subway and bus system, is on a side street with little traffic, and a half block from a very nice park. The stay was wonderful!!"
1365335,14631678,2014-06-23,794070,Bradford,"The apartment and location are perfect, with plenty of nearby shops and cafes. It's a perfect location to explore the entire city."
1365335,20244440,2014-09-26,122720,Mariel,"Even though Christine was overseas during my stay, her warmth and sense of welcome was so abundantly clear in the emails that I felt like she was not far away at all.  Her home is lovely--feels quite European in fact, so visitors from across the Atlantic would feel right at home."
The neighborhood is beautiful -- restaurants and coffee shops and parks within a couple of blocks.,,,,,
She responded to correspondence with lightning speed.  I had to figure a lot of things out before booking,and she was incredibly patient through that process.,,,,
A very generous host who was very kind and flexible about checkout times and insisted that I make myself at home!,,,,,

1365335,32459719,2015-05-18,27732339,Tom,"Christine was the perfect host - helpful before and during our stay. She left abundant maps and recommendations for us to use during our stay, so needless to say she was extremely helpful. The flat itself is elegant and charming (the picture doesn't do it justice), and is located in a beautiful neighbourhood in the south end of Boston. It's a stone's throw away from loads of great restaurants, and is also just about walking distance to the town centre. There's a bus near by if you're not up for the walk!"
1365335,33016825,2015-05-24,20024706,Andrea,"Christine was incredibly helpful and generous. She provided a lot of helpful information before I had even left home, and then called me to be sure I had reached her apartment safely. The neighborhood was lovely and the apartment just as described. It was very clean, comfortable, and charming, with all the amenities. She checked in during my stay to be sure everything was going well, and even let me leave my bags there on my last day. I highly recommend her as a host, and would be happy to stay in her place again next time I visit Boston."
1365335,33506666,2015-05-29,28708713,Sarah,"I really enjoyed staying at Christine's lovely apartment!  I was there for a week attending a conference at the Boston Convention and Expo Center, and Christine gave me very clear and easy directions from her apartment to the Convention Center.  She was very communicative before I arrived, and checked in with me via email during the week to make sure everything was OK.  She was very generous and helpful, and I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Boston!  The neighborhood is very historical with lots of character - way better than a generic hotel!"
9610609,64980716,2016-03-09,1396918,Eric,"\"Judith kindly accommodated a late request for a place in Boston. Things worked out great. The location was ideal, with the waterfront and the Italian North End right there. The room itself faces into an interior atrium (not directly outside). It's plenty roomy, although not yet fully furnished. I knew this going in, and expect that Judith will do great things with the space. Pictures of the interior would have been helpful when I was \"\"shopping.\"\"\""
9610609,65716595,2016-03-16,59807817,Cory,Awesome place right in the middle of the north end of Boston. Within walking distance of all the historical sites.

My train coming into Boston prevented me from meeting with her when we originally planned and she was more than accommodating in terms of re-scheduling out meet up. Overall, cool building in an even cooler location! It was a great experience!"

Apartment 4 was tidy and cosey,however the wifi did not work and the sofa bed was rickety making it difficult to relax on.,,,,
All in all a very basic apartment,"suitable for people who need only somewhere to sleep and shower.\"",,,,
4573458,26893640,2015-02-21,27639281,Lijing,"The apartment is not really big but nice and bright. The owner provides all utensils in the kitchen for guest to cook. The beds are soft and we all feel well sleeping on them.  And there are a lot of Italian restaurant around so we shall have delicious food during the two days. In addition, many gelateria are available near the apartment. The only thing that should be concerned is : the password of the Internet on the guidebook is incorrect, I called the hot line and the one on the phone said she will fix it on the following morning. However, when my friends and I came back to the apartment in the evening, the problem had not been solved. Anyway, we do enjoy our trip in Boston and staying in this apartment."
4573458,28077802,2015-03-17,16994827,Isabella,"Everything was perfect! The apartment is beautiful, clean, cozy and has all the facilities you may need, including blow dryer! The location is a plus. Right next to North End's main street (Hanover St), which has tons of nice italian restaurants, and less than 10 min walk to the T (Haymarket Station). My parents and I loved it!"

4573458,28389248,2015-03-23,8624984,Vero,This appartment was perfect and cozy.  The location was ideal for our needs and the public parking was 2 minutes walk from the appartment.  Many restaurants and a small grocery store nearby the appartment.  We enjoyed our stay! thanks!
4573458,28563755,2015-03-26,12130111,Kraig,"We got our exercise, that's for sure.  The apartment building is a block off the Freedom Trail and a block and a half from Paul Revere's house - a great take-off spot to city some of Boston's most famous landmarks.  And with the apartment being on the fourth floor, that helps too.  The place was clean, the beds comfortable - a nice place to call home for our 4 day visit."
Located in the middle of North Boston,we were minutes away from an incredible selection of restaurants,coffee shops,and Mike's Pastry - don't miss it.  If you enjoy improvisation or comedy,the Improv Asylum is a fun and inexpensive thing to do 7 nights a week and just three blocks away.,
"The apartment is only six blocks from the \"\"T\"\" - Boston's metro system that will get you anywhere in the city",so don't rent a car.  Parking on the North end is not easy or inexpensive.  Just use the public transportation or take a cab,which are plentiful.,,,
"I would recommend this spot.\"",,,,,
4573458,30597412,2015-04-25,23864923,Ally,This place was very clean and SUPER location.  Easy to pick up keys and great directions given.   Very happy with the whole experience!

4573458,33570334,2015-05-30,2103376,Mette,"Hurtig og fin respons på henvendelser. Okay lejlighed med 2 små soveværelser og det mest nødvendige grej i lejlighed og køkken. Den ene seng knirkede en del, og det ville have været dejligt med et par vinglas. Godt og hurtigt internet. Helt fantastisk beliggenhed midt i det italienske kvarter med skønne lokale butikker og restauranter. Tæt på Harbor Walk, hvor vi tog et par vidunderlige løbeture i de tidlige morgentimer. Og tæt på Hubway cykel-station, så det var nemt at komme omkring."
4573458,34192163,2015-06-06,27747296,Robert,A great property in a fantastic location. Perfect for us and far better than a hotel. The property was a good size and had all the amenities that we needed. Good value in a city that has expensive lodging options. Would absolutely recommend.
4573458,37688181,2015-07-09,36480585,Joshua,"\"Great location! Apartment is clean, well-stocked, and comfortable. Wifi, appliances, and fixtures worked well. The process for getting/returning keys is a bit of a hassle, but worth it. It mentions that it is \"\"4th fl.\"\" but should really mention a warning about the stairs. There are a lot of them and they are steep. Wouldn't recommend it if you are out of shape"
4573458,38478534,2015-07-16,27423786,Joel,This is a beautiful little apartment in the historic North End of Boston.  It's close to Hanover Street and only steps from the Freedom Trail.
4573458,40313787,2015-07-30,2521868,Kjartan,The apartment was as advertised. It was clean and comfortable. The location is great and easy to walk anywhere.
4573458,42385629,2015-08-13,32502261,Elvia,"Nice place in a lovely neighborhood. Dror and his staff were very kind, professional and so helpful before and during our stay.  Easy check-in and check-out. The apartment is pretty basic but functional and clean - located in the heart of the North End, very close to many lovely places, shops and restaurants. Be aware that it is a historical building and there is no elevator, so if you book apt. #4 (4th floor) I suggest to travel with no heavy baggage."
Overall this was a positive experience.,,,,,

4573458,44755266,2015-08-29,14835606,Giulia,Appartamento molto bello nel cuore del North End. Unico neo: al quarto piano senza ascensore. Pulizie da migliorare ma per gli standard americani buono. Mai incontrato l'host: il recupero e il rilascio delle chiavi facile anche se bisogna chiamare il giorno prima dell'arrivo un numero verde americano.
4573458,80334477,2016-06-17,35303560,Yunzhou,"The location is great, with very nice Italian restaurants in the neighborhood. Though we didn't meet with Dror in person, he responded quickly. I would highly recommend this place to family and friends who would like to visit Boston."

It is also 20min walks from financial district,and was great for our business trip.,,,,

4573458,85492035,2016-07-11,8263798,Hannah,"This place was charming and in a fantastic neighborhood for cafes, nightlife, delicious food and in walking distance to public transportation. Dror also provides a place for you to store your luggage for early arrival/late departure, which was convenient and appreciated. I would most definitely stay here again."
4573458,86510771,2016-07-16,12524214,David,"Reliable key pick-up arrangements, top floor flat hard work to drag suitcases up to (but we knew that). Welcome pack enough for a meal or two available on arrival was appreciated. Minimal air conditioning just about coped in 34degC temperatures, but toilet plumbing failed on our last evening and we've had no apology for that. As made clear, the location is everything with this flat, right in Little Italy but hidden away round a quiet corner from the busyness of Hanover Street. Also very convenient for the short, easy walk to most tourist attractions downtown."
4573458,91868762,2016-08-07,40550879,José Pablo,"Great location. Apartment is somewhat small, although very comfortable and the neighborhood is nice, with an old-european style."

Very clean, comfortable and convenient ... our vacation to Boston was made that much better because of our accommodations. We love visiting cities and feeling like we live there and 20 Moon Street made us feel like we were at home in another city. The location can't be beat! 10 minutes from the airport. The restaurants, shops and sites in the North End all seemed to be within a few minutes walk. 10 minute walk to Quincy Market and waterfront attractions. We had no trouble getting anywhere in the city we wanted to go. We will definitely be staying here again on future visits to the city.  Dror's listing and hospitality were exactly as advertised and then some."

The room is nice, the kitchen is very well furnished (was happy to use Greek ibrik for making coffee every morning), the district is safe and beautiful (hills are good for running). I made my 'last-minute' booking and was delighted with that choice. And Karin's cats are super cool!"

The room was clean, towels were laid out for me and there were two sweet kitties to greet me.  Karin made me feel very welcome, she respected my privacy and was a great resource as far where to explore while I was there.  The neighborhood was pleasant, quiet and very close to a large park.  I highly recommend staying with Karin if you can."

The room was just as I expected, and I had everything I needed.  When I came in on my last night, I heard the theme from Downton Abbey playing on Karin's TV, and she graciously invited me to watch the show with her; much appreciated! And I enjoyed the cats, too."

The location is fantastic 5/10 minutes walk to the train station (T) that it takes less than 15 minutes to City Centre. (Try the Mexican restaurant at Amory St.,before going back home,you wont regret it). Karin was really helpful providing advice and suggestions for my stay in Boston.,,,

It is close to the T, barely a 3 minute walk from the Green Line, on a side street. There are 2 Starbucks nearby, as well as a good grocery store. Lots of restaurants and bars in walking distance. Everything in the apt is set for the user, rather than being the host's space. The service, and communication for check-in is excellent. In the price range it was an excellent choice. Very pleased."

Checking in/out was seamless and Christian was very easy to get in touch with."
4610745,29297718,2015-04-06,27243087,Nastassia,I planned this trip to Boston as a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday and Christian's apartment was absolutely perfect for us! The location is so convenient to everything.  We had two events to attend at TD Garden and we were able to walk over there in only  about 10-15 minutes.  To get anywhere else we jumped on the T just up the street from the apartment which made things so easy.
As for the apartment itself,it was very cozy and gave us the feel of what it would be like to live in the city.  We have no complaints whatsoever although,I do feel it's worth noting that the staircase in the building is narrow and steep and the bathroom is also very small since the building is old.  We found the historical feel of the building cool but neither of us is particularly big/tall so it may not be as comfortable for someone of larger stature. That being said,we found the apartment to be phenomenal.  We would definitely love to stay there again.,,
Not only was the place great,Christian was also the ideal host.  We didn't get to meet him in person but he was so pleasant through all our communication,was quick to respond to any questions I had,and even went the extra mile by offering us detailed recommendations for his favorite spots near the apt and around Boston.,,

Very friendly, sent us a list of places to go and even brought us a Red Sox cap and left beers in the fridge for us! Even when we had a little mishap and accidentally shorted the power he was quick to reply and directed us expertly with how to resolve the problem! Easy fix and smooth running after that! The apartment was as described and I think better than the pictures on here. Lovely old building. I adored the location and it was easy to get around. Honestly a perfect little getaway. Just what we needed. I can't say enough about it! I would recommend to anyone visiting Boston either for a short weekend away or a longer time. I have also never slept so well!

He provided us with beers and soda in the fridge, towels and shampoo, and gave us great advice on where to go to hang out. The apartment itself was fairly old and small, with the bathroom located in the building's stairwell.

We have also stayed in many European style places but this bathroom was the least practical we have ever encountered. It was nearly impossible to take a shower and the toilet was in the hallway.  Christian was very nice, I would recommend this place for the location alone."

The neighborhood was my favorite part, just steps to a great street with shopping and restaurants and I felt very safe. Thanks!"
4610745,85232198,2016-07-10,48166433,Kurt,Christian was great!  He answered all our questions throughout our stay and new the city very well. Best of all he left us a list of a handful of places to go to which were described as well.  This was our first time using Airbnb and we couldn't be happier with the experience.
4610745,86892754,2016-07-17,83468124,Wenlher,Christians place was great! He was very helpful and responsive when questions arised. He left us a red sox baseball hat to welcome us to the city and also have us tips and ideas for places to eat and explore. I would recommend this place to anyone!
4610745,89242937,2016-07-27,29182468,Lida,"As others have said, the location is great.  I found the place to feel like the bachelor pad I guess it is.  The bed was really comfortable. It was clean and tidy.  The bathroom is a bit awkward but workable:  you have to go out in the hallway and it is TINY!  A great buy."

The space was nice, a little small, but very cozy. The private patio was a plus. The historic neighborhood is always friendly and quiet. Not a far walk to the ferry that will take you downtown Boston. Or a little longer walk over the scenic bridge. I will definitely stay here again, when I visit next. If available!"
12432535,92041573,2016-08-07,83937190,Joan,"Overall a very good air bnb experience. The one issue we had was that the window sills and a lot of the tables/desks and bedroom bench were dusty and there were quite some bugs and tiny house spiders and spider webs, but not a big problem as it just requires a little more thorough cleaning. The beds, sheets, and bathrooms were very clean. Greg is also very quick to respond to messages and the apartment is easily accessible through cab and public transportation."
12432535,94014400,2016-08-14,3340717,Lisa Marie Phoenix,"Greg is an attentive host whose home I would highly recommend. Upon reaching out to him regarding needing last minute housing during Comic Con weekend in Boston, he promptly turned around a response within one to two hours. The quaint private deck is a small space that is ideal for reading one of the classic books he leaves on the living room ledge. The space comfortably sleeps 3 with the air bed included."
12432535,98003226,2016-08-29,90459358,Stacey,Greg was a great host during our weekend trip to Boston. The apartment is in a great location. We primarily walked during our trip and was able to find and walk to where we needed within a reasonable distance.  We completely fell in love with the neighborhood and would definitely stay at Greg's for our next visit.

The place is exactly as expected from looking at the pictures, and located in a very nice area of Boston, quiet but still close to the places we wanted to go to. I would certainly return to Greg's apartment next time I go to Boston."

9857,5258160,2013-06-21,5881085,Jennifer,"Our experience renting and staying in Boston was excellent.  The location on Beacon Street was perfect - very easy walk to everything, relatively quiet, and unit was very clean and accommodating.  The reasons for 4 stars rather than 5 are - place a little smaller than anticipated, but I guess that is City living; the unit was on the 5th floor and although the building had an elevator it didn't fit 2 adults, 2 kids and a stroller; and, the building façade was under construction so it blocked any views and sun light.  However, I would do again and would use this service."
9857,5393746,2013-06-28,5753987,David,"This 2BR was is a fantastic location.  About a block from the Make Way for Ducklings statues in the Public Gardens.  The unit is small, but as expected in a city like Boston.  It is very nicely equipped and was clearly recently renovated.  The elevator is a plus given that it was on the fifth floor of the building.  Check in and check out was very easy."
9857,7303002,2013-09-15,4062028,Stephanie,"Great apartment with plenty of room. We were a party of 4 adults and had plenty of space. Great set up with comfy beds, towels and all the luxuries of a hotel without the price tag. Great communication and would definitely stay here again. A little gem!!"
9857,7362736,2013-09-17,3312378,Don,We had a great stay and enjoyed our time in Boston.  And the location was PERFECT.  The apartment is clean and very functional.
I would stay there again but future guests should be aware that:,,,,,
1.  The WiFi is a pain... it kicks you off every hour or so and you have to completely log back in again via your email address and a password.  Seems really unnecessary.,,,,,
2.  The 2nd bedroom does not have any sort of heating or cooling.  So in order to keep it somewhat cool (in summer) you have to leave the door open and the window (there is a strange window between the 2nd bedroom and the living room) open.  Not a problem in many situations for families but we were two couples and it made the sleeping arrangements a bit awkward.  It is MUCH better than just a sleeper couch in the living room,but effectively not as private as you would expect from a 2nd bedroom.  But given the old nature of the building and the location of the 2nd bedroom,there's not an easy fix for the owner,,,
Again,don't let the two issues above deter you... we had a great stay and the location is amazing.,,,,

9857,7663739,2013-09-29,5804393,Harry,"Brilliant location in proximity to so many attractions and transport.  To suggest that the apartment is spacious in the promotion of the property is perhaps an exaggeration. The kitchen is well appointed but the 2 bedrooms are very cramped.

There's even a group of shops and local restaurants within walking distance that serve incredible food at reasonable prices if you want to get breakfast or dinner before or after a day traveling around town.  Though we were in and out at odd hours, Vanessa was highly accommodating to even such an awkward schedule.   Next time I visit Boston, I wouldn't hesitate to ask to stay at her residence once again!"
9971054,68209568,2016-04-02,984839,Madeleine,"Vanessa house is located in a nice and quiet neighbourhood, at a walkable distance from T train. Better love cats as Vanessa have 3! Home settings are basic, might fit expectations for a simple crash and sleep spot."

It is clean with no weird smells, which I very much appreciated. Greg responded quickly during the stay, and was proactive about checking in and making sure we had everything we need. There is lots of space to store your stuff. My only issue: the water pressure was too low in the shower and it was a bit dark in the bathroom. Other than that, Greg as a host was super AWESOME."

We had a party of 3 and Greg set this expectation upfront.  Everything in his description was dead on. Subway is 10 minutes away by walk and Uber or Lyft are everywhere.  Greg stopped in to make sure everything was perfect and was fully accessible if we needed him. Having access to a washer and dryer was fantastic as well. I would recommend this condo to anyone.

Good access to public transport with 2 minutes walk to bus station and 15 minutes walk to Broadway tube station. The place is renovated and everything is fresh and new, no smell or dump. Very large kitchen that has everything you need for cooking. Nice and efficient air condition which is needed in summer.

3992208,19239412,2014-09-08,20722576,Will,"The apartment was exactly as advertised: small and nothing fancy, but immaculately clean, comfortable, and in a fantastic location. Sean was incredibly accommodating and fast to communicate, and made it effortless to get our key. He even gave us a place to leave our bags for the day after checking out before our late train left. The bed was comfortable, the air conditioner kept us comfortable despite 90+ degree heat outside, and we got the whole apartment to ourselves."
"I can't imagine a better place to stay if you want a private retreat while exploring Boston.\"",,,,,
3992208,19488134,2014-09-13,19641034,Max,"The apartment is really close to the places to be. Fenway park with its bars and pubs is directly round the corner. The neighborhood is cool and you have there everything you need (the T, 7-11, Starbucks...)"
Because of the close bars and the stadium it is from time to time quite loud. The other guys in the house aren't too disturbing.,,,,,
The apartment is short but it has everything you need but it could be cleaner.,,,,,
"I would come back anytime...\"",,,,,
3992208,19698287,2014-09-16,20279055,James,The listing was lovely and in a great location. It was smaller than the listing pictures showed but only the kitchen was at all cramped. Saturday morning it got extremely noisy for twenty minutes at 6 am due the windows overlooking the dumpster. We also had Wifi problems that were not fixed. Ultimately did not detract from our experience much and was a lovely weekend.
3992208,20296277,2014-09-27,17697650,Daniel,A really good location with view to the Red Sox Studium and a lot of bars and restaurants around the corner. The apartment itself is really quiet as it is faced to the back of the building. We had a good stay and can recommend this place definitely.
3992208,20438064,2014-09-29,20691491,Jody,"The apartment was awesome. Just as described in the listing. Location could not have been better as I stayed there because I was attending a Red Sox game. Apartment was what you would expect from an older city apartment. Nothing luxurious but what a real city apartment looks like. Neighborhood was very safe to walk around at all hours and lots of restaurants and bars. There is no TV though in the apartment, but the wifi works great so you can stream from an ipad if need be. Sean was awesome very accommodating, and answered me quickly with any  emails or questions I had. I would definitely stay here again."
3992208,20517417,2014-09-30,6254732,Treesa,"Pretty much just a clean room with a bed.  Really, that's all I needed.  And it was affordable.  And Sean was great and helpful.  It really has NO amenities, which is true to the listing, but I left some shampoo there so it might still be there when you stay there.  :)"
3992208,20612604,2014-10-02,19262129,Chris,If you are a Puritan this is the place for you. With absolute bare walls and an extra mattress leaning against one you will not be overwhelmed by the details. No shelves or night stands to put your stuff on. Even the wifi cables and router sit on the floor in a tangle of wires.
The kitchen is like something out of an Eastern European flat. So cramped you can barely fit between the counter and the stove. You can only open the fridge door a quarter of the way. But it does have a gas stove.,,,,,
The bathroom has cracked plaster in the shower area and the shelf in the shower is mildewed with the laminate wood coming up.,,,,,
Our alarm clock in the morning consisted of the garbage truck at 5:45 am picking up the dumpsters outside our window (which was gone through every couple of hours through the night by street people). Then from 7:00 until just after 8:00 we got to hear the loud music of the neighbor while they got ready for the day.,,,,,
"Sean is very quick to respond to questions and give information. And the location is great for getting around Boston. \"",,,,,

3992208,21361456,2014-10-15,2941879,Faye,"The listing was accurate and the studio was clean. Sean was accessible via text when I had a little confusion about how to get into the building, and helped me resolve the issue immediately, which I really appreciated. Overall, my stay was easy and comfortable. My only bit of advice to future travelers would be potentially not to stay at this location on a Monday night since Tuesday morning was apparently a garbage pickup day, and since the apartment is right above the back alley of the building it was quite loud early in the morning. But hey, it's a city and that might just be par for the course in this neighborhood!"
3992208,21467649,2014-10-18,20236775,Erika,"Great location especially if you are going to attend a baseball game. The apartment itself is small, quiet and as the listing says there are no amenities (no tv). Sean was very clear and we had no issues during our stay."
3992208,21588957,2014-10-20,10038683,Diane,"We had a hugely busy schedule in town and this location was perfect. If I were vacationing and looking for a place to relax, I may have been disappointed. There is a full little galley kitchen which we didn't use and small table and chairs in the studio. Having a comfortable bed in a quiet building at an affordable price was exactly what I bargained for."
"Sean was readily available and responded to inquiries quickly. \"",,,,,
3992208,21665510,2014-10-21,21345963,Leo,We had a pleasant experience. The description of the place was quite accurate as it was indeed suitable for 3 adults. The beds were also very comfortable. Our stay was made even more enjoyable since the host was very accommodating. We would stay here again on our next visit.
3992208,22298640,2014-11-03,10657475,Michael,"The location is perfect! My wife and I wanted to stay within walking distance of our family in Back Bay, and we were able to do so here for a fraction of the price of a hotel. The apartment is small, but clean, and Sean is a very accommodating host. We were able to check-in and check-out as our schedule demanded without any issues."
Regarding some of the other comments about noise,it is pretty noisy,especially Friday night. But it's pretty typical city noise. Sean can't control when the garbage gets picked up.,,,
Overall,"we had a great experience and would be happy to stay here again next time we visit Boston! \"",,,,

A perfect place to stay in the Fenway area of Boston. I'll stay here again if I return to the city."

Dentro del apartamento nos encontramos con un refrigerador apagado y al abrirlo tenía comida en descomposición (se quedó cerrado toda la estancia),por consiguiente nos obligó a efectuar mas gastos imprevistos desayunos y cenas,la cama supletoria era un colchón en el suelo y además  el polvo creo que no se había limpiado en tiempo.,,,
La verdad es con toda seguridad no lo volvére a contratar y por supuesto dudo que se lo recomiende a nadie.,,,,,
"Saludos\"",,,,,
3992208,22999922,2014-11-19,963401,Maurene,"While Sean was very courteous and responsive in setting up the reservation, once we arrived in Boston we had to take a train to meet him to pick up our keys which was fairly inconvenient as we had hoped to take a cab in the rainy weather directly to the apartment. I think as a host, if you make an error (like forgetting to leave keys in a lock box), you should meet the guests at the location. I was uncomfortable suggesting it, however. The apartment itself was in a great location (near a T station), clean, and spare and I appreciated the wifi. Like the other reviewers have said, there is really loud noise (garbage trucks? We had no idea what it was) directly outside the window starting late at night and into the morning. This is absolutely not an exaggeration. If you can sleep through that, then you may not be bothered. Location was convenient and it was a good price for an entire apartment but I wouldn't stay here again due to the few (large) inconveniences."
3992208,23011887,2014-11-20,1558800,Steve,"Sean was easy to communicate with, and flexible on check-in time, which was great.  His apartment was easy to find, and the neighborhood was great:  close to numerous restaurants, theaters, etc."
3992208,23057937,2014-11-21,23940506,John,Host had a friendly attitude.  The apartment description was accurate and the Fenway neighborhood had lots of fun things to do.  I appreciated that the kitchen had a full set up.

We found the sheets on the bed and had to do it ourself but the real bad surprise was having to clean the toilets before use.,,,,,
We only stayed 2 days but we had the visit of a pest control society while we were out and met a bug in the bathroom...,,,,,

3992208,23548103,2014-12-04,21478410,Jo,"The apartment is in a nice location close to the center of the City and closeby Fenway stadium. It offers all the basics for a short stay in Boston. Although we did not meet Sean personally, he was easy to get in touch with."
3992208,23680099,2014-12-08,15213959,Nicole,"We had a great time staying at the studio apartment. It was very easy to communicate with Sean throughout our stay. We never met, but I felt like everything we needed was attended to.  The directions provided for finding the apartment and getting the key from the lock box were very clear. The location was fantastic, right across the street from a very nice park and around the corner from Fenway Stadium and House of Blues concert venue. Everything was exactly as described, I will definitely stay there again next time I go to a show in Boston!"
3992208,23818307,2014-12-11,20058424,Jeremy,"Sean was a great host - location was amazing (Fenway right out the window), nearby the subways and transit, lots of cool stuff within walking distance. Apartment had everything we needed, and Sean was very helpful and quick to respond before and even during the trip."
3992208,24222938,2014-12-23,8844503,Sarah,"The apartment is in the wonderful Fenway area, close to many restaurants and things to do.  The apartment itself is small, but adequate.  It was wonderful to have our own kitchen so we didn't need to eat out all the time!  There was occasional morning noise outside the window, but most mornings were quiet.  If you do plan to bring a car, the cheapest parking is $20/night at a nearby gas station."
3992208,24397723,2014-12-27,25169146,Alex,This was overall an extremely pleasant experience. Sean was a great host and the place was very clean and the location was great! We would definitely stay here again.

Mais sans instructions cette recherche s'est transformée en véritable chasse au trésor. Une fois les clefs trouvées nous avons découvert un appartement minuscule avec le stricte minimum pour 2 personnes . Comme nous étions 4 il nous manquait des coussins et une couette .Cependant"
3992208,24937826,2015-01-04,4000406,Shawn,Corresponding with Sean was great as his replies were prompt and he readily answered our queries over email.
The flat was located in an excellent location and my friends and I could even walk to downtown from there though the subway will definitely be quicker. But if you are looking to soak in the sights,walking is a good choice. The walk too us through Boylston street,which I guess is one of the shopping belts in Boston given the number of shops and restaurants there.,,,

3992208,25687702,2015-01-23,25432629,Ryan,Dwelling was exactly as described and Sean was extremely helpful. Definetly recommend the Kenmore area and Sean as your host.

3992208,28584975,2015-03-26,1952186,Erin,Great location. Nice bars and restaurants nearby. Apartment is basic but adequate for a place to crash and a home base for seeing the city.
3992208,28871265,2015-03-31,70550,Amy,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for four nights while I checked out the nearby Northeastern University for law school. The location for such visits is great - around the corner from the T stop and Boston University and across the park from Northeastern. It was also a less than 15 minute walk to the MFA and the Isabella Stewart Gardner, which were two of our must-sees. Several decent restaurants (check out El Pelón) and a grocery store nearby. I felt like the listing experience was accurate and Sean was super accommodating about possible bag storage issues. Key pick up was smooth. Studio covers the basics and would be a good option for such grad school visits, or people who wanted to focus on the art museums."
"The biggest negatives about the stay were not things in his control. The first is that at 3am on Saturday morning some (likely) drunk (likely) undergraduate idiot went through and continuously buzzed through all of the apartments for about fifteen minutes and the second is that on Monday morning the garbage truck is literally right outside your window before seven in the morning. Which was so loud my boyfriend could hear it through his silicone earplugs (although he couldn't hear the the apartment buzzer so they're probably still worth bringing).\"",,,,,
3992208,28929566,2015-04-01,6395269,Jen,I only needed the apartment for the night as I was seeing a show at The House of Blues which is just around the way.  It was small and tidy and so close to good food and other attractions.

The only thing was getting the keys, when my girlfriend went to get them from the lockbox there were keys for 2 different places there and if Sean hadn't happened to arrive at that moment we wouldn't have known which keys were ours. Otherwise great communication from Sean and a great stay!"

El departamento lleno de estudiantes y el barrio con varios bares para recorrer. Lo unico es que habia un pasaje hacia trasero hacia donde daba el departamento que no nos gustaba mucho algo feo y el depto al estar en un primer piso nos dio un poco de miedo los ruidos ya que teniamos que dormir con la ventana abierta por el calor que hacia dentro de la habitacion,,,,,

Loved the internal heating after coming in from the chilly Boston wind. Sean was very prompt at returning messages and gave great detail. Flexibility on check in was still dependent on previous occupant.  Getting the key was reasonably easy and straight forward.  We found it to be a good Central location to what we wanted to see. Found an excellent online review about a restaurant a few blocks away called sweet cheeks and was so glad we checked this out- fantastic."

the negatives were,we arrived at 3pm with check in time being after 12pm we thought we would be fine. Sean was there cleaning the room when we arrived which was no big deal. what bothered me was it looked like someone had either urinated in the sheets or spilled something because there was a pile of the dirty sheets with a huge wet spot; that grossed me out.,,,,
the room was basic,and worked for a night. I think possibly we might just be old for such an experience. I am in my mid 30s and used to staying in decent hotels. if I was in my early 20s would have been totally fine with the place.,,,,
I guess I was trying to get a bargain and you basically get what you pay for. the room was clean enough,"great location but i would opt to pay more for a nicer place.\"",,,,

Sean was communicative about getting into the unit, which he said would be ready by noon. When we got there at 12:30, there were wet towels on the chair and the bedsheets hadn't been changed. We wouldn't have noticed were it not for the fact that both the towels and comforter had been replaced when we stopped back in a few hours later."

3992208,33221667,2015-05-26,26223259,William,"Place was in a great location, right next to Fenway Park, can't beat it. Nice studio apartment was perfect for our visit. Please beware there is no parking at the unit, which may not matter for most as the subway is a short walk down the corner, but there is a public garage about 4 blocks away which was easy to use and only $10 for overnight parking. The unit is mostly filled with young people but was very quite and easy to use."
3992208,33490055,2015-05-29,22500612,Minh,"Sean was a great host.  Easy to get a hold of, he'll reply to messages promptly within the hour.  He's also very accommodating and flexible with changes in itinerary as long as it meets airbnb policies."
The location of the apt is very convenient,it's a 3-5 minute walk from the Kenmore Station on the D green line of the MBTA so you can easily get anywhere around Boston.  It's also within a 15 minute walking distance to the Prudential center and major eating establishments and of course Fenway Park is only 5 minutes away!  The area around the apartment is safe and clean.  The apartment itself is perfect for what I needed.  There are two Queen size mattresses there that will comfortably sleep 4 people.  The bathroom and kitchen are readily accessible.  There's also other essentials including AC and wifi internet.  The place suits my purpose well and I was really glad to have stayed there.,,,,
Thank you,Sean,"for the great stay!\"",,,
3992208,33617577,2015-05-30,23852972,Anna,"Sean was very quick to return emails during our stay and was helpful finding a place for me to park.  The neighborhood was nice and clean.  The space was utilitarian, which is just what I wanted."
3992208,34049551,2015-06-04,20925217,Michelle,"This studio flat is in a great location and easy to get around. Boston is expensive, so it is a bargain for a landing pad close to downtown. However, being a studio, it's probably better for one or a couple. Bath is great with good hot water which was welcome, and kitchen facilities are tight but there if needed. Worth noting if it's important to you that the laundry room is in the basement of a neighboring building. Easy to find lock box and communication was generally straightforward. Fenway is noisy during games but that can be a plus or a minus, we enjoyed the rock concert next door! I doubt you can find a cheaper place in such a good location but it is best described as basic."
3992208,34188231,2015-06-06,24633127,Vanessa,"The apartment was exactly as described. Sean let us check in early which was a great help. He provided easy to follow instructions on how to access the apartment. The location of the apartment is unbelievable. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to and it was only a short cab ride anywhere else. The apartment isn't big, as described, but we had four people and we were more than comfortable for a few nights. And for the price, it can't be beat. Thanks Sean, we had an amazing time in Boston!"
3992208,34282778,2015-06-07,8963352,Michela,"Everything was exactly as described. very good location, quite close to the Kenmore subway station and to the Fenway."
3992208,34791477,2015-06-12,18786330,Shaul,"The apartment is in a great location, despite the fact it is not in the best of shape it gives good value for money."
I had some trouble getting in as previous guests did not leave the key on time. Sean was quick to reply even though he was out of town and eventually things worked out. If your looking for something private,"central and not too expensive this is a good place to go.\"",,,,
3992208,34858619,2015-06-13,31047780,Justin,This listing is what it says on the tin: basic and clean with easy access to the Fenway area. The apartment does show its age but for a city as old as Boston that's to be expected.
It was a bit difficult to get responses from Sean closer to our stay and during the key pickup process--we had instructions but did find we had to figure some of the process out on our own while awaiting a response.,,,,,
"Good for a basic stay but may be more of an advanced process to stay here if you're an AirBnB first-timer.\"",,,,,
3992208,35069295,2015-06-15,10566811,Ian,Please read this review carefully.  I feel it is my responsibility to give the pros and cons very clearly....
PROS,,,,,
-Very cheap place to stay,,,,,
-This property is a FIVE minute WALK to Fenway,,,,,
-The wifi is super fast,,,,,
-The water is hot,,,,,
CONS,,,,,
-Everything else,,,,,
"Let me be clear:  This place met our needs for the \"\"guy weekend\"\"",which was to spend as much time at Fenway as we possibly could.  We were very appreciative of the short walk to the park,and the fast Wifi.  But,the apartment was basically a room with two mattresses on the floor,a tiny bathroom and a very,very tiny kitchen.  The air conditioner was underpowered
In addition,the host could have spent a hundred dollars on some functioning pillows,maybe a wash cloth or two,and some blankets for the second bed....,,
Sean was a little hard to reach with instructions,but I don't fault him too much for it as he did say he had been travelling.,,,,
Short version:  If you have a serious limit to your budget and want to spend your money and time on other things -- particularly Fenway -- and you don't care for much more than a mattress with some air conditioning and fast wifi,then this is your spot.,,,,
If,however,you want anything coming close to creature comforts,then you should move on and find something else.,,
I wish I was able to be more charitable,"but unfortunately this is the reality of this property. \"",,,,
3992208,35197295,2015-06-16,5657489,Brian,"Good experience.  Parking was a bit tricky; otherwise, no problems."
3992208,35378067,2015-06-18,30715140,Juanita,"We did not get to meet Sean but this place was perfect for us. My husband, 2 kids, and myself stayed here and it looks exactly as it does in the pictures. We went to Boston because my husband is a huge Red Sox fan and of course, we wanted to see the city. This place is about a 5 minute walk (or less) to Fenway. There is a lot in walking distance of the apartment. So we never had to go far. The apartment was clean and check in was smooth. I would definitely recommend this place! Thanks again, Sean!"
3992208,36082180,2015-06-25,26120265,Ann,"We were rather disappointed with this accommodatiion. The host did not even meet us, but left rather complicated instructions to access the keys to the apartment.  We did not meet the host at all during our stay, or even hear from him as to how we were getting on.  The apartment was somewhat shabby, and not really like the image indicated, as this only showed a small corner of one room.  The kitchen was tiny, and although quite well equipped, it badly needed redecoration and a good clean. In addition, the apartment backed onto a yard with three dumpsters, and on 4 occasions we were awakened early in the morning by the noise of the dumpsters being emptied."
3992208,36256201,2015-06-27,22421736,Nancy,I fell in love with the view of this apartment. Fenway out the window as promised. My expectations were pretty low going in because I realized it was very basic budget accommodations. Sean was helpful with the different questions I had about the city. The instructions for obtaining lockbox key were very clear. The location is great and the building old and had a lot of character. I came to town with a friend of mine for the night to catch the Red Sox game. We understood it to have a large enough bed to accommodate us since it says 1 to 4 people. When we arrived the bed seemed quite small. When I asked Sean about it he told me that there was 2 mattresses on top of each other and to take them apart and he thought that there were sheets in the closet for both  ( there were not) we had explored Boston all day and didn't return til 1 am..pulling a mattress apart was not what I wanted to do. We were so tired and since there was only 1 sheet we decided to just be very cozy. The bed was comfortable and we slept well until around 5 am when people were down in the alley going through glass bottles in the trash dumpsters which was very loud. (Not sure if that happens all the time) The kitchen is small but would be helpful if you needed one. I would not recommend having 4 people stay as it would be quite cramped ( but if you are looking for a budget place with a great view..this would work.  )
3992208,36853306,2015-07-02,24767999,Anne,"Lille lejlighed tæt på byen. Vi boede tre mennesker i lejligheden hvilket var fint i to nætter, og vi var næsten ikke i lejligheden. Køkken og bad kunne godt trænge til at blive gjort rent. Sean var meget venlig og hjælpsom. Svarede hurtigt tilbage på beskeder, og gav god forklaring til at finde lejligheden. Nemt at komme til fra lufthavnen."
3992208,36963867,2015-07-03,24730586,Kathy,Sean met us when we arrived. He provided helpful information about the area/parking.
I defer to Ian's June 2015 review. He nailed many of the issues I had with the rental. The apt is extremely small. It's an old,run down building. Stacked up mattresses. The place was very warm and stuffy. The a/c is underpowered. Peeling paint on ceiling. Oldish bed linens and towels. No wash cloths. Had to search for toilet paper. The place smelled. Floor was sticky. Stove had grime on burner. The sense of customer service was non-existent.,,,,
My husband and I arrived,stayed for a few minutes and explored Bodton. Returned around 10 pm. The place was hot and smelly. We left. Dropped the keys at the lock box inconvenient and across the highway. Homeless guy sleeping nearby. Dark area.,,,,
"I requested a partial refund. Sean replied no and said the issues I brought up were not accurate. They are accurate. I do not have very high expectations but it was beyond the pale. Like visiting a frat room cleaned of clutter.\"",,,,,
3992208,37117243,2015-07-04,2323759,Jonas & Luna,"Sean's place was decent considering the low price. We were stopping over in Boston for a night before heading out early next morning so we just needed a place to stay for the night, for that purpose the place worked out well. But it is very small and pretty run down so I would not recommend it for a longer stay unless you literally just are looking for a place to crash."
3992208,37545588,2015-07-08,1740551,Joan,"\"disgusting, disappointed, dirty. The two matress were disgusting and uncomfortable. The bathroom I can't explain it. In the fridge was some old food. Before we arrive we inform Sean that we would like to use the two beds. When we arrive, we dont find sheets for the seconf bed and we ask Sean what can we do, and he say we can go to find him somewhere and he can give us all what we need. This is service? The idea of Airbnb is \"\"feel like at home\"\""
3992208,38137092,2015-07-13,2530450,Ben,"The experience at this room was great, everything worked out as planned.  Easy check in process and Sean was communicative throughout.  The room was exactly as described, nothing fancy, just a small studio but that is all we needed.  Me and my wife were staying here specifically because of the location close to fenway, it is a 3 minutes walk out the door to the stadium, awesome location.  I would recommend."
3992208,38686907,2015-07-18,20773545,Annette,"If you are looking for a very basic accommodation, you are at the right place. We stayed here with four and to be honest this was too much for this appartment."
3992208,38856450,2015-07-19,3739775,Jolie,"The apartment was easy to find and enter.  We did not meet the host, though he gave very specific directions as to where we could pick up the key, as well as parking suggestions, and lots of ways to reach him in case we needed anything.  The apartment was definitely no frills, I think it is just used as a rental, but it was clean and everything we needed.  Very close to Fenway."
3992208,39141722,2015-07-21,783258,Ann,"Location, location, location.  I can't  express it any stronger.  The apartment is perfect.  Was there to see the Foo Fighters at Fenway and while everyone around was paying 40 to 50 to park, or even 400 a night for a hotel, we were able to take a leisurely stroll around the block and BAM! Back to our home away from home for the weekend.  Also wicked close to Kenmore station for taking the T. Sean was super helpful with check in instructions.  Hope to make it back again soon!"
3992208,39367687,2015-07-23,18836618,Judith,"Das Apartment entspricht genau der Beschreibung und den Bildern. Es  ist günstig gelegen - die Metro ist zirka 7 Minuten entfernt, Busse (sogar Hop-on-hop-off-Bus) halten an der nächsten Ecke. In der Nähe gibt es Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Fastfood-Restaurants. Die Gegend ist sauber und angenehm. Die Schlüsselübergabe verläuft ganz unkompliziert über eine Schlüsselbox in der Nähe. Das Apartment ist mit dem nötigsten ausgestattet und halbwegs sauber. Das Bett ist nicht sehr groß, die Matratze sehr weich. Sean schickte im Vorhinein eine E-Mail mit allen notwendigen Informationen und war während des Aufenthalts immer erreichbar. Für zwei Nächte war das Apartment eine angenehme Alternative zu den überteuerten Hotels in Boston."
3992208,39510018,2015-07-24,35513924,Ben,"Sean was a great host - always there to answer our messages via airbnb and he came out to us within 15 minutes when we had issues with the front door key! Great service. The key was a bit stiff in the lock, that's all - made us look stupid when Sean arrived to open the door immediately. The apartment had everything we needed - good shower, comfortable bed and provisions in the kitchen. Probably value for money considering its Boston."
3992208,39736367,2015-07-26,29662677,Chris,Easy to communicate with and a great location...right across from Fenway Park!!! Comfortable room and convenient location. Thank you for your hospitality.
3992208,40309962,2015-07-30,29910089,Adam,"Listing accurate, enjoyed staying at the apartment for the short time we were there.  Was extremely convenient to the T and to Fenway - which is why we went.  The hot water can be a little temperamental, but nothing bad.  We enjoyed it much more than staying in a hotel."
3992208,40787521,2015-08-02,2686714,Will,Very easy to work with. Responsive and thorough.
3992208,41059602,2015-08-04,27511159,Rosa,Descripción y situación bien explicada.
3992208,41198747,2015-08-05,27592629,Glenn,great location
3992208,41914701,2015-08-10,7335868,Laura,"Very convenient apartment - right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Would be perfect for someone attending a game or concert at Fenway. Thanks, Sean!"
3992208,42222953,2015-08-11,29030742,Amy,Great location and easy parking! Apartment is a little small but if you are going to fenway it's perfect. Ideal for baseball games or concerts in fenway- we saw Zac Brown and loved the location.
3992208,42387248,2015-08-13,24639370,Lorette,"The host was very nice, very easy to communicate with. The apartment was clean and exactly as pictured. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on. Nice, safe neighborhood. However, very noisy. It's an old building and I could hear every step taken by the person in the apartment above me. The apartment faces the alley behind the building and the noise started at 5:30am both days of my stay and didn't let up. The A/C wasn't very strong. I was there in mid-Aug and was only comfortable when I was sitting directly in front of it. I feel this apt is over-priced, but would be worth $100 a night if the Sox were having a home stand as it is literally around the corner from Fenway."
3992208,42816931,2015-08-16,17735436,Lindsay,"The location is excellent! Close to lots of great restaurants, shopping, grocery store, local transit and steps away from Fenway Park.  The apartment is tiny, suitable for two people.  It has air conditioning, wifi and meets very basic needs.  It faces a back alley which can be noisy at times and interrupt sleep.  If you're looking for luxury I do not recommend.  Overall it suits its purpose.  Sean was great to deal with.  The way he has it set up, it pretty well runs itself."
3992208,43026034,2015-08-17,30810239,Kip And Patty,"Just as pictured and described, very convenient for a visit to Fenway."
"Thanks Sean!\"",,,,,
3992208,44278472,2015-08-25,19847256,Dana,This apartment was great for our one night stay in Boston.  It was clean and just as the listing said.  The check in/out process was great and we would definitely recommend this booking.
3992208,45919937,2015-09-07,19515048,Devon,"We had a wonderful time! The location is great! Sean's instructions and perfectly clear and communicating with him was easy. Getting the door unlocked was a little tricky but once we figured it out, it was easy as can be. This was our first trip to Boston and after exploring much of the city, we still decided this would be a place we would stay again. Extremely close to Fenway and the Boston Back Bay Area, everything was in walking distance or just a subway ride away."
3992208,46370056,2015-09-10,27810699,Hily,"Sean, thanks for being such an awesome host for my boyfriend and I! The apartment was perfect for our needs. We went to the game at Fenway and it was a very short walk to the festivities! Bleacher bar before the game was a great spot! Great first time experience in Boston! We will be returning :)"
3992208,46575026,2015-09-12,24906213,Tawnya,Sean was a good host and provided clear instructions on accessing his apartment.  The place was clean and comfortable.  The bed was super soft and cozy!  This place is very convenient for getting around the city and is next to Fenway Park.  Thank you Sean for having us.  I would stay here again if traveling through Boston.
3992208,46954921,2015-09-14,42774057,Vincent,"Sean was friendly and always answered quickly. The apartment was as advertised. We found free parking on the North side of the bridge, which is a 10 minute walk away, not too far if you've previously unloaded all the bags."
3992208,47458386,2015-09-19,32461372,צביקה,Location is fine and technically the unit contains all you need . But the apartment requires refurbishment all over.
3992208,47613412,2015-09-21,15383226,Shawna,My husband and I stayed at Sean's place in order to see a show at the House of Blues.  It was a perfect place for us to crash and we could see the HOB from the bay window of his studio appartment!  Sean was an incredibly easy to reach and communicate with host.  The instructions to find the key lockbox ere clear and presice.  We had absolutely no trouble getting into the apartment.  We commincated through the airbnb site and it was flawless.  I did have his cell number just in case but never needed it.
Appartment was cozy and had everything we needed,just like the listing indicates.  Don't go in expecting luxuryl; we didn't and were very comfortable staying here for one night.  It's true what other reviewers said about city noises at night and in the early morning.  We were prepared for this and it was understandle and fine.  I'd like to contradict what other said about the room never cooling down.  When we were here,it was a hot day and night (80s in day,high 60s at night).  The a/c window unit was great if kept at the low setting.  We tried to crank it to high but when we came home after the show the apartment was stuffy.  So I put it back to low and it actually worked better and cooled the whole room nicely.  I slept great!  And the a/c unit helps drown out any noise outside the window,"which for us was just a few.  I would definitley stay here again with just my husband.  If I needed a place to stay with my whole family (we have 2 kids) think we could all fit fine but I might chose somewhere a little bigger.  Perfect though for a place to crash for a night on the town!\"",
3992208,47646469,2015-09-21,35716413,Jacob,"Sean was quick to contact and respond. His place was just as described, and just what my friends and I needed at the end of a long day: with a quiet, dark, cool room with soft beds, a small bathroom, and a kitchen. Picking up and leaving the keys were especially easy."
3992208,49091630,2015-10-01,29072968,Richard,This is a tough place to review.
On the plus side -Cost and location: The price is amazingly cheap. Boston's hotel market is insanely expensive. Any hotels in the area are likely almost double the cost. Also,the place is in a great neighborhood. We went to a Red Sox game and Fenway is just a few blocks away. There are tons of great restaurants and museums and other things to do within walking distance.,,,,
Communication with Sean was good. When we first arrived there was an issue with the key that was neither our fault or his,and he worked really hard to remedy the problem.,,,,
The negatives: We stayed four nights and I was just getting over a cold (not a great way to start a vacation) and this place is really just not that comfortable. It is basically a college student's studio apartment - no TV,no couch,no decor,beat up old towels and pillows,small bathroom and tight kitchen. Wifi worked great. For a night or two this would have been no problem,but by the fourth night it was a bummer to have to come back to after dinner. If I was feeling better and we were enjoying Boston's night life more
So,this place is perfect if you want a cheap place in a great neighborhood. If you just need a roof,a bed and a toilet,then there are no problems. However,If you want a comfortable,cozy apartment to relax in after a long day
3992208,49240780,2015-10-02,43131526,Kos,"Great location, very affordable. Sean was very responsive and helpful!"
3992208,50612422,2015-10-13,20975004,Nathalee,Accommodation was adequate although a bit of a squeeze for three guests with fairly large suitcases. Location was great. Host was quick to respond to questions and was helpful.
The cons I would say is that the apartment needs to have a makeover.,,,,,
If you are not fussy and staying for a couple of days,it will be an ok place to stay at.,,,,
If you are a light sleeper,"you will be awaken by the garbage collectors early in the morning. \"",,,,
3992208,51124417,2015-10-18,26311387,Manuel,"I happened to be near the flat when I met Sean. He seems a very nice man. He explain to me how to use the way to get the keys, which is very easy in any case. The flat is a bit old, but really cozy, and the bed is confortable. I stayed there just for one night, but I would recommend to you to rent this room because is very close to Boston downtown and you can go easily to everywhere, even in Allston or Cambridge (MIT, Harvard, Central...). If you go outbounds, down Boylston street, to the Red Socks stadium, you'll find many place to buy food and drinks. If you want to have breakfast, I would recommend that you go to Fenway Café (Brooklyne 61) where the brevages are cheaper than other places around that blocks."
I definitely recommend you to rent Sean's flat,"specially if you are looking for intimacy with your partner or simply not share the room with anyone else. A very good option for a greatest price.\"",,,,
3992208,53369081,2015-11-08,31334475,Leo,"This is a great place to for a quick stop over in Boston. The location is perfect being in the Fenway neighborhood. Lots of bars, restaurants, and public transportation stops close by. Sean was good with given instructions for checking in. The reviews here seems to be fairly accurate. Garbage truck wakes you up in the morning, the place is small with no TV, and if you don't follow instructions well you'll have some trouble with the check in process. If your expecting the Ritz, you'll be disappointed. If you are looking for a quick place to take a shower and bed to sleep in... Then this place is great. Sean makes himself available for any question you may have. I would definitely stay here again."
3992208,53826764,2015-11-13,45954378,David,We check in on 10 Nov and Out on 12 Nov.
On arrival we communicated via mobile to locate the keys. However,we were given the wrong number of the apartment after going up the 4th floor. After calling Sean,he then realized the apartment is on the ground floor. The location is great but the apartment is old and need a spring cleaning,The King/Queen mattress is also due to be replaced.,,

3992208,57513812,2015-12-27,45175054,Andrew,Sean's place was great. It was quite conveniently located and nice and cozy. It was just right for our quick visit to Boston.

pros:,,,,,
1. what you see is what you get. other than minor details,i knew exactly what this space would look like. it's not the lap of luxury,but that isn't what i paid for nor what i expected.,,,
2. cost. i couldn't find a hotel room,in a comparable location,for less than $180/night,,,
3. location. fenway is literally the next street over. many bars,restaurants,& other sights/attractions within walking distance,or using the easy access to mass transit. uber is an easy pickup in front. there is also a target,cvs,& grocery store within walking distance.
4. access. easy instructions to get the keys & i was thankful it was on the 1st floor,,,,,
5. communication. Sean was easy to contact,communicate with,& quickly responsive,,,
cons:,,,,,
1. noise. because of all of the bars nearby,there was a lot of late night / early morning foot traffic that was loud & obnoxious drunks. early morning trash pickup is very loud. unlike others,i didn't hear any neighbors,so that was nice.,,
2. wood slats under mattress move easily,resulting in spots that droop & are uncomfortable. we had to reset the slats a few times over the 9 days we were there. other than that,unlike what others have written,the mattresses were better than i expected.,,
3. towel racks would be nice,& more than one roll of toilet paper would've been appreciated.,,,,
4. the heat was overbearing. we actually had to keep the windows open,in the heart of winter,to combat the stifling heat.,,,
overall,i would jump at the chance to stay here again. the 4 cons were minor inconveniences compared to everything this place has to offer. having stayed as long as we did,"the angry reviews seem strange/petty & i question whether those folks actually looked at the description before they went.\"",,,
3992208,59374180,2016-01-10,34530215,Brittany,Great host and great place! The sheets needed to be changed but Sean came after I checked in to change the sheets and provide clean towels. Thanks for the hospitality :)
3992208,59854492,2016-01-16,8590773,Jeff,"Sean was quite helpful pointing out nearby (though scant) parking in advance, and the keybox instructions were very accurate. Unfortunately, we checked in via keybox before Sean had a chance to change sheets and tidy up so we encountered a small mess from the previous guests."
3992208,59899579,2016-01-17,35105918,Ryan,Sean's place got the job done for just spending the night for like 12 hours. Rigt next to Fenway/House of Blues and a bunch of fun stuff. It's no frills and inexpensive comparing it to what's around. Directions and communication to get in were clear and easy.
3992208,60284969,2016-01-21,50476892,Leonora,Easy to get keys from lockbox. Good communication
3992208,60373010,2016-01-22,36544084,Ariel,"I stayed here for one night and it was perfect. Great for one or two people but more than that could be a problem. It is located in the middle of the city which makes it easy to go anywhere. Although I didn't get to see Sean, he explained where the keys were and everything else perfectly. Would definitely stay here again :)"
3992208,60858064,2016-01-28,22419381,Gwendolyn,"Sean was very communicative, and checking in was easy and the place was very warm and toasty! Walking distance to all the things I needed--even a Trader Joe's! Like some other reviews said, it's an old building and somewhat spartanly furnished, but the bed was comfy and the experience was uneventful and safe. I would definitely recommend it and stay again if I am ever in Boston."

3992208,62355587,2016-02-14,23485641,Stacy,The location was awesome  - just a stone's throw to Fenway and the House of Blues.  The building was extremely quiet and the apartment was basic but clean and comfortable.  Sean was a good communicator and provided good directions on how to find the place and get access to the building.  The only hiccup was difficulty getting into the lock box (to return the key) - which may have been due to the cold.  I would stay here again.
3992208,63086410,2016-02-20,37175383,Congcong,It's a very convenient place to live.

The apartment basically just has a bed and a table, so don't plan on spending too much time inside!"
3992208,64065191,2016-02-29,17131746,John,"Sean was great, the instructions for arrival and departure were clear and concise. The apartment was perfect for me and 3 mates to bed down while visiting Boston for a long weekend. Great location, perfect accommodations."

3992208,65017768,2016-03-10,13937282,Pit,"The apartment was disappointing compared to the pictures, it was dark and old the kitchen is extremely small and the bathtub was clogged which was disguting. This came with a rude and arrogant Host which all made my worst airbnb experience."
3992208,65644507,2016-03-16,59981496,Asia,"This was a lovely experience overall. The apartment was located right near fenway, and it was clean and the kitchen was stocked with pots, pans, plates, glasses, silverware, and other helpful things."

I did not like the place, it was not comfortable the stay if you wanted to be in the department. The walls in our case were dark and poorly painted. The bed was very old and uncomfortable, definitely not sleep well. The neighborhood was cute and was well described."
Estuve en el departamento 4. El departamento estaba sucio,paredes en mal estado,la cama era muy incomoda,la ducha era fea y la cocina extremadamente chica. No me gusto el lugar,no fue comoda la estadia si querias estar en el departamento. Las paredes en nuestro caso estaban de oscuro y mal pintadas. La cama era muy vieja e incomoda,"definitivamente no dormiamos bien. El barrio era lindo y estuvo bien descripto.\""
3992208,66666706,2016-03-24,50536928,Phil,"Great location next to Fenway, easy walk into the centre of the city. Even after the apartment was 'cleaned' I had to scrub the tub and the windows and shower curtains were incredibly dirty."
3992208,66895679,2016-03-25,57554293,Paul,"Overall, we are not satisfied with this accommodation. We’d expect a lot more for the money we spent and would NOT recommend it!"
PRO:,,,,,
+ Good communication,friendly and fast responses,,,,
+ Keys were easy to find. Sean found a flexible solution so you don’t have to wait for the host to hand you the keys so you can arrive whenever you like.,,,,,
+ Location of the apartment was okay for us,we reached everything we wanted in little distance by bike or public transportation,,,,
+ Linings and towels were fresh and clean,,,,,
+ WiFi was good,,,,,
CONTRA:,,,,,
- LACK OF HYGIENE (insect killer in the kitchen and mouse traps in every room give you an idea),,,,,
everything we took out of the cabinets was greasy and DIRTY you don’t wanna cook there,the kitchen trash had not been taken out and smelled DISGUSTING,crumbs in the Toaster oven,old URINE stains on the toilet,bathtub has not been cleaned either,
- Also,you should be really close with your co-travellers,since you won’t be able to close the bathroom door all the way. There’s a screw missing (that could be fixed easily) and keeps the door hanging loose and scratching over the floor,,,
- Bathtub drain was clogged,,,,,
- You can clearly hear (and smell) the neighbors through the walls. I guess there a lot of young students living in this building. Don’t stay there if you like it quiet and private.,,,,,
"- All in all the apartment is anything but nice and cozy. The walls could really need some fresh paint and the floors a good scrub\"",,,,,
3992208,67370165,2016-03-29,45945324,Helen,"Seans place was in a good location for a weekend trip to a(EMAIL HIDDEN)munication with sean was easy and he replied to my messages pretty quickly. The place is a bit worn down due to the peeling paint and bathroom door not closing properly, however it was a pleasant stay."
3992208,68097895,2016-04-02,18968180,Neil,"The place is ok, a little shabby looking compared to the photos which is a pity because the location is good and it was clean. A tiny bit of work would turn this from an ok into a very good place to stay."
3992208,68671676,2016-04-06,45937174,Fernando,"Everything ran very smoothly. Sean was very attentive to every doubts we had (not many, actually). Location was fantastic."

3992208,69237291,2016-04-10,5289514,Beth,"Not sure what to say about this experience.  Cheap place, centrally located, but likely very unsanctioned, since you have to get the key from a lock box on a fence two doors down.  Old building, run down, paint peeling, water leaks everywhere in the bathroom when you shower.  No hair dryer (although Sean offered to bring one).  The view looks out on to a wall of graffiti and is located over the dumpster (which is an issue if you open the window and don't enjoy the smell of garbage). I've been lucky so far, but this was probably the worst air B & B place I have experienced."
3992208,70067161,2016-04-15,46465779,Josefina,Todo muy bien. Sean fue muy amable con nosotros. El departamento está muy bien ubicado y para una estadía corta en  Boston es perfecto!
3992208,70142733,2016-04-16,55015040,Jon & Jodie,Stayed one night - great location to go to Fenway Park.  Sean was quick to respond to questions and accommodated an early check in for us. Small space but ok for us for a place to spend one night.
3992208,70761766,2016-04-20,10142922,Rob,I did not meet Sean in person but his communications were excellent.
The key box worked well and access to the property was easy.,,,,,
I stayed in the apartment for the Boston marathon so the location was great but would also be perfect for Fenway Park or anything in the city centre.,,,,,
"On booking the apartment I was aware it was an older property and not in the luxury category however I was disappointed in the standard of cleaning and maintainance with a number of things not working properly.Indeed I left the apartment significantly cleaner than I found it.  With a small investment of time and money this property could be upgraded and be fantastic.\"",,,,,
3992208,72939143,2016-05-05,66977340,Connor,We definitely felt welcomed by this host. We appreciated the cleanliness of the apartment and his hospitality.
3992208,73520799,2016-05-08,40959371,Susan,"For the most part Sean responded promptly to emails.   The three strong points of the  apartment were its location, the fact that it was warm and the shower water pressure was very good.   The comforter was light and warm."

3992208,74817307,2016-05-16,46740164,Madeleine,Apartment was a bit old and run down but for the price and location it's perfect. Great for anyone looking to watch a game at Fenway park. Close to shops and restaurant to walk.
3992208,74946038,2016-05-17,58791316,Linda,The place is in a very good location and Sean is very prompt in getting back to you.
3992208,75203663,2016-05-19,45258603,Sharne,This apartment was close to public transport and also easy to get around places on foot.
It was a very basic place with limited facilities.,,,,,
When I arrived at check in time the apartment was not cleaned and it appeared that the bed was remade for me with the same bedcovers and pillow cases.,,,,,
The shower had excellent pressure but there was a lot of leaking water in the bathroom.,,,,,
"This place could be a great stop for 1 or 2 nights with some basic maintenance and improvement work and some more care to cleanliness and the guest experience.\"",,,,,
3992208,76113223,2016-05-24,53801998,Jane,"You're paying for the location, which is great. Getting access into the building and the apartment is rather a pain. Host does not provide instruction to access the place until you contact him. Host did not reply to airbnb messages. The place was extremely dusty and not clean."
3992208,77528512,2016-06-01,54141593,Santiago,"We only stayed at Sean's apartment for 1 night. The apartment is small but it was just what we needed,. We were there for two days and one night and most of the time we were out and about sightseeing. We just basically slept and shower and the apt, therefore we didn't mind it being small. The location was convenient and close the Fenway park (we definitely recommend the Fenway stadium tour) and close to the metro/train."
The apartment has a full kitchen but we didn't use it. The bed was okay,big enough for two people. And the room has an a/c unit. The apartment and bathroom were clean. However,we did see some silverfish bugs crawling in the room. But besides that the apartment was well kept just like in the pictures.,,,

3992208,78473789,2016-06-06,22615487,Nathan,Sean was very responsive to our messages and made us feel very welcome. He provided bottles of water for us in the fridge which were crucial since it was very warm the weekend we were there and weren't too familiar with the area yet.
If you're going to Fenway Park,"the location doesn't get much better than this. It's probably a 5-10 minute walk.\"",,,,
3992208,78608944,2016-06-07,55198612,Kayla,"Awesome apartment! Sean answered quickly and made everything very easy. Cute little stay, and very close to everything you might want or need in Boston. Thanks!!"
3992208,80199567,2016-06-16,55586871,Lisa,"It was a good location and ok for a one night stay, I personally wouldn't stay longer. The top mattress was a double and the queen was underneath, so we remade the bed on the bottom mattress as the top mattress was old and saggy. There was quite a bit of dust around the place, behind the heater etc..but for a one night stay it was ok. Great location to go to Fenway :)"
3992208,81191342,2016-06-21,42189072,Jody,"I have used airbnb enough to come to expect a certain level of cleanliness of the house and timeliness of the host.  This host was disappointing on both counts.  It was very difficult to communicate with the host.  It wasn't until I texted, emailed and called that I got directions for entry.  Upon our arrival, I had to locate the key away from the building in a lock box attached to a random chain link fence.  That was my first red flag.  Upon entry, the house was filthy.  Literal piles of dust and dirt in the corners, which may not be so bad under normal circumstances, but both beds were mattresses on the floor, so we we were up close and personal with the dirt.  There were not enough linens, or towels. There was only a fitted sheet and a duvet that was much too hot!  No top sheet or blankets.  No hand towels or wash cloths.  The shower had a pile of partially used soap.  No coffee maker or blender.  All of this was the second red flag.  The clincher was when I came home and found a letter from the landlord explaining that airbnb was not legal in the building.  By then, I was very uncomfortable.  When I asked the host about the letter, he dismissed it saying he gets letters like that all the time.  The location was great, and I did expect small and old (which is was), but dirty, illegal, and understocked - not good!"
3992208,81367506,2016-06-22,75450153,Charles,Very clean and great location to catch a game at Fenway.  Sean make everything very easy and was available although we did not need him.
3992208,81892171,2016-06-25,53816793,Bethany,This apartment was in such a good location. Just a few minute walk to the Kenmore station on the green line. Also a short walk to the Back Bay Area. Couldn't have asked for a better location. Sean was also very easy to communicate with and provided very clear instructions.
3992208,82485373,2016-06-27,31182192,Ashley,good location and room
3992208,82702702,2016-06-29,54905802,Melanie,Everything was as described
3992208,83006643,2016-06-30,5084977,Venktesh,"We were disappointed with this listing. I am from Boston and so am very familiar with the city, and my wife and I have stayed in AirBnBs across the world, so hopefully our comments will be helpful to other travelers."
We were most surprised at the lack of basic cleanliness of the studio apartment. Easily removable dust was along the walls,floors,under the bed,etc,and partially used soaps were scattered in the bathroom; meanwhile the presence of a mousetrap behind the bathtub made us fear the worst (luckily,we had no rodent surprises!). The one lamp in the bedroom did not work. We initially thought a cleaning had not been done prior to arrival
I was also surprised when I got a call a few hours later from another of the host's guests staying at a different property asking to switch keys. Not only had the host shared my contact information with this person without my permission,he also expected us to resolve the issue between ourselves,which took time away from my plans in Boston. Meanwhile,I'm still confused as to why one key is able to open 2 different buildings; the host offered no explanation. This seems like an important security issue.,,
Finally,I was surprised when I received the welcome note from the host stating that I should not mention to anyone that we were using AirBnB at this property (as he put it,"\"\"loose lips sink ships.\"\"). We were disappointed by this secrecy and would prefer staying in places that are legally sanctioned for AirBnB use.",,,
On the upside,we did appreciate that the host was flexible in our departure time,and for sure the location of the property,in the heart of Fenway,was very desirable.,
In re-reviewing the comments from other guests of this host,it seems clear that this host operates AirBnB at several properties (Fenway,Beacon Hill,other?) across the city,"so future potential guests should note that all listed comments likely do not apply to all properties. This review is for one of the properties in the Fenway area.\"",
3992208,84321313,2016-07-06,40252587,Georgie,Sean was very accommodating! We accidentally lost the keys and he was more then willing to assist us in getting new ones! (Again very sorry!) the apartment is in an ideal location and was perfect for the Fourth of July! Thanks for having us!
3992208,84681165,2016-07-08,28682130,Agnes,"Sean's appartment is really nice, and anything worth explaining was clearly explained in his arrival information. Thank you!"

Het was voor ons echt alleen een overnachtingsplek die goedkoper was dan alle hotels in de buurt.,,,,,
"We vonden 1 nacht echter wel genoeg. \"",,,,,
3992208,86412089,2016-07-16,70865409,Amy,"Sean was very helpful in communicating directions to us.  The apartment was in a very handy, safe location - close to Fenway, to restaurants, grocery store, Target, and the T.  We didn't use the kitchen, but it would have been helpful had our stay been longer. We appreciated the AC as well. Really a great deal."
3992208,87387081,2016-07-19,3285842,John,"We stayed here for 4 nights.  2 adults, 2 small kids.  The place was a bit older, but quite comfy and conveniently located to Fenway , the T, and many touristy spots.  Sean was a great host and communication was speedy.  I met him on check in and we chatted a little about the city and biking.  We had a little trouble with the front door key and Sean was quick to replace it.  We were close enough to Fenway to get a free fireworks show after a concert.  Great visit overall.  thanks sean!"
3992208,88253642,2016-07-23,46645494,Flor,"I had an excellent stay at Sean's place. I flew in to Boston from California because my San Francisco Giants were playing the Red Sox. What a perfect location! Fenway Park is virtually a few blocks away. There's a nice garden/park/trail across the street for a nice stroll. The Kenmore station is also nearby, which takes you anywhere in Boston. Sean's instructions were clear and finding the keys was easy. It was like a fun scavenger hunt to begin my adventure. The room is spacious for one person, but might be cramped for two. If there was such a thing as 1.5 person, it would be perfect. Basic stuff in the bathroom. I dig the bathtub. Kitchen is super small, but I really didn't spend that much time in there. I definitely recommend Sean's place for two people max."
3992208,88891227,2016-07-25,30216858,Stephen,"The location is absolutely perfect if you're planning to commute. Parking is difficult in the area, but Boston is notorious for their parking laws and restrictions. There are trains available very close by."
There are plenty of garages around the area that provide overnight parking.,,,,,
The neighborhood is nice and quiet. If you're looking to catch a Red Sox game,there is almost no better place to stay than Sean's. There are also a ton of great places to eat right around there. All in all,"Sean's place was cozy with access to food and fun. \"",,,

3992208,94685296,2016-08-16,47998084,Laura,Nice neighbourhood. Great location. Very close to Fenway park. Unfortunately retrieving the key from a lock box locked to a fence over a highway was not a great first impression. Secondly the key to the apartment blocks did not work and we were stranded outside at night. I tried to contact Sean but there was no answer. We ended up ringing another apartment to let us in. It meant we could not leave the apartment to go explore boston because we wouldn't be able to get back in. If the key worked it would have been an ideal apartment to stay in. However knowing you can leave your apartment and get back in is kind of important.

One of the best persons you would meet. Kind,generous,and extremely polite! Certainly it is wise to stay at his place,and will be a capital fault not to rent from him.

I felt very welcome and would stay with him any time again!"

4287366,22674418,2014-11-11,20702015,Stephanie,Courtney! Your place was beautiful and my cast was very pleased with their stay.  Thank you again for accommodating my special request.  The filming went swimmingly!
4287366,58209678,2016-01-01,51538116,Alison,Courtney was an excellent host. Her home was very lovely and she left a nice note on the counter for us. Thank you for your hospitality!
4287366,64834154,2016-03-08,18222896,Sarah,My business colleague and I stayed at Courtney's apartment for a conference taking place at the convention center. It was an easy $5-7 uber trip each way. The apartment was cozy and clean. Courtney had towels and toiletries waiting. My colleague and I were first timers so weren't sure what check out protocol was - like a hotel where you wouldn't strip the sheets or like staying at a relative's and yes we should strip the sheets. So a little guidance there would have helped so we didn't make an Airbnb faux pas. Overall a great experience though.
4287366,73613389,2016-05-09,17530066,Vanessa,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4287366,74457048,2016-05-15,33224631,Beans,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE
Courtney had cancelled our reservation a couple of days before the trip due to flooding in her apt - very understandable. The description of the work and floor did not seem as dangerous as it was. There were uneven,ripped up floors,ragged wood shards & exposed nails. There were building materials and ripped up carpeting in the living spaces. We were traveling with a 2 and 1/2 year old so this was very dangerous. We had to put blankets down to walk around.,,,
The main issue with the apartment was the cleanliness. Every appliance was dirty. Splattered food was in the freezer,refrigerator,microwave. Animal hair on the counters,"pubic hair in the bathroom. The toilet hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long. Grease/butter/filth smeared on all doors of appliances. We had to clean just to stay. Our son I believe dropped a chip on the floor and husband accidentally tripped on the floor and broke a glass. (which we will pay for). This is not a comfortable space when we stayed.  We are working now on a refund.\"",,
4287366,82278743,2016-06-27,58039199,Jenna,"Absolutely loved this apartment! The place was exactly as pictured. Everything was super clean, and the back porch was great! Courtney left out toiletries in the bedrooms and bathroom, and coffee for the morning. Couldn't have asked for a better stay!"
4287366,85161872,2016-07-10,67763626,Chrissy,"Courtney was very friendly and welcoming from the day of booking.  She made getting into the apt very easy, and when we had an issue with the key she was quick to call back and help resolve the issue.  The apartment was great, very nice neighborhood and within Uber distance of all the great sights in Boston and in walking distance of many great parks, restaurants and bars.  My dog loved the house too - very dog friendly!  Only issue was that the bathroom was a bit dirty upon check in."

8378257,51357172,2015-10-19,25103195,Larissa,"I had a wonderful time staying with Lorin in her adorable apartment. Her room is even bigger than it looks and very well kept. Plenty of hangers to hang up your clothes and lots of space if you're like me and tend to explode your suitcase the moment you walk in. The cats are sweet and cuddly and I wish I could take them home with me. The location is very safe and convenient to shops, restaurants and a few bars. I felt comfortable walking by myself at night to meet a friend. Lorin even accompanied me to dinner the second night, which I really appreciated  since I was traveling alone for work and was a total stress case. Overall it felt like I was staying with a great friend and she made everything super easy for me (even down to providing a handy welcome guide!)."
8378257,54519369,2015-11-21,4784834,Lauren,"I stayed at Lorin's place for almost two weeks and it was a wonderful experience! Lorin was very friendly and made sure that I was comfortable during the entire stay. The place was clean and the room was pretty, well-kept, and the bed was so comfortable. The location was in a good area, with a short walk to many different bus stops plus lots of cafes, restaurants, and bars. Their two cats were also very affectionate and sweet. I had a great time and would definitely recommend staying with Lorin!"

8378257,90305439,2016-07-31,6886321,Sara,"I was very excited for my stay here and it could not have been more of a disaster. It was not accurately represented in the listing. The home was very old and the space was not clean. The neighborhood was sketchy. This place would be possibly fine for someone in their teens or early 20s. After staying one night here, I was able to move out per approval by Airbnb. The girls then proceeded to send me a passive aggressive, rude text message after I had left. They thought I locked one of their cats in the attic...I didnt even know there was an attic and the only cat I ever saw was the one that wouldn't leave my bed. I was left on the streets with 3 bags in the rain on my first night in Boston because I just could not stay there any longer. Cat food on the floor, a mess in the sink and in fridge...dirty dishes, dirty spoons laying around with cat food on them. The bedroom was riddled with photos of random girls. I felt like I was sharing a room with someone else. The home was old and dark and seemed to be a large house divided up so many times that there were possibly dozens of people under one roof. When I arrived, there were about 6 boys in their early 20s drinking topless outside the door. Felt like a frat party. Also this unit has a shared bathroom thats not near your bedroom, and your bedroom would be right in the living room. Very small space. The girls were out of town when I arrived and did not leave me with the internet code or any information but one towel full of cat hair on it. On the other side of the bed, there were pillows and things just thrown on the floor. Its like they didn't even clean the room. I paid a couple hundred more and found a much better place for me.... with no childish behavior from the host. Pains me to write this review as a fellow host myself but I would not want anyone else to be fooled into staying here."

They left detailed instructions for our stay, answered any questions we had,  and even left 2 bottles of wine for us to enjoy with our holiday dinners; such a thoughtful touch! They were just awesome; they kept in touch (via text messaging) to make sure that we were enjoying our stay and let us know they were available to immediately address any issue that may arise. The apartment was even better in person - super cute, clean, and comfy! It was also bigger than we thought it would be, with enough room for the 3 of us (me, my husband, and our adult son) to spend time together, but also for each of us to have our own space if desired. The apt had all the described amenities (2 flat-screen TVs, wireless internet, a fully-supplied kitchen, etc.). We all slept well; the beds were big, soft, and warm. The neighborhood was nice, very quiet with a suburban feel. This was our first experience with airbnb, and the bar has been set very high indeed! This was sooo much better than staying in a hotel. The apartment was absolutely perfect - literally a home away from home. We would stay there again in a heartbeat."

The sights of Boston itself were all within easy reach by public transport and we made full use of our 7 day travel pass. Fabulous value!

Every room and everything in the house is exactly what is in the pictures….if not better. The house was immaculate and there was a great abundance of towels, a couple robes, and slippers. The only bad part of staying here, is that it totally raised our standards and knew this would be tough to beat. Our next stop was NY and the house we are staying in now is no where close to the Allston house. I would go back to Boston just to stay at their house again!"

Parking is a little hard to come by in the area (there are a lot of spaces on the neighbourhood streets, but also a lot of cars, especially at night), but that's par for the course in Boston, so that's not really a strike against the place. Richard was very good about maintaining contact, though all the instructions were pretty clear so I didn't really have to reach out to him often."

Cons: 1. Have to live with 2 other renters,who might not be as tidy as you expected. Therefore,common places (bathroom,"kitchen and living room) can be messy and even dirty. 2. You definitely have to be aware of what's around you between the subway station and the apartment even though this place is on much safer side the Dorchester. \"",,

Location is great in terms of commuting to downtown, with grocery store nearby, safe and quiet neighborhood. Nathan is a polite landlord, he kindly let me check out a few hours late. One  caveat is that the apartment is not so clean -doors and walls of bathroom and kitchen apart from the floors need to be cleaned up. The bed and sheets, and the room I had  were all clean, though. I shared the apartment with two other roommates both were nice graduate students and busy with their internship."

11986653,73102744,2016-05-06,42982369,Shota,Super free space and nice host! I'll cone back here someday.
11986653,73886946,2016-05-11,27616913,Wee Leen,The toilet pretty clean and good location! The only think that I don't like is the door couldn't close well and the room quite dirty.
11986653,74704643,2016-05-16,27922445,Osama,James a very cool laid back guy i enjoyed my stay! Hospitality was a1

11986653,75969478,2016-05-23,58908207,Mariana,James' place was just what we need. Confortable and clean. Very nice and people!
11986653,76516978,2016-05-27,69325098,Katie,Place looked nothing like what is portrayed in the picture. It was basically like a government owned social housing scheme in a very ruined down area. Along with this it was extremely dirty and had no privacy as the door cannot be locked and is in fact just a plank of wood and there was a girl living in the other bedroom in the flat. The toilet was like something you would see in a prison cell and the kitchen area consisted of 1 cupboard and a sink .
Myself and boyfriend didn't stay one night and had to find a hostel in Boston city. When we said it to the landlord he didn't seem to be bothered and just denied that the property had any faults and didn't offer any kind of compensation.,,,,,
"I wouldn't advise any person to take up this accommodation as you will be highly disgusted. I also have pictures of what the accommodation actually looks like if you would like to see them just contact me.\"",,,,,
11986653,77000113,2016-05-30,50141248,Fabien,James gave us a key and let us unpacking quietly. It was nice.

11986653,78177356,2016-06-05,67913095,Ravneet,He was very welcoming and picked us up from the subway station. He also made sure that we had everything we needed to make us comfortable during our stay.
11986653,78587147,2016-06-07,66408787,Andrii,"Location is very good. It is very close to the beach and subway, five minutes walk. There are some stations from the centre of Boston. Arrival time is flexible. It's very good."
James is kind,intelligent and very hospitable person. When we rent a car and didn't find parking he helped us with this problem. It's one of some problems we faced to and James always helped us.,,,,
"We recommend James' place.\"",,,,,
11986653,80494637,2016-06-18,70135486,Scott,"\"James was a fantastic host.  Very laid back.  Wasn't too in your business.  Didn't have very strict \"\"time-in\"\" requirements.  He was just a very chill dude with a very convenient South Boston location that you can walk to pretty much anywhere from"
11986653,81427531,2016-06-23,61590903,Xueying,"James is really a nice guy. His house is close to the subway station so it's really convenient. But the room door can't be locked. If you don't mind it, his house would be your smart choice."
11986653,82339300,2016-06-27,68019650,Lena,Wir hatten Schöne tage direkt am strand. Die Anbindung zur Innenstadt War super und James War ein guter Gastgeber.  Für wenige Tage ist das Zimmer ausreichend.
11986653,83050130,2016-07-01,72868056,Rohan,James is a good host and a nice guy. This was my first ever time AirBnB-ing but it was effortless. He got us the keys and left us to ourselves.
As described,the place is well located,near a station,and near the beach! It has a really good shower,clean towels,the bedroom has AC
We did also have a cockroach,and the door to the room doesn't really shut let alone lock,also the beds didn't feel particularly clean or comfortable. But to be honest most of that kind of stuff just comes from the fact it's a real old building in a well lived in estate.,,,
Just putting this here to be totally honest.,,,,,
"Would recommend!\"",,,,,
11986653,83351445,2016-07-02,2493811,Maryellen,"James did a great job of communicating with my friends (there were four of us who arrived at two different times). The location was cozy with all of us, James estimation of the space being three comfortable, four if you're close, is accurate. :) So is his description of the neighborhood. For us it was very convenient, a short walk to the train station with all of our luggage (and a short run on the night that it rained!).  It was perfect for my friends and I to meet up and continue on the next leg of our adventure!"
11986653,83541376,2016-07-03,57106072,Yahsin,"James is a really nice person, easy-going. The location of apartment is great, and the neighborhood is clean and quiet. I will definitely recommend this place!"

11986653,85370429,2016-07-11,10457168,Mohamed,"James has been an amazing host. He was punctual, helpful, social and kind. He responded quickly to my questions whenever I needed help or tips about Boston (even after my stay) and we had good talks about life. Accommodation had everything that my colleague and I required. The neighborhood was quiet and outside the city center but since the subway (redline) is 1 minute walk away, you'll reach South Station in 10 minutes."
"I highly recommend this place! \"",,,,,
11986653,86696156,2016-07-17,70651134,Chukwudi,"\"James is a gentleman. His unassuming, down-to-earth, and honest personality were his selling points. He is open-minded and willing to explore divergent views. His description of his listing as \"\"sufficient\"\" was accurate. He humbly accepted all improvement suggestions for his listing. He was quick to attend to my needs"
11986653,87312684,2016-07-19,73336199,Amit,"This place is a hidden gem! If you are really interested in experiencing real Boston neighborhood, there is no better place than this one. Easily accessible via JFK/UMass station of T-line, as well as conveniently near the calmness of the beach! We truly enjoyed our stay with James. He offered us plenty of useful insights to help us experience Boston better. I give five-stars and a thumbs-up to this listing."
PS - I almost forgot about this. If you are in this room,"do take time to appreciate the art behind James' paintings. What an amazing artist!  \"",,,,
11986653,87870651,2016-07-22,65001947,Jérémy,"Super accueil avec des fruits frais. La chambre est fidèle à la description. Le quartier est bien, juste a côté de la plage et du métro. Nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion d'échanger beaucoup, mais les occupants étaient très sympa."
11986653,88361249,2016-07-24,74116925,Didier,"James is a great host.  El respondió los mensajes inmediatamente, fue muy atento y cordial.  Fue muy flexible con la hora de entrada que tuvimos algún retraso con respecto a la hora fijada.  James es una persona muy amistosa y cordial.  La ubicación a 150 metros de la línea roja del metro, mejor no se puede. La próxima vez en Boston espero hospedarme de nuevo en el apartamento de James."
11986653,89513625,2016-07-28,38060582,Florent,"Appartement similaire à la présentation, très proche de la plage et du métro.  James est arrangeant même si nous n'avons pas pu échanger beaucoup."
11986653,91535536,2016-08-05,5041717,Marianne,"Pros: not expensive considering Cost of living in Boston, easy to park a car nearby, we haven't seen James very much but his friend who helped him, Shawna, was wonderful with us. She even cooked os some delicious ribs and helped us find a good mecanic for our car, home is nearby a subway and a hubay station as well as a grocery, the room was according to the description and picture, but dirtier. We communicated easlily with James during the location as well as before."
Cons: the house was not clean,the biggest problem was the missing door: the room door was a wardrob door that couldn't even cover the door space,giving us absolutly no intimity,the description says theie is an included breakfast but it is a bit much to say since it was a large box of pieces of fruit,"already old. You should know that the district is a bit odd but it is to be expected considering the location on the map and the price. \"",
11986653,92886848,2016-08-10,14726838,Thalia,Had a good stay at James' place. Place is exactly as described. Jame is a great host. We arrived early in the morning and he let us come drop our bags of and freshen up before the room was ready. Thanks for the stay.

11986653,96818479,2016-08-24,24255938,Lukas,James' partner welcomed us and showed us the room (two beds). It was really cozy and the big TV was great. Just a couple of minutes away from the beach and from JFK station with regular subway service to downtown.
"We had to call James two times before arrival and he always answered our calls right away. I can really recommend staying there.\"",,,,,
11986653,97473770,2016-08-27,84324611,Siriwan,The room is unexpectedly small. The missing door need to be fixed. The room was not that clean but the host is really nice. When I told him I will be arrived at 3.00 am he said I can come in immediately and stayed awake until I came and showed me the room. The location is really great. It took like 3 minutes walking to sub way.
11986653,97777443,2016-08-28,83848719,Jessica,Stayed just for a few hours before catching a red eye flight back home. James was very quick with responses. We never got to meet him but Shawna was there to open the door. The neighborhood is not what I was expecting but we had no problems finding it. The room was a simple one bedroom. No door though in case your looking for complete privacy. They use a curtain. Was about 20 mins away from Quincy market. Good enough to stay for our purpose.
14467554,96362352,2016-08-22,11307072,Jenny,"Cozy converted 3 ba 1 ba at west end area of Boston.  The decoration makes us feel fresh and bright, and it is close to piers, Cambridge as we ulber everywhere and it took within 15 min for every drive. In addition,  Elizabeth is  considerate and always provides first time response upon my question!  Will definitely recommend it to friends and stay at this apartment for our next trip to Boston."

Longer Review: Before we arrived,Lisa was great with communication. She responded quickly (we had to book pretty close to the date) and she was able to get us in very fast. She was really sweet too by letting us check in a little early. When we arrived,there was amble free street parking and we noticed it was very VERY close to the T (only a 5-10 minute walk).,,,
Inside,the home is beautiful and very clean. The bed was sooooo comfy and the room provided us with everything we needed. Lisa was extremely friendly and helpful with getting around Boston. We had brought food with us,and being able to use the kitchen was awesome! They let us store food in the fridge and we made sure to clean everything we used.,,,
We even hung out with Lisa and Brian (her husband) a bit!,,,,,
Overall,"I'd say book here... Immediately. :) We plan on staying with them any time we return to Boston!\"",,,,
3988018,19451585,2014-09-12,20949372,Anthony,The neighbourhood was great. Easy access to train (with metro pass provided) and on the border between two interesting areas. Felt very safe and cozy. Lisa met us when we arrived and the place was really clean and everything was provided including breakfast. It was very nice.

3988018,19809440,2014-09-18,3180490,Elizabeth & Kenji,"Wow what a great place to stay. Lisa is an awesome host both available & unobtrusive. The place is clean, comfortable and a GREAT VALUE. When I first looked at the listing I did not realize it comes with breakfast & subway/metro/train tickets for two people per room for no extra charge. And it is only a couple minutes walk to the subway/metro/train so we were in downtown Boston about 25 minutes after we walked out of her apartment building. My husband & I have stayed in a lot of Airbnb places and Lisa's was really great. Thanks!!!"
3988018,19972447,2014-09-21,20947364,Chris,"Lisa was a very welcoming hostess. The room was just as we expected, clean and with all facilities as described. It was a great base for spending a few days in a quieter part of Boston. Also, the home-baked cookies were really delicious! The travel passes are really handy - I definitely recommend a stay here."
3988018,20260426,2014-09-26,21381461,Jen,"Lisa is a warm, welcoming host who clearly cares about her guests and wants them to have a great time in Boston. It is a great value considering the  quality of the accommodation and the location. This is a great place to stay if you enjoy meeting other travellers. There is a shared kitchen and common area which is very pleasant. The neighbourhood seems great and we enjoyed a few of the local pubs. Thanks again Lisa!"

However, Lisa was so welcoming and took the time to show us through the house and explain everything we may need.  The room was perfect. So clean and tidy, chocolates and fresh towels, soft sheets, home baked cookies and snacks in the room. Their home is beautiful and we really were made to feel very welcome. There was plenty of brochures on Boston attractions and takeaway menus etc. Lisa was very helpful in offering advice on places to eat, things to see and the best way to get around. The complimentary travel cards they provided us were great, it meant we could enjoy the city without the hassle of organising that. The entire house was spotless, we couldn't fault a thing. It's close to the train station and a bus stop right outside was so convenient. Lisa also provides a breakfast each day which is just lovely. Fresh muffins, fruit, bagels, cereal, oatmeal, juice etc and a great little coffee machine which was SO GOOD!! The entire place was spotless, the bathroom even had a night light so you can find your way in the evening, a really nice touch. Overall, we couldn't fault a thing. We would have loved to stay longer. I'd would definitely recommend staying here."

Very flexible about check-in and check-out, we could also use the free subway-pass until night time although we checked out early! Thanks for that! And there is free parking on the street and the subway is not far away, so it is easy to get to the city center! Very helpful hosts and recommendable to everyone :)"

3988018,21440351,2014-10-17,22169568,Christian,"Ich kann mich den vorherigen Bewertungen nur anschließen. Lisa war eine hervorragende Gastgeberin, meine späte Ankunft überhaupt kein Problem, ich wurde willkommen geheißen und noch durch die Wohnung geführt, auf dem Zimmer warteten dann warme Cookies und Snacks. Für meinen Aufenthalt in Boston hatte sie viele hilfreiche Tipps für mich und hat bei Bedarf auch mit Kartenmaterial ausgeholfen. Als ich spontan Besuch durch einen Freund erhielt und Lisa davon erzählt hatte, stand abends, ohne dass es explizit abgesprochen war, ein Feldbett vor meinem Zimmer. Ich habe mich während meines Aufenthalts rundum versorgt gefühlt, wenn etwas fehlte, konnte ich Lisa immer schnell erreichen und Probleme beheben, bevor sie wirklich aufkamen. Das Zimmer entsprach der Beschreibung, die gesamte Wohnung ist sehr gemütlich und kann von den Gästen auf zwei Etagen mitgenutzt werden. Ich kann einen Aufenthalt bei Lisa und Brian wärmstens empfehlen und würde jederzeit wieder dort buchen, wenn es mich erneut nach Boston verschlägt."

3988018,27522284,2015-03-06,899628,Delio,My girlfriend and I had not used AirBnB before. Lisa and her husband ensured that our first time would not be our last. I've used CouchSurfing and conventional lodging (hotels and the like) AirBnB was the best of both! Lisa responded to every question we had within minutes (seconds in some cases) which was amazing. I really couldn't find anything at all to complain about if you paid me to. Perfect!
3988018,27683330,2015-03-09,28121718,Seyi,Hospitality at its finest! Location is phenomenal for public transportation along with the use of the transportation passes.  Lodging met all expectations as described.  Truly enjoyed the stay along with the thorough and well thought out instructions and summary of places to visit during the stay. The communication was exceptional and truly appreciated at every step of my trip. I will definitely be looking to stay again the future!

They’ll go out of their way to make sure you and all their other guests feel comfortable and welcome. I have a weakness for both Cheez-Its and gummy bears, and there were two snack size bags of each of them waiting for me in my room. The room was nice and clean. The bed was simple but comfortable. The shower and bathroom got the job done. And it’s close to the ice cream wholesaler!"

3988018,29853147,2015-04-13,29336019,Martha,"Everything worked out very well.  The room was comfortable and the owners were great.  We had a good time chatting with Lisa & Matt and some of the other guests, although we were mostly away to watch the college hockey finals.  The close proximity to the subway system and the free subway cards that were part of the room deal were great for getting around.  The short bus ride wasn't a problem, and we felt very safe taking the short walk late at night when buses weren't frequent."
3988018,30060982,2015-04-16,900550,Angie,"Lisa and Brian were great hosts who really take pride in providing the best service possible for all guests!  It was clean, comfy, and pleasant. Also, there are so many great amenities at their house that really takes the stay to the next level. (Especially the T passes!) The area is also conveniently near public transportation that can take you all around Boston very easily.  We enjoyed our stay!"
3988018,30117377,2015-04-17,7849077,Shirley,"A great stay with amazing, accommodating and kind hosts. Thanks so much!"
3988018,30157506,2015-04-18,20230483,Adrien,"Thank you so much Lisa! We had a most pleasant stay at your house. Everything was great, and even though the house is not in downtown, it's really easy to access with the subway and the busses! Definitely recommand."
3988018,30310052,2015-04-20,22198915,Darri,"Our first AirBNB experience and it truly exceeded our expectations! Five stars without a question. The Sports Room was really comfy, we loved the Subway passes and I could've spent the entire time in the TV room. At first the neighbourhood seems to be a bit far from downtown Boston but in about one day, when you've figured out the transportation system, it's so easy. The bus literally stops right in front of the house. Lisa is obviously an ambitious host and I would definitely recommend staying here! Thanks!"
3988018,30567121,2015-04-24,12566043,Patricia,"Lisa made us feel very welcome from the moment we got there. She allowed us to leave our bags before check in time and after check out time wich was really convenient. The snacks and bottle water left in the room was a nice gesture we greatly appreciated. The T passes a plus. The room was exactly like the picture, very clean and comfortable. Kitchen and bathroom spacious and clean. We did not have a chance to enjoy the rest of the house as we were out from early morning to late at night touring the city. Lisa was attentive to our needs and very helpful."
The Arnold arboretum was a pleasant experience,conveniently located and with a fascinating view of the city.,,,,
We loved our stay and would do it again and recommend it to family and friends.,,,,,
"Thanks again Lisa.\"",,,,,
3988018,30628135,2015-04-25,30484688,Ronald,Absolutely awesome first airbnb experience. Thanks to Lisa for the hospitality! I will stay at Lisa's every time I head up to Boston now!
3988018,30843728,2015-04-27,24008482,Georgina,"Lisa was a wonderful host. Breakfast, unlimited train tickets, Lisa's hospitality and the location were the best parts about it! 30 min to downtown Boston, her house is literally a couple blocks to the Forest Hills train station which is extremely convenient! airbnb-ed a couple times now, and this experience was hands-down the best one yet. Would definitely love to be back!!"
You'll love Lisa & her pet bearded dragon (who's harmless & super chill!) Kaiju. And this is coming from someone who's afraid of reptiles.,,,,,
P.s. Thanks Lisa,"Natalia & I had a wonderful time. Hit us up when you come to New York!\"",,,,
3988018,30963195,2015-04-29,28324542,Eva,"Staying at Lisa's was perfect, everything even better then described. You can have anything you can think of for breakfast, everything was arranged. We only wish we could have stayed longer!"

3988018,31436712,2015-05-05,28788172,Lyne,"Lisa and Brian were amazing hosts. They went above and beyond what they were contracted to do. The place was clean, comfortable, and cozy. We had full access to the kitchen and even the washer and dryer. They gave us great ideas on what to do and where to go. The bus/subway pass they gave us was so helpful and welcome. And the fact that they are for California gave us something to talk about right away. They made our trip really memorable and we would definitely stay with them again."
3988018,31681253,2015-05-08,32541867,Paul,"This was our first airbnb experience, and it was truly awesome, as were our hosts, Lisa and Brian. They made us feel very much at home without being in any way intrusive. The beds were comfortable, the coffee was good (very important!), and the free Charlie passes (which gave us three days of free bus and subway rides on Boston's public transit system) were an amazing bonus. Lisa also provided great recommendations about things to do and see, and places to eat, and went out of her way to draw us a walking route through Harvard's arboretum, which is very close by. Parking is on the street but was no problem at all, even when we got in after 11 pm. Everything was clean and fresh, and the price is so right--less than half of what the nearest Red Roof Inn out on the Mass Pike charges, and a whole heck of a lot better! Very highly recommended!"
3988018,31736153,2015-05-09,16543928,Tammy,Lisa is really nice and helpful. We have clean room and free subway cards. It's a lovely house.
3988018,32140138,2015-05-14,32192549,Lisa,"My Host made me feel very welcomed. Easy kitchen, to share. House rules, were  simple to follow. Modest accommodations, however, close to the Faulkner Hospital (15 minutes) by car, or within, walking distance. My room had air-conditioning, television, a desk and the bed was comfortable."

3988018,32973506,2015-05-24,29577622,Jean-François,We had a great week end at the Sport Room! We were welcome very well. Everything was clean and there were lots of facilities. The bus and train pass was very usefull.
I highly recommend the place.,,,,,
"Nous avons été très bien reçus à la Sport Room. C'était très propre et il y avait plusieurs commodités. La passe de métro fut particulièrement bienvenue. \"",,,,,
3988018,33149376,2015-05-25,32017319,Karen,"It was such a great experience I had in Boston! Lisa is very welcoming and easy going. She set up a portable bed to accommodate three of us as my parents were traveling with me. She is very considerate and texted me in advance asking me if my parents have food allergies so that she can prepare breakfast for us. We arrived late due to traffic issue, but Lisa was very patient and stayed up late waiting for us. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND people stay with Lisa."
3988018,33513136,2015-05-29,31392299,Barry,Lisa was great and available for any assistance needed. The location is easy for public transport. My first Airbnb experience and I'm sold!
3988018,34010433,2015-06-03,23692390,Amy,"he sports room was a great inexpensive option for us. The beds were comfortable and room big enough to accommodate both of us and our luggage fairly comfortably. Room was very clean. Aircon and heating worked well (weirdly, we needed both!!). Parking wasn't too hard, even my parallel parking phobic husband was able to get drive in spots without too much of a bother. The Charlie cards were a huge bonus, and given the house is literally at a bus stop, and a very short walk to the Orange line, we used them all the time. Very easy to get into the city- most of the main stops are on the one line, and because the house is on the last stop, it's simple getting home too. The shower is lovely and super hot, and kitchen had all the basic cooking gear you needed for a night in. Wifi was very quick and we never had any issues with dropping in or out. It is more of a boarding house than description suggests- apart from a private section out back, all the other rooms (two floors in one house) are guest rooms, which was a little disconcerting for boarding newbies like us. Still, there are two bathrooms and we only really had to wait a few times in the mornings. Overall, given the price of hotels, and taking in account the massive saving of the free charlie card, this was a fantastic value option and one I would recommend as long as you are okay sharing your space!"
3988018,34207006,2015-06-06,31307566,Gloria,My parents loved the stay. Room and bathroom were clean. Having a subway nearby really made the stay convenient for my parents. Definitely would recommend!
3988018,34624773,2015-06-10,29040573,Katharina,"If you ever go to Boston, I recommend you stay in this Airbnb! The room was as listed, the metro cards came in handy, the hosts were extremely helpful and friendly, and most importantly: Whatever little extra-wishes we had, Lisa made them all come true! ;-)"

3988018,34829912,2015-06-12,35241037,Lishi,Lisa is sweet and helpful. And the place is convenient to Boston. The room is clean and enough for two person. There are a lot of choice for breakfast! Great value!

3988018,35429444,2015-06-18,28359279,Amy,"Just like home.  Lisa and Brian make their space your place.  Lisa is available and helpful for everything! Transit passes made our travels to the Freedom Trail and Harvard a breeze.  We enjoyed the COOP on the way to the train station for Kambucha refills and treats.  Neighborhood is nice.  Cereal and toasts, and fruit etc...available for b-fast or in our case an evening night cap. Arboretum behind house is a great cut through."
We don't watch TV much at home,therefore a nice treat to be able to enjoy shows I never watch at home esp,"after walking 10 miles each day!    All and all a great space.\"",,,
3988018,35559378,2015-06-20,32207340,Mac,"Lisa was very responsive via text messaging, and made us feel welcome upon our arrival.  The double room was as expected, and has its own AC unit, which was really nice on 2 warm June nights."
The excellent values here are 1) the breakfast provided,with coffee,juice,eggs that you can cook,etc.; and 2) two Metro passes provided with the room,which we used a lot.
"Great visit to Boston.\"",,,,,
3988018,35829871,2015-06-22,23102531,Andrea,We had a great weekend in the accommodation of Lisa and Brian. We were welcome very well. They made their home to our place. Everything you needed was there if it was for cooking or information avout boston e.c. My friend didn't have an umbrella so lisa borrowed him one. The room was very clean and we got some free snacks as welcome-gift. The location is easy located to the public transport. The free public transport passes were a nice extra and very useful for make sightseeing in Boston. The Wifi worked very quick and we didn't have problems with the connection. The breakfast was great a lot of choices. It was my first airbnb-experience and i would totally recommand to stay by Lisa and Brian.
3988018,35993597,2015-06-23,25471581,Lorenzo,Lisa was awesome as a host. Both her and Brian made our short stay very welcoming. The rooms were very clean and was well stocked. It even had a white noise machine!!!
3988018,36129801,2015-06-25,35359524,Konstantinos,A vary convenient room both in terms of its amenities but also in terms of its location. Hospitality was suburb. Hosts were always available to help.
3988018,36516919,2015-06-29,30324351,Shelley,We couldn't have been happier with our first Airbnb experience! Lisa was the perfect hostess and did everything she could to answer any questions we had to make our first trip to Boston amazing. The room and house are simple and cozy and what a treat to have fresh baked cookies when we arrived! The kitchen was well stocked and having the bus/train passes available for our use were priceless and took away the stress of trying to drive in a new city. We felt like we were staying with friends and when we come back to Boston we will definitely be booking with Lisa and Brian again!
3988018,36752768,2015-06-30,37082751,Daniel,Lisa was great. My brother and I were very comfortable staying in Lisa's home. The two unlimited train and bus passes were a major help to get to Boston and back. I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in town again.
3988018,36907986,2015-07-02,22476731,Diane,Très bien accueillie. Lisa fait tout son possible pour que le séjour soit agréable. Autobus en face et passe de métro un plus.

Cookies upon arrival, breakfast, snacks, games, movies, recommendations on what to do in Boston, transit passes, and the cleanest (URL HIDDEN) detail went unnoticed.  We loved exploring Boston and having such a pleasant place to return to each evening.  Highly recommend! Five stars!"

The space looked and felt exactly as described and was clean and comfortable, which were important to me as a first time airbnb user.  The hosts paid attention to small thoughtful details in each of the guest rooms and the shared bathroom and kitchen that made sure it felt like home and gave great value for the price.  Including the free subway passes. Getting to downtown was only 25 mins door to door and very easy with frequent bus connections right in front their door. Loved having my own tv in the Sports room. Just like a hotel room but cosier.  Air conditioning was great during the hot and humid Boston weather.  Would definitely stay here again if back in Boston."

They go above and beyond to make your stay the best possible. The beds are extremely comfortable, there is AC and a big TV in the room. The room is very clean and they even leave Lindt Truffles on the towels as well as snacks on the desk. To make your stay even better they have unlimited Charlie Cards that guests can use for no extra charge (a big money saver and very convenient)! The location is amazing because a bus stop is right across the street and that takes you to the Forest Hills Train Station down the road (on foot it is around a 10 minute walk) giving you access to the entire Boston area. There is breakfast available every morning. They are so considerate as to even put a shampoo and conditioner dispenser in the shower if you forget yours at home. Their place has a very homey atmosphere and I highly recommend it to anyone staying in Boston. It was truly a pleasure to stay there."

Everything was ready when we came, she gave us a tour of the apartment, and had fresh chocolate chip cookies and snacks waiting in our room upon arrival! She also gave us a list of places her husband and her recommend. The Charlie cards were a great addition and we used them several times while we were there to go down town on the T.

Free CharilieCard really brings us convenience. The traffic here is pretty convenient and easy to remember, any buses can direct the T station, pretty easy for the downtown. What's more, as a freshman, to begin a new life in the new country is confusing, but Lisa really helps me a lot! If my friends coming to Boston next summer, I'll definately recommend them to stay here! ~"
3988018,45641210,2015-09-04,29280026,Luise,I booked Lisa's apartment for my brother and cousin visiting me from Germany. Although they just stayed over for one night they felt really comfortable. How Lisa cares as a host is really honorable.
The room was nice and clean and exactly how it's shown in the pictures. What's awesome as well is the opportunity for breakfast. The only thing is that it tends to be kind of loud in the house,"but Lisa bought a \"\"noise maker\"\"",which is really cool.,,,
I can highly recommend this room for every age and the public transportation is amazing as well.,,,,,
For german visitors: Ich bin ein deutsches Au Pair in Amerika und hatte meinen Bruder und meine Cousine zu Besuch. Lisa als host ist extrem hilfsbereit und immer erreichbar,zu dem ist sie auch flexibel was das einchecken angeht. Das Zimmer ist genauso wie auf dem Foto,sehr sauber und gemütlich. Das Frühstück bietet alles was man braucht und auch die sanitären Anlagen sind sauber. In der Nacht kann es sein,dass es ein wenig lauter wird im Haus,"aber das ist nicht immer der Fall.

3988018,48799718,2015-09-28,37684677,Daniel,"Lisa was an excellent host. She was waiting for us when we arrived to welcome us and show us around her property. The apartment is conveniently located across from a bus stop and about a 10 minute walk from the train station (orange line). Overall, I couldn't have been happier to stay here."
3988018,49610563,2015-10-05,39226836,Elsa,Lisa has made my first bnb experience joyfully. The house is not far from the subway station and I can always find seat on train since forest hill is the start of orange line. Lisa is very organized and will always happy to offer suggestions.
We also enjoyed the cookies made by Lisa. Very yummy!,,,,,
Kanju is such a quiet roommate and we have been the audience to learn how he takes the breakfast.,,,,,

3988018,49965696,2015-10-07,44723115,Ben,We really enjoyed our stay at Lisa's house. She was very friendly and assisted us with any queries we had. She was very informative about things to do in Boston and our visit went a lot smoother because of it. The free travel passes made our stay much more hassle free and were a very nice touch from Lisa!
3988018,50123297,2015-10-09,44704207,Freydís,"Lisa made us feel very welcome when we arrived and during the stay. She was around so we were able to ask her questions and get further information about Boston. The neighbourhood was nice amd quiet, very accessable by public transport. The free passes were a huge plus. Highly recommend this option!"
3988018,50325097,2015-10-11,39759724,Jenny,"Lisa and Brian were delightful and engaging hosts. The little gestures like freshly-baked cookies on arrival, lots of free maps and guides and the movie screening room with free popcorn really made us feel like valued guests. The breakfast is also fantastic. The house is in a bohemian neighbourhood with interesting restaurants, and though there were other guests it never felt busy or crowded. I'd definitely stay again!"
3988018,50695889,2015-10-13,19203066,Ralph,"Lisa was exceptionally helpful and welcoming - I couldn't ask for more from an Airbnb stay.  Good provision of food for breakfast and snacks, with drinks available any time.  Convenient for getting into Boston on the Orange Line with multiple buses stopping at the front door."

3988018,51142167,2015-10-18,17882867,Rick,LIsa was most friendly and welcoming.  The accommodations are as described.  I found the bed to be very comfortable and the setting relaxed.  I liked having kitchen privileges and there is a food and drink available to guests around the clock.  Very convenient to public transportation and I was able to park right in front of the house.
3988018,51777419,2015-10-24,45618659,Ashleigh,Thanks for a great stay!

"We had a great night there! \"",,,,,
3988018,53194561,2015-11-06,12052490,Giselle,"\"Lisa provided everything you could think of - and not think of! There were so many extra touches in the room that were a pleasant surprise: water and snacks, ear plugs, a desk and writing utensils, a white noise maker, shelves, and universal phone charger! The included train/bus passes were a super nice amenity as well. It seems the \"\"breakfast\"\" part of bed and breakfasts are often left out of AirBnbs"
"We loved the walk around the Arnold Arboretum that was right behind the apartment.  It was also a convenient spot near the end of the orange line.  \"",,,,,
3988018,53282704,2015-11-07,47432153,Heidi,"We had the greatest experience staying at this Airbnb. My son and I needed a place to stay so he could attend a college tour. Lisa made us feel welcome immediately, spending time telling us about places to explore in the city, and how the subway system works (it's a 10 minute walk and then a 20 minute trip into the city center - Lisa provided the passes). She also provided a great make-it-yourself breakfast and plenty of snacks. And finally, Lisa told us about and gave us a map of the beautiful Arboretum that is very near to her Airbnb. We spent a lovely fall Saturday morning walking in the Arboretum - one location has a great view of downtown.  It was a lovely stay - thank you!"
3988018,53805797,2015-11-13,32453898,Daniel,Lisa was very welcoming and nice. The space was accurate and exceeded our expectations. They are even snacks!!! The neighbourhood is safe and public transport is easy to access. We really enjoyed Boston and definitely stay at Lisa's place again.
3988018,54037773,2015-11-15,47648384,Asia,"Lisa was an excellent host. My friend and I both loved her pet bearded dragon Kaiju, and Lisa let us play with him upon our arrival. The room was exactly like the picture and there was a magnetic dartboard which was fun to play with. Although my friend and I were persistant tourists and decided to brave Boston's frigid autumn weather, if you decide you'd rather stay in, there are a ton of games available, the movie projector downstairs, and a rather large tv in the Sports room as well. The Charlie cards were extremely convenient and we used them the entire weekend. Lisa was also very understanding when we overslept on our last night."
3988018,54227851,2015-11-16,2119586,Bruce,Lisa was very welcoming.  The room was as it was described and even had chocolates on the bed. The living room was open for movies and the kitchen was well supplied.
3988018,54916835,2015-11-25,48410454,Curt,"I would have given 6 stars if there was the option!  Everything about the stay here was wonderful.  Lisa & Brian are spectacular hosts, very friendly, and did not hesitate to share information of how to navigate the city."
I had breakfast with other guests that were staying there,all of whom were friendly and kind.,,,,
The apartment had everything that we needed for an extended weekend stay.,,,,,
The neighborhood is a nice working class area.  Everyone I spoke to on the streets were pleasant and offered information as where to locate various places.,,,,,
The buses & trains were a breeze to manage and very convenient for accessing the city.,,,,,
This was my first Airbnb experience,and I feel that the bar was raised quite high by Lisa & Brian.,,,,
I would highly recommend staying here to any of my friends & family.,,,,,

3988018,55494793,2015-12-01,48820576,Boon Thiam,"I felt home when I stepped in this unit. Everthing was well-prepared. So much of entertainment provided but too bad we could'nt enjoy them since we were in a rush. Lisa gave us a warmful welcome when we arrived, showing us every corner of her house. We love the food prepared espcially during breakfast time. If I would have the chance to come back again, Lisa house is still my first choice."

3988018,59400509,2016-01-10,51410795,Kade,"My best friend and I stayed with Lisa and Brian for about a week. The room was amazing and had a ton of storage. They were friendly and great, it was so easily accessible by public transit and the passes made it amazingly easy to see parts of the city we had never dreamed of seeing. I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in Boston."
3988018,60085826,2016-01-18,31865526,Anoka,"This was my first time ever using Airbnb, and I truly feel that I lucked out. Lisa and Brian have a cute little set up, and all of the little touches helped the experience feel like staying over a friend's house. Thank you for everything!"

3988018,61016794,2016-01-30,9128923,Stacey,"My daughter and I absolutely LOVED staying here.  Lisa made us feel incredibly welcome, even when we got in much later than expected.  She had everything you could possibly want available, and the public transportation could not have been more convenient (literally right outside the door).  The bearded dragon fashion show was an added bonus. :) Thank you for a wonderful night!"
3988018,61432881,2016-02-04,53743223,Jinping,"lisa was so hospitable and helpful! She prepared all things needed for a trip like city subway map and charlie cards and she generously let me use the kitchen whenever. She gave answers to all of my questions, It was a easy and comfortable trip to Boston with Lisa's help! I definitely will recommend this place to my friends!"
3988018,61615023,2016-02-06,57072457,Andrew,"The host was very welcoming! She told me exactly how to get into the house and where to find my room. Once I got there I found a super clean room, comfy beds, and all the snacks I could want. :) I later got to meet my host, who was absolutely wonderful (and offered peanut butter cookies). The bathroom was great, as was the location: super close to the Orange Line. It was the perfect spot for my one night in Boston!"
3988018,61787879,2016-02-08,31828789,Kayce,"Lisa and Brian were absolutely fantastic hosts! They provided us with tons of tips and suggestions for things to do in the city. The transit passes were very convenient and the room was clean, comfy and welcoming.

This is the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in and I would recommend it to anyone! Just a fantastic experience all around!"
3988018,62229267,2016-02-13,28521442,Gaz,This was our first time using air bnb and it was everything we could have asked for. Lisa and Brian were absolutely amazing. Couldnt have asked for any more. The subway passes were perfect and really helped us get about the city.

"Highly recommend! :)\"",,,,,
3988018,62705427,2016-02-16,11480496,Jude,Comfortable twin room in a calm and cosy neighbourhood. Lisa and Brian were very kind people and think of everything for making your stay brilliant. Breakfast was great and the coffee machine was fab! Couldn't recommend more. The travel passes save you loads too.
3988018,62911067,2016-02-18,55261944,Cynthia,"Lisa was very friendly, welcoming and helpful.  Our room was comfortable and the house is convenient to public transportation so that I didn't have to drive my car into Boston.  The added perk of Charlie Cards and T map was very generous.  It was also nice to be able to walk to a delicious Indian restaurant that evening for dinner.  The downside of all this convenience however, is city background noise that we (as country bumpkins) are not used to, so sleeping was difficult.  But I would certainly recommend this place to others looking for a convenient, comfortable place to stay in the area."
3988018,64343477,2016-03-02,60795840,Jean-Philippe,"Très Bonne accueil, déjeuner simple mais bon. Avec le parking, les passes de bus et le déjeuner la chambre revient très peu cher !"
3988018,66715914,2016-03-24,57455238,Leisha,"Lisa and Brian were wonderful hosts for my friend and I. She welcomed us warmly, gave us clear information about how to get around Boston, made us feel at home, and enchanted us with her bearded dragon's costume changes.

3988018,69083459,2016-04-09,58353526,Robert,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have been more rewarding.  Lisa and her husband Brian made me and my son feel welcome from the time I made the reservation.  And when we arrived at her place, I realized this was a real HOME.  All the little touches made the experience special:  the complimentary mass transit passes, access to the kitchen, complimentary breakfast, the Lindor truffle on the bed, and a plate of home-made chocolate chip cookies.  Add to this the convenient location, and it added up to an A+ experience.  When traveling to Boston in the future, this will be my first choice."
3988018,69795529,2016-04-13,15198355,Daina,Lisa and her husband were great! the room was a great space and had everything we needed. They also suggested a great pub for food and drinks. The neighborhood felt very safe and my friend and I walked around at night comfortably. We only needed to stay one night but would love to return in the future.
3988018,70641992,2016-04-19,60994200,Tracey,We so appreciated Lisa's place for our short stay in Boston. Everything was as described. The transit passes were great and we got a good Indian dinner just down the street.  It can be hard to find places with 2 twin beds - that was what we needed. I'd recommend these accommodations to anyone!

3988018,73970645,2016-05-12,36628145,Abdallah,"Lisa listing was exactly as described and was a great host. The apartment was spotless and extremely inviting. Lisa made it a point to make me feel at home, leaving fresh baked cookies and Lindor chocolate, and clean sheets/towels for my visit. She was easy to contact and communicate with when I needed but allowed me to use her own apartment as if it was my own privacy wise. She even introduced us to her cute lizard and did a little dressing show for us :)  I highly recommend Lisa on Airbnb and hope to rent from again in the future. Well done!"
3988018,74280767,2016-05-14,65616087,Ryan,The sports room was a great spot to stay in Boston. The close proximity to the subway and the free passes provided made for getting around the city a breeze. Lisa is very welcoming and a great host. I would highly recommend a stay when you are in Boston.
3988018,75219964,2016-05-19,57340065,Jonnie,"Lisa and Brian were great at making us feel at home for our first AirBnB trip. They offered several suggestions to try while we were in the area, including some places we would never have considered beforehand. Bus/ subway passes were a HUGE advantage as we traveled all over the city, and the nearby subway station certainly helped. The rooms were well taken care of and breakfast was tasty. Would certainly consider if planning on visiting again."
3988018,76137024,2016-05-25,39068132,Anas,We had such a nice quiet stay at Lisa's house. She takes care of everything to make the visit experience great. She recommended us some places to visit and the way to go there. Her place is so nice and the location is very good.

3988018,76320972,2016-05-26,73753539,Rhys,"Lisa was great and booked us in for a last minute one-night-stay in Boston. She helped us out with travel plans, not to mention the free travel passes, and shaved a great deal of travel time for our trip to Fenway! Many thanks for allowing us to leave our bags after check out too. That was super helpful and saved us a lot of time and money. Highly recommend!"

They provided us with many useful resources and made sure all of our needs were met. Since we were unfamiliar with Boston, Lisa took the time to describe the city to us. She gave me many useful tips for when I will be actually moving here. Lisa and Brian are located in a very safe area. My mom and I felt safe walking around the area even at night. They are two very nice people and I highly recommend staying with them!"

Nous disposions de beaucoup de place dans la maison en plus de la chambre et de plusieurs possibilités de loisirs. Le logement était confortable. Nous nous sentions comme chez nous. Bon petit déjeuner.  Le fait d'avoir des cartes de métro est un plus considérable. Le quartier est agréable quoique un peu bruyant (circulation). Néanmoins, cela ne nous a pas empêché de dormir et, par ailleurs, la proximité avec les transports en commun est un aspect intéressant aussi. Nous avons eu des contacts vraiment sympathiques avec nos hôtes de même qu'avec d'autres résidents. Un endroit que nous recommandons."
3988018,79073384,2016-06-11,62300365,Michael (Mike),The room is in an older house typical of Philly and boston areas. Convenient to downtown and while the street was busy it seemed like a safe neighborhood. I parked my out of state suburban with no problems. I enjoyed chatting with Lisa and meeting their bearded dragon!!! The was another couple also staying there but I didn't hear a thing from anyone in the house. (I was also very tired). place was clean. bed was comfy. air conditioner pumped air from outside for me as the night was cool. great community style place to stay.
3988018,79228021,2016-06-12,3114021,Elyssa,"Lisa is awesome! This is the most accommodating airbnb host I've ever had. They had goodies for us in our room, free breakfast and coffee, free food in the fridge, a movie room with a popcorn maker, and of course free transportation passes, which makes everything much easier. They also introduced us to their awesome bearded dragon, Kaijo (?). They were super friendly and did not make us feel unwelcome at all. 6 out of 5 stars."

She and their lovely home are models for the concept and functionality of AIRBNB. The room is large, equipped with large screen TV, Lisa has charge plugs for every know device, and the air conditioner in the unusually high Boston temperatures was a blessing."
3988018,83897373,2016-07-04,79901991,Rupak,"The sports room like the rest of the house was very clean and equipped with all the amenities needed.

All in all, it was a great experience with very welcoming hosts, exactly we were looking for in a weekend trip."

The transit cards were a huge bonus- and they are a 10 minute walk from the train station! I'm very glad we booked with them, and would do so again in a heartbeat!"
3988018,92141648,2016-08-07,67397049,Bob,Lisa was very prompt in answering our emails and text messages. She accommodated our request to drop off our luggage before the check in time and met us at the door when we arrived.
The room we stayed in was clean and Lisa delivered fresh towels and linens promptly upon request. The kitchen had fresh fruit,cereal and coffee available among other things. Lisa is a baker and leaves cookies and pastries around which was nice.,,,,
I met a few of the other guests staying there which was fun. One young lady was from a city in Australia not far from where I visited many years ago. We had fun talking in the kitchen one morning over fresh coffee.,,,,,
The bonus feature of the stay with Lisa was the Charlie Cards she provides. They gave us unlimited access to  the very convenient public transportation system. Catching the bus was right across the street. Getting to downtown Boston was easy to navigate and there are always friendly people around to help with directions if needed. We usually had less than a 6 minute wait for the next bus or train and never more than 10 minutes.,,,,,

27141,234724,2011-04-22,238688,Kathy,"The locaton was perfect, we where pretty much less than a mile from Boston Commons, The Prudential Center, Traders Joes, and Starbucks was a 3 min walk. Highly recommend B & G Oysters, and Stepanies short walk."

27141,1948961,2012-08-11,2726305,Pascaline,"I spent three days with my husband and my two teenagers in this appartment. This one was very pleasant, nothing was missing. The double bed is very confortable and the sofa is convertible. So 4 people can easily stay in the appartment. It is not far away from a subway station. There are some groceries and restaurants in the street. Seamless quickly answered my e-mails. Our stay was delightful.  I recommend this appartment."
27141,4918826,2013-06-02,1497106,Jaclyn,"To start with, I have to say that the location is superb. Only a 7 minutes walk to Prudential centre, and lots of cafes and supermarkets nearby on Columbus Ave. We loved being in the centre of everything."
But,the apartment is not in the best of conditions. The toilets were dated. The apartment wasn't even properly cleaned. There were dustballs in many places. And the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable - the mattress was so thin you could feel the metal underneath.,,,,
Also,there isn't an elevator in the building. If your apartment happens to be on the third floor,as ours were,"you have to carry your luggage up several flights of very steep stairs. \"",,
9897713,59935853,2016-01-17,52892949,Meghan,Great apartment in east boston. Clean and comfortable. Fully furnished apartment. Free street parking. Accommodating for dogs.

6316145,34320786,2015-06-07,31017263,Madeline,"The apartment in Boston was described as beautiful but that did not do it justice. Everything in the apartment was top notch both in the cleanliness of the apartment, the quality of the furnishings and all the amenities. We were there for the baseball game and the location of the apartment was so convenient to everything we needed to get to. Audrey and Andy were amazing hosts. We arrived late at night and left early in the morning but they went out of their way to fit with our schedules to get the keys and show us how everything worked. We had total privacy when we were there. We could not recommend Audrey's apartment highly enough and will definitely stay there again when we are in Boston."
6316145,34659306,2015-06-10,33803281,Minjoo,IT'S SUPER NICE APT!!!!!!!!
Location) It is super nice place. To travel in Boston,it's very close to the bus stop (#39,under 5 min to walk ) and subway(orange line,green line). I had a big luggage but it wasn't hard at all to come to this apt.,,
Host) I asked Audrey to checkin earlier becuase I needed to move from another apt to this apt. Very kindly,she changed my checkin time after communicating with the guest checking out on that day. After checkin,I haven't seen her so it was very privacy. Also she gave me a list of nice restaurants and it really worked! and when I asked how to use hot water to Audery,she answered very fast with text message or e-mail. Nothing bothered me. I very appreciate Audrey and her husband.,,
Apt) It's surper nice. If I come back,I'll choose this apt again for sure. Everything is in the apt. In the kitchen,Microwave,refrigerator,coffe maker,clean spoon

The street that the apartment is on was great, very quite, lots of trees, very close to everything you need.  Walking distance to the subway, just 2 blocks away, and Whole Foods, another 2 blocks."
The apartment itself was very comfortable to stay in,and we were very glad that they had Air Conditioning since it was pretty warm while we were in Boston.  We also felt very safe in the neighbourhood walking at night,and no issues with homeless people.  All in all the place was great,would recommend it to all my friends.,,
"The only issue we had was that the comforter was too heavy for us.  Audrey took care of that right away and brought over a thinner one.  The hosts were great and we had no issues with them.\"",,,,,

The neighbourhood is just awesome,walking distance from Fenway Park (Go Red Sox Go!),everything is very calm and quiet (I was afraid of the morning noise,as I am a night owl,but I slept like a baby and had to get up reluctantly from the awesome bed.,
The air conditioning was working perfectly,not too noisy (almost silent),the bathroom was spic and span and the kitchen also spotless.,,,
Many MANY thanks for a great stay in Boston,"in an awesome apartment in an awesome neighbourhood.\"",,,,
6316145,40828752,2015-08-02,39247665,John,Audrey is a very gracious host and met me at the appointed check in time. She is excellent in communicating beforehand and is easy to reach during the stay.
The apartment is beautifully decorated just like in the photos. The strong A/C was very welcome while visiting midsummer. There is a full kitchen for cooking or reheating. The location is very convenient if you're visiting Northeastern University,and is a short 10 minute walk to Bolyston,Newbury and the Prudential or Copley Square shopping centers. In the other direction,"it's a 15 minute walk to Fenway Park or to Boston University. I'm looking forward to staying here in future visits to the city.\"",,
6316145,41223204,2015-08-05,2123234,Graziella,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Audrey's beautiful apartment for 2 nights. Needless to say, she was a perfect host, along with her husband Steven who greeted us to show us the apartment. We arrived  rather late from Paris and they patiently waited for us to get there. The apartment was absolutely perfect and cutely decorated, giving it a warm, cosy feel, exactly like in the pictures. The plus? It's on a wonderful, quaint, all-brick and typical Boston street lined up with lush trees. The apartment is very conveniently located, not far from Fenway and it's famous Red Sox games, Symphony Hall and the Prudential, boasting plenty of amenities around it (from Symphony market -open 24/7, to a Whole Foods just around the corner and a nice Pavement Cafe for morning coffee runs). Our experience was seamless and we couldn't have felt more at home. We miss it already :)"
6316145,42305057,2015-08-12,15958158,Andrea,Audrey and Steven were great hosts. The apartment was very nice and perfectly compliant to the decription and the photos. Wonderful experience for me and my girlfriend

6316145,44137031,2015-08-24,10929322,Donna,"Our stay was perfect.  The apt was exactly as described, very clean, fully renovated, like new.  Spacious, homey.  Had everything we needed.  The bed was very comfortable with great linens, although we are used to a king size so that took some getting used to. :-) Our host could not have been more responsive and dependable, waiting for us with keys and to help in any way she could even though we arrived in the evening.  Neighborhood & building very safe.  Short walk to subway stops.  Not a ton of restaurants in the immediate area (a few) but many a short distance away if you like to walk or take the subway.  Or a short cab ride or Uber.  Very central to everything.  We walked everywhere.  Loved our stay and hope to be back!"
6316145,45372755,2015-09-02,14376843,Peggy,"The condo was so cute and exactly as advertised. Everything worked perfectly. You do need to wait 15-20 minutes between each shower for the water to get hot again, but once we planned for it, it was easy to get used to. Audrey was so helpful and answered every question we had very promptly. This location is in a beautiful brownstone neighborhood near Northeastern and is within walking distance to everything you might need. We were moving our son into his college dorm and had a lot of stuff, so the elevator was an added bonus. We loved this place, and would happily recommend it to anyone. We hope to stay here again when we're visiting Boston in the future!!!"
6316145,45667308,2015-09-05,37045385,Jo Ann,The apartment is exactly as described.  We enjoyed our stay very much.  Location is awesome if your going to a game - as it is in within walking distance.  We also had purchased online tickets for a trolley tour and 2 pickup locations are within walking distance as well.   So for us it worked out beautifully.

You can tell that great care was taken with the apartment--from the kitchen appliances to the bathroom tiling.  It is kept very clean."
We really enjoyed the central location of this apartment.  It was about a 10 minute walk for me to get to the Hynes Convention Center for a conference.  We enjoyed walking 5-6 minutes to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.,,,,,
"We wouldn't hesitate to stay again!\"",,,,,

We never worried when leaving or when returning. If we needed anything, there were shops, markets, and restaurants right around the corner. The apartment itself was impeccable. Very clean, spacious, and modern. There were nights we decided to just stay in and watch TV -- that's how comfortable and enjoyable the place is. Christina was amazing. She replied promptly and was so accommodating. We honestly could not have chosen a better place to stay."
6316145,51114239,2015-10-18,36568839,Chris,We had a wonderful time in Boston - location was perfect for our visit at Northeastern.   The apartment was very nice and very comfortable.  The street was bustling with activity late at night - but that should be expected in a college town.  There was a little confusion on our end with which apartment we were staying in - but Stephen was able to quickly find us and get us back on track.
6316145,51435429,2015-10-20,18344534,Jon,"Very lovely, clean, modern and comfy apartment, and well equipped. Short and cheap metro ride into central Boston or walkable if feeling fit. Samuel Adams brewery only 2 stops away (stony park), well worth a visit. Good recommendation from host for dinner was Giocomo's (14 min walk), great Italian food."
Tip: if you have a late flight and want to explore Boston you can leave your luggage at Rowes Wharf Water Transport ($10 uber) after check out for a small fee,this worked out well for us as the water taxi goes to the airport.,,,,
Ps.If driving to the city beware as there are very limited street parking options in Boston as a whole,and car parks are quite expensive ($30 a day). This is not specific to this apt,"but a general observation!\"",,,
6316145,52397741,2015-10-29,40955117,Karen,Stephen was most helpful in guiding us to the apt from the train station and we had no problem finding it.  He was most helpful and prompt to answer any texts.
6316145,52680319,2015-11-01,14644635,Aaron,Our stay in Boston was great - mostly in part to the wonderful hosts and this lovely apartment! The hosts had great communication when we landed and were able to meet us right away. The apartment is just as cute as the photos and everything was very clean.

6316145,56614128,2015-12-15,7832686,Yumi,"What a fantastic stay at Christina's lovely apartment in Boston! The apartment is comfortably furnished and gets a lot of sunlight, which is something I always appreciate when away from home. It's located in a very convenient part of the city, and, since weather was so wonderful while I was in town, I took full advantage and walked everywhere. Almost everything I needed was in walk distance -- Trader Joe's, the archives at Boston University, cute cafes -- and for everything else, the Orange and Green lines were easy to catch. The building itself is also very quiet, and while there was a little bit of noise outside during the weekend due to college students walking by, I fully expected that and wasn't bothered; it's no more than what you would expect when you're in a major city."
Christina and Steven were fantastic hosts; they knew I had luggage with me so arranged to let me check in a bit earlier and check out a bit later as well. They also checked in with me partway through my six day stay to make sure everything was going well and to see if they could be of help in any way.,,,,,

Steven met us with the keys when we arrived, but we did not see either of them again during our visit, although they did check in with us by email to see how we were going.   Unfortunately, unlike pre us raiders, we did not find the apartment to be very clean.  The fridge contained several portions of unfinished take away food and drink, and the fridge itself was in need of a good clean.  The dishwasher had not been run since the previous guests left and there were dirty glasses put away in the cupboard.  We threw away food and dealt with the dishes, but were disappointed to have to do that soon after our arrival.  Otherwise it was a great spot to stay."

6316145,75042809,2016-05-18,60420934,Kenny,"Emily was a great host and the apartment was just as advertised.  Incredible location.  Could walk everywhere.  Clean and mostly comfortable.  We did have a little trouble sleeping.  The mattress is especially hard and because the winds were up, branches continuously scraped against the bedroom window.  It's also worth noting that there isn't a lot of hot water capacity, so showers have to be spaced out so the water can replenish.   Finally, there's nowhere to leave a key so it required coordination (i.e. many texts) to meet up to get keys.  Despite all this, I'd still recommend Emily's place.  Just a few things that travelers should be aware of."

Parking was the only draw back.  Since we were only there for 2 nights we parked in the public lot at the end of the block.  Our car was safe there and we didn't have to worry about getting ticketed or towed.,,,,,

The street is a quiet residential street, in a neighborhood that has many university students (but not rowdy students at all).  The building is located close to shopping, restaurants, and tourist attractions.  The owner, Christina and her husband are wonderful hosts.  We could not have asked for anything more from them -- they were attentive to our needs, offering to help throughout our 10 day stay.  We will definitely return to this condo.  Everything was just as described on the AirbnB listing.  Thank you both for such a wonderful stay!  Until next time!"

The location is convenient and cool, even at moments where the Red Sox fans were swarming the streets. The apartment was great in every sense: comfortable, intimate, spacious and well equipped. Despite our last-minute request, Seamless replied very fast, and was flawless in securing our stay. The only downside was the internet connection, which was incredibly slow. Overall, we had a great time in this great place and would surely recommend it to anyone."
951476,6759919,2013-08-24,148789,Adam,"While others have had great experiences with Seamless, ours was unfortunately not a good one."
We booked a different apartment,but were informed the day before move in that the original apartment had a plumbing problem so we were moved into this one. But that was only after I called to ask why we didn't have move in instructions yet (I'd sent 3 emails asking where the move in instructions were with no reply).,,,,
This apartment had had a long term renter in it that moved out the day before we arrived.  Seamless' cleaning crew worked on it all day and when we arrived it appeared clean on the surface,so we moved in.  Once we were in though we started to see just how dirty it was.  Filthy.  Old food stuck in the kitchen,food stuck in the kitchen sink,sticky spots on the floor,dirty furniture,dirty carpet.  On top of being dirty there was a burned out light bulb in the bathroom
I emailed Seamless 3 times while we were in the apartment about the filth and the issues with the apartment and never received a reply.  That's 6 total emails to them without a reply.  I would never rent from them again.,,,,,

The space was incredibly nice and neat. Ideal for a couple or individual. The kitchenette was perfect for medium cooking as it has a stove, refrigerator and has cleaning supplies to cleanup after! The bathroom has a bath/shower, mirrored medicine cabinet with premium bath products from Whole Foods. The bed is quite firm (maybe a pillow top mattress cover would be worth considering), but the pillows and bedding are nice. As summer visitors, the AC was incredible. Overall, I give this place a 9/10 due to quality of the space, convenience of location and constant communication with Dylan. Dylan is a great host! Thanks again and we hope to come back next year!"

I liked the neighborhood as it was only about 20 min subway/metro to downtown boston and much affordable compared to the downtown core. There is a short walk from the subway station (~5-10 min). Also to mention that this place can accommodate 5-6 ppl. The kitchen very clean and lots of stuff were brand new.

Perry was also very responsive. He checked with us a few times before our stay,and we mentioned that we were traveling with our toddler. He arranged for a crib to be set up and for a high chair to be ready in the kitchen. When we arrived,we found that the cleaning crew hadn't cleaned the high chair. We informed Perry and he immediately dropped by to take the chair to be cleaned. Not 30 minutes later,he returned with a spotless chair!,,
We were also concerned because our toddler is now getting mischievous and we forgot to pack our outlet covers. Again,we asked Perry if he had any extra,and he delivered quickly,yet again! 5-star service for sure!,,

Perry is a super host:  full of great info, thoughtful (he even took our dog for a walk!), and fun. We were inspired by the diversity and vernacular architecture of the JP community and found lots within walking distance to keep us busy (Sam Adams tour, Franklin Park, Doyle's, lots of restaurants, the Arnold Arboretum).  But also downtown Boston is an easy T-ride, hiking in the Blue Hills is a 30-minute drive, and Cape beaches are only an hour away.  Obviously we need to come back if you'll have us!"

He was in constant communication with me. The room was clean, the apartment smelled great, and the view was amazing! He lives in a very central location of Boston and everything is nearby. I had a 10K on my last day and George was very flexible with my check out time. Overall, 5+ stars for George. Highly recommended! I can't wait to come back."
6609546,42206360,2015-08-11,13215686,Mark,"I can only echo what everyone else has said, George was a great host and the apartment is clean and has a beautiful view.  We were only in Boston for a short time before flying out from Logan early the next morning.  The location is great for getting to the airport - 10 minutes by Taxi and a few minutes more if you walk to the Silver line."

6609546,42314417,2015-08-12,37335667,Anthony,"The room was great and exceeded my expectations. The picture hardly does justice to the actual views. Super clean, easy check in and check out. I was especially impressed by the bathroom amenities: toothpaste, mouthwash, soaps, etc. The location is great, right near many great restaurants and only 2 blocks from where I was working. I highly recommend George's place. And George was a great host, never got to meet him in person, but he was very responsive when I needed anything. Everything went smoothly. Plus, when hotels in that area are going for more than double the price, this place is a no brainer!"
6609546,43380301,2015-08-19,37160287,Andrea,"George was very welcoming and accommodating. The apartment is beautiful, and is located in a focal area. My husband attended a career fair at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, to which this apartment is very close to (5 minutes walking distance)."
The view is amazing,and if you like sunrises,then this is the place to be.,,,
The room and bathroom were very clean and nice toiletries were also provided.,,,,,
Overall,George was very friendly and we definitely recommend you to stay in his place! You won't regret it!,,,,

6609546,45288892,2015-09-01,11825825,Nate,"Great place, great host. The views of the Boston harbor were worth the stay on their own, and on top of that George kept a clean apt and helped make the stay easy"
6609546,45454667,2015-09-02,16590291,Josh,"Great communication from start to finish - even though we never actually met. George's place is nice, super-clean and in a great location, near the Silver Line. The bed is a pull-out daybed, nice and large. Not the ultimate comfort mattress, but not bad...and in this neighborhood, where you can't touch a hotel room for less than $350+, it's a tiny inconvenience for an overall sweet place to stay. Thanks for being a great host, George!"
6609546,46723328,2015-09-13,38935061,Augusto,"Lovely neighbourhood, great appartment. Cousy, very well kept and outstanding view. George was super helpful and we didn't even notice him there. Comes with access to a great gym, also very cool."
6609546,47381070,2015-09-18,8898571,Patricia,"George was very efficient and available to me although I had few needs beyond check-in which was smooth and quick. The room was clean. The views were as described. The neighbourhood felt safe. I stayed 3 nights, each night I returned after dark. ever once felt threatened  The location was good. Close to public transportation. The stay was better than expected."
6609546,48539644,2015-09-27,40713496,Elizabeth,Great building in a convenient location with paid parking underneath if you need it.  George made things easy and was very communicative in order to get the key.   The apartment has a great view and is really quiet.  It's set up well for a convenient rental.       Overall I had a very good experience that worked out well for my conference.
6609546,49449991,2015-10-04,5374826,Zhan,"The apartment is beautiful, clean and quiet.  It's about 5 min's walk to the boston world trade center and seaport hotel. You can see the beautiful seaport view through the window. There are plenty of restaurants and a nice grocery store downstairs. If you like seafoods and lobster, you can buy them at the Yankee  lobster, they are live and fresh.  And the transportation is very convenient , the silver line is close which transfer from the airport to the south station. There is a kitchen with all utensils where you can cook as you like. The bathroom is clean and provide towels ,toothpaste and bath supplies. The host  George is a very nice and considerate gentleman.  I strongly recommend this apartment and I think I will be back next time if I visit Boston again."
6609546,50185850,2015-10-10,3376505,Samit,The place was perfect. The location was terrific. George was helpful too. It is worth the amount - you are connected to the public transport - in walking distance of entire downtown Boston. The room is a little small with two beds - but then that's fine. You are probably going to be out most of the day anyway!
6609546,51439288,2015-10-20,41768407,Ligia,"A wonderful place to stay, very close to the convention center and boston world trade center. The room is confortable with a private bathroom just across the hall. There are 2 single beds that can be put together to make a double bed. The mattresses are confortable but a bit too soft for my friend's injured back."
George is great host and I couldn't even notice his presence in the apartment. He made sure we had everything to make us feel at home. I definitely recomend staying there!,,,,,
Um lugar maravilhoso para ficar,muito perto do centro de convenções e do boston world trade center. O quarto é confortável,com um banheiro privado logo do outro lado do corredor. Tem 2 camas de solteiro que podem ser colocadas juntas para formar uma cama de casal. Os colchões são confortáveis,"mas um pouco moles demais para as costas da minha amiga. O George é um ótimo anfitrião e eu nem podia notar sua presença no apartamento. Ele fez de tudo para nos sentirmos em casa. Eu com certeza recomendo a hospedagem!\"",,
6609546,51715106,2015-10-24,6700007,Maria,The place is beautiful and very well located. Close enough from the airport taking the silver line and walking distance if you like to walk to downtown Boston. Very clean and comfortable. George was a great host always responding fast when we had any questions. He even provided us with shampoo and other supplies for the bathroom. We are coming back again for sure!

6609546,52874371,2015-11-02,2550495,Guy,"Just as the title says: Beautiful Waterfront Location - and when I stayed Boston put on some nice weather so I could appreciate it. The place was great, as in the pictures - very nice bathroom, well appointed and George goes the extra mile providing amenities. The location was excellent for me as I had a conference near by - but it is also a 15 minute walk from down town."
There is a concierge and a gym,so you kind of feel like you are in a hotel. George was communicative and accommodating,"I would highly recommend it.\"",,,
6609546,53689511,2015-11-11,18758375,Sungwon,"This is a great apartment with such a beautiful ocean view. The room was clean and amenities were in a very good condition. It is very convenient to have a private bathroom right in front of the bedroom, so you never need to bother the host (George) who lives in the master bedroom -- I actually could not have any chance to encounter him at all during my 4-day stay. However, George is very kind to take care of guests via emails and/or text messages. In addition, one of the best part of this apartment is the location -- right next to a lot of hotels and conference centers."
"I fully enjoyed my stay at this beautiful waterfront apartment. Thanks George!\"",,,,,
6609546,63024587,2016-02-19,4380737,Anirban,"Clean, close to where I needed to be, more amenities than I normally see at an Airbnb listing. Great host as well!"

6609546,65017166,2016-03-10,28313045,Edwin,George was very prompt on his reply to my messages.
I actually didn't know that George was living on the same apartment but it was cool.  George is a very nice guy. We talked for a while but he had to leave right away to catch a flight.,,,,,
Checking in and out was very fast.  He told me to take the free bus ride from airport to the city. The bus ride took about 10 minutes and from the bus station,I just walked about 5 minutes to the apartment.,,,,
The apartment was very clean and the room has a very nice view of fish port and sea. Lots of restaurants around and a nearby grocery and Convenience store too.,,,,,
Wifi has very strong signal whether inside the room or the living room. It was so nice to work on the living room because of the great view.,,,,,
What you see in the pictures are accurate. The bed was very comfortable and both the room and living room have cable tv.,,,,,
The washroom was very clean. One thing I must tell George is to replace his bath towel. The one I used had a big hole. But I am a guy so it wasn't a big issue.. BUT if his guest was a female,might be an issue.,,,,
I also received a nice gift from George on my second night. He left a gift certificate on the table from one of the restaurants that he manages. Thank you so much for the nice gesture. I enjoyed my dinner.,,,,,
The residents living in this apartment were very nice and courteous. This is a pleasant surprise to me.,,,,,
I will surely visit Boston again because of the seafood show. I will definitely stay in this apartment again if available.,,,,,

I arrived for a conference and took the Silver Line for free from the airport to the first stop (Boston World Trade Center), and the apartment was a 5 minute walk away. Beautiful view from the bedroom, living room and 9th floor roof deck. George is great about communicating and pretty much gives you a lot of space at the apartment. You have access to a private gym a block away. I'd come back here in a hearbeat."

The apartment is situated in a really lovely residential area of Brighton with excellent transport links to both Boston and Cambridge, making it fantastic for commuting to work. The local area has great amenities including shops, restaurants, bars etc, and a public swimming pool and other sports facilities nearby."
The host Masha and her husband were extremely welcoming and helpful from the moment I arrived in Boston,which was very appreciated given that I was traveling alone and was far from home. They were always on hand if I had questions or needed anything. The apartment is quite spacious,clean and well kept. The kitchen has all the basics needed and the sofa comfortably sleeps a guest if required. The decked area outside was well used by me and makes for a lovely chill out area catching the afternoon sunshine.,,,

Cons: The building (particularly the shared bathroom) was pretty dirty. I think it gets cleaned once a week,"although some of the grime in the bathroom seemed older than a week. The fridge in my room was stained and smelled horrible when I opened it - luckily I didn't have to store any food during my stay.\"",,,,
6314998,34900254,2015-06-13,34744997,Mingjing,"Great place to stay. Spacious room, really close to airport, safe neighbors. Definitely loved here."
6314998,40639271,2015-08-01,34149619,David,The room is big and clean. The subway(Orient Heights) is just 2-3 minutes walk. I love this stay.
6314998,43706366,2015-08-21,41397027,Joni,"The room was very nice for the price and just as described. Self check-in was easy the host was available by text to answer questions and give me directions. The room was very comfortable, we slept well, and enjoyed our time. Thank you."
6314998,44365700,2015-08-25,23855500,Maria Carolina,"Muy comodo, limpio el cuarto y muy cerca de la estación del tren Orient Heights. Si deberían poner como regla de la casa que en el baño no se entren a secarse el cabello las damas, pues al ser un baño compartido las personas no pueden esperar a que los demás terminen con su arreglo sabiendo que se puede hacer al interior de cada cuarto. de resto super bien."
6314998,44503479,2015-08-26,11068057,Graciela,"Host isn't onsite so I didn't meet her. She was SUPER responsive to my messages and questions. Check-in process was simple, room was perfect for my one night there to write quietly and sleep. Walking to the beach and the Mama Blanca restaurant for tasty food was easy, safe. I'd stay there again w/o hesitation. Thank you!"

6314998,46648246,2015-09-12,42149948,Sammi,Tidy room and comfortable bed. Very short walk to the train station to get into the centre of Boston. If I'm back in Boston I'd be happy to stay at Quinn-May's place again.

6314998,47858679,2015-09-21,8788483,My,"We stayed at Quinn-Mays place for one night after a long flight from Europe. It was the perfect place for us since we arrived in the middle of the night. The room is very close to the airport, and it was no problem finding it. The room was clean and spacious. Wi-Fi was fast."
We would definitely stay there again,if it were for one or two nights.,,,,

L'immeuble est proche de l'aéroport, mais ça ne cause pas de nuisances sonores. De plus, la plage est très proche. Aussi, les lits sont confortables."

The bad: cleanliness. The towels smelled,the showers had dirt and hair,the dishes had grime on them and the hosts only showed up once a week. This makes perfect sense to me for the rooms,but the common areas needed more attention. The room was in a position which exposed us to smoke from another resident (it came in from the outside porch) and light from the inside,"as there was a window to the hallway.\"",
6314998,67725298,2016-03-30,58305963,Nicolás,"The place was really comfortable, everything was as described and better than than it looked. The location is amazing, the subway is really close and there is a unexpensive chinese restaurant nearby, which we utterly loved. Recomended %100."
6314998,68254648,2016-04-03,58886403,Christin,"Everything was fine and we had clean bedroom. There was a fridge at our room and we could use the kitchen. The house is near by the train station, so it was easy to visit beautiful Boston. May was very friendly and told us everything we needed to know."
6314998,68542704,2016-04-05,33613702,Christopher,"Good experience. This place is pretty much a hostel. When we arrived, my name was on the door of my room and the room was orderly and clean. There are several other rooms in this place with other guests staying, reminds me of a dormitory. There is a communal bathroom, shower, and kitchen, which were all clean. We never saw any host and seldom ran into the other guests. We mostly used this room to lay our heads as we explored Boston. There is a CVS within walking distance and a really good pizzeria called Nicks that delivered. Also, the high point of this place, is the proximity of the Orient Heights MBTA station. You walk out the front door and be at the subway station in 3 minutes, and ride the blue line down to the airport or downtown in minutes. All around, a good experience."
6314998,69555813,2016-04-11,64083249,Jose Angel,"Lo mejor: habitación grande, luminosa, con nevera y espacio de sobra para dos o tres personas, muy bien ubicado, a pocos minutos del metro. Precio adecuado. Lo peor: el termostato de la habitación estaba fijo a 17C y siempre hacía frío (estaba fijo, no se podía ajustar). Un día la habitación bajó de temperatura a los 15C. La dueña llamó a mantenimiento pero nadie vino a solucionar el problema. La habitación no estaba limpia, bajo las camas no se había barrido hace mucho tiempo. Otro punto negativo es las toallas de ducha. Solo teníamos una por persona para toda la estancia (6 días)."
6314998,70558454,2016-04-18,916799,Tony,Very convenient for our quick stop in Boston before catching an early flight. Five minute walk to the train which runs to the airport. Basic room with a comfy bed. Easy to check in and out. Nothing flashy.
6314998,71507649,2016-04-25,43438288,Daniel,"The location of the house is great, with restaurants, pharmacies and the blue line T train (which takes you to downtown) close by. The room itself is nice, it was clean and came with a fridge and AC unit. The bathrooms were pretty decent. One thing though is that behind the furniture next to the door there are gaps leading to the hallway because the window panes don't reach the floor. So if you have noisy housemates it might be a problem. Otherwise, I would stay here again for the price."
6314998,75164431,2016-05-19,44631181,Xiyu,"Wonderful place to stay, very convenient in terms of transportation. Quiet at night. The bedroom is very comfortable as well."

We had no problem checking-in. The host also allowed us to store our luggage before and after check-in/out. The room itself was nice, with the air conditioner turned on before checking-in. All in all, the place was great and accessible with the Metro within walking distance."

6314998,80421644,2016-06-18,19485992,Tuong-Van,"This place is like a student house. We stayed in a room and shared the kitchen and the bathrooms with 3 more groups of people, some of which live there as tenants. The room itself is spacious enough for a couple and perhaps a small child. Bedsheets and towels were clean and fresh. Perhaps also because we arrived on a Monday and the cleaning is usually done on Sundays. The fridge inside the room was handy. The kitchen was always a bit busy and there were not enough cutlery, dishes, and kitchen utensils to cook. Although we intended to cook, we ate out throughout our 4-day stay in the end. The bathrooms were not the cleanest ones in the world but were decent. We never met the host and the hostess but received enough information to get into the house. It was also very easy to find as it was only 3 min walking from the train/metro/subway station. One side note is that the house is right on the side of a big street and the isolation of the house is insufficient. If you are a light sleeper like me you might find it difficult to sleep as you can hear everything from other rooms and especially the noisy traffic. Also, the curtains and blinds were white and transparent so in summer it gets bright really early."

The room came with a queen size bed that was really comfortable, the towels and sheets were high quality, and the room had been professionally cleaned when I arrived.  Super nice living room and kitchen, with everything I needed (dishes, cooking pots and pans, microwave, silverware) and having a washer/dryer in the apartment was really convenient.  The neighborhood is mostly residential, and it's close to a shopping plaza at the end of the street that has a big grocery store, place to buy wine and beer, a few restaurants, and breakfast place. The bus is also right there and it takes you to Harvard Square in under 10 minutes....could also walk to Harvard Square, but the bus is so convenient that I just took that most of the time."

It is also located on a green neighborhood where there is a mall, groceries and restaurants - pretty much everything- within a walk distance! We had everything we need in the kitchen. It was also easy to go Harvard or downtown. Todd was a super welcoming and friendly host. We had a wonderful stay - we wanted to extend our stay but the house was already booked in advance!

7805515,72664003,2016-05-04,8690445,James,"Very comfortable accommodations in a safe working class neighborhood 2 miles from Harvard Square.  Newly remodeled 3-story  town home set up for Airbnb community living.  I had a 12x12 private bedroom with a walk in closet, fast wifi, new hardwood floors, and a newly remodeled spotless bathroom. Path to the bathroom crossed a public area.  I did not uses the community kitchen or living area, but they were well appointed  and just what you would need.  I want to emphasize that the Airbnb presentation of this is somewhat misleading.  You are not renting an apartment.  This is a unique Airbnb community living space, but as such, it could not have been nicer.  Excellent for professionals or single parents visiting Harvard.  $7 Uber to Harvard Square or a$2.00 bus ride.  If you can handle the community living aspect, this is Airbnb in Boston at its best."
7805515,74280219,2016-05-14,60683213,Kevin(Haoliang),A very livable and comfortable room that Todd provided to me. It were  very cleaning and being quiet when you live in there.

7805515,99154786,2016-09-03,74095385,Michael,"Todd's place is a great airbnb community in a nice and, from my impression over the course of five weeks, safe neighborhood. There are five rooms and three bathrooms in total in the house, I had a private bathroom across the floor of my room. The room was perfectly clean, beautifully designed and comfortable. People in the community were mostly academics staying for a couple of weeks or short-term visitors. The common areas were well-equipped and cleaned regularly. Todd wrote e-mails in advance, perfectly organized the arrival and responded to every question in short time. There is a star market close by, which also has a hubway station from where you can easily pick up bikes to go to Harvard or Boston. The bike ride to Harvard Yard is less than 20 minutes, a taxi ride from and to the airport takes 15 minutes. All in all, the apartment is perfect for visitors to Harvard University."

The space is air conditioned and very comfortable.  The common space was perfect for our group of three couples to be able to relax and chat without utilizing one of the sleeping rooms. Having the exclusive access to the cupula was really special!,,,,,

You know how when you travel you always feel great getting back to your own shower? Well, I got home and immediately missed this shower - it is tall with great pressure. I enjoyed the many dining options in Back Bay so I didn't really utilize the kitchen but very much appreciated that a Brita water pitcher was available for me. It looks *just* like the photos and M even left out some sundries in the bathroom had I forgotten any. The listing has 'small' in the title but it isn't overly small and was an advantage during the week of heat that the air conditioning could get the space down to temperature without having to leave it running while away. Also, this place is only about four blocks from Cheers. Yeah, that Cheers. Also, it is an easy walk to catch a game at Fenway Park in the other direction. I also made it down to the Museum of Fine Art (free on Wednesday night!). This was my first visit to Boston and I loved staying at this central location with the many parks. You're here because you appreciate the shared economy that we live in, well, Boston has both Uber and Lyft as well as Hubway, short term one-way bike rentals with stations all over town."

6214710,55924705,2015-12-07,3916376,Eric,"This is a nice place. Not huge, but larger than a hotel room, with a kitchen. M was very accommodating. This is in a great Back Bay location - easy walking distance to do many things. The next time I'm in Boston, I'm going to ask M to stay there again. Thanks M!"
6214710,59543170,2016-01-11,41643167,Lior,Excellent location. Apt 100% ready for guests.
6214710,68398817,2016-04-04,60232705,Susanna,"De verhuurder was erg behulpzaam.  Ook al hebben we elkaar niet onmoet,  heeft ze vooraf en ook tijdens het verblijf snel op praktische vragen gereageerd.  De lokatie is fantastisch,  het appartement zelf gezellig en zeker als je alleen reist, prima van grootte.  Een fijn bed en een fijne douche. Het is er wel vrij donker,  de ramen komen uit op een binnenplaats, maar als je er overdag toch niet veel bent is dat natuurlijk geen probleem."
6214710,69857644,2016-04-14,31699316,Rochelle,The description was very accurate and the apartment was very sweet.  The location was amazing!  It was exactly what I needed and I would definitely stay again!  M was very gracious and communicative all along the way.
6214710,70619126,2016-04-19,34845448,Brad,"This studio apartment is located in a great location in the Back-Bay.  Was a perfect location to run the Boston Marathon.  Close to the finish line, and easy access to the running paths along the Charles River.  Was within easy walking of distance of everything I needed to have a great trip.  Mila was a great host and easy to communicate with.  The studio was clean and ready for me upon arrival.  Thanks!"
6214710,71133754,2016-04-23,11204426,Carl,"Host was very responsive to messaging and helpful in facilitating key pick up. The neighborhood was very walkable, centrally located, and fun to explore. The apartment was clean, well maintained, and comfortable; just as advertised. Would stay here again."
6214710,71689982,2016-04-27,52638972,Jesse,M's apartment is perfect for one person - very cozy. Not the ideal spot if you're looking for a place to lounge. Easy to find and in a very convenient location. Everything that you need for a quick stay in Boston.
6214710,72149781,2016-05-01,63969053,Cherish,This place was absolutely perfect! The apt is small but charming and had everything we needed.  M even had coffee and creamer for us :)  The location was amazing and it was so easy to get around to all the sites in Boston.  Everything was very clean and tidy and M was very quick to respond to questions and made this whole experience a breeze.  Thank you and if I'm ever back in Boston I will certainly be staying here again!
6214710,73454570,2016-05-08,8535596,Teresa,"This is a clean and cozy apartment on a beautiful tree-lined street in a killer Back Bay location. It's just a few blocks from lively Newbury Street, the gorgeous Boston Public Library and convenient T stops. Mila was a dream hostess, quickly responding to all inquiries and stopping by with extra towels . And the price can't be beat! Thank you, Mila, for the wonderful stay!"
6214710,73796960,2016-05-10,301119,Melanie,Perfect place. Wonderfully quaint and clean. Location was perfect for whale watching during the day (gorgeous 15 minute walk) and Fenway at night (easy 10 minute walk). Excellent food was within 2 minutes! Back Bay train station was close enough to walk with luggage. Bed was comfy...shower was great. Two thumbs up!!!
6214710,75891691,2016-05-23,20020398,Vanda,"Communicating with Mila was seamless. She contacted me very early on and checked in a few times between my booking and actual arrival. She sent a very thorough instructional email - easy to understand and follow upon arrival. The rental was just as described! The Back Bay neighborhood was charming, accessible, and so fun to walk around. Her apartment was tidy, with lots of amenities. Would love to stay at Mila's on my return trip to Boston."

7731797,46752917,2015-09-13,34282870,Nicolas,"Great location, very nice apartment. However, the first two nights I was missing:"
-A/C unit (featured on listing...The temperature was really warm,this was early September,during the day it reached 90 degrees),,,
-Chairs for the round center table (the listing images have chairs),,,,,
-Shower curtain,,,,,
-Trashcans for the kitchen and bathroom (never got these),,,,,
-Pans/pots for stove (never got these),,,,,
The lighting was poor as well,the main area were the bed and round table were only had a small spotlight-like light,that hardly illuminated the place.,,,
Once I got most of the stuff I needed,the experience was definitely superior. With all the stuff mentioned above propoerly installed and available in the apartment,"I would give the experience 5 stars. However I only had a 5 star experience 4 of the 6 nights I stayed. I would've also given a 5 star rating if my issues would've been solved on the same day I got there.\"",,,
7731797,51592296,2015-10-21,12074185,Mark,"Great location, clean, neat and tidy! Well furnished and great for a single or couple."
7731797,51783038,2015-10-24,45743596,Judy,"The location of this rental ideal for a visit to Boston. The studio apartment is lovely, and looks pretty much exactly the same as the listing photo, but the building that houses it is run down. This particular unit is 4th floor walk-up. Not great if you travel with heavy luggage. There were ant traps and insecticides all over the kitchen, which made me uneasy, but I did not see any insects."
Bottom line,given the opportunity to stay here again,"I would decline.\"",,,
7731797,55103578,2015-11-28,29714352,Alexander,"This apartment was fantastic! It's located in a beautiful brownstone building on Newbury, very close to some great restaurants and shops; pretty much anything you could want is within a 5 minute walk, including a drugstore and market less than a minute away!"
The apartment itself is well-lit,spacious for a sing glee guest or a couple sharing a bed,and well equipped with the necessary amenities. I loved having a washer/dryer for my two week stay.,,,
Flatbook's customer service people were fantastic,very quick to reply and helpful with any questions or concerns.,,,,
Overall,"I would book here again in a heartbeat. You can't beat an apartment like this on the top floor of a central Newbury brownstone!\"",,,,
7731797,55374896,2015-12-01,2262944,Kevin,"Very nice flat in an awesome location - dozens of restaurants, bars, and shops just outside the door.  The Flatbook staff was super prompt in all of their replies and were flexible w/ my check-in and check-out times which I greatly appreciated.  I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Boston."
7731797,56774941,2015-12-18,4732476,Laura,"Fantastic place in a great location that had everything we needed for a great three days in Boston. Flatbook staff were really helpful leading up to our stay, offering plenty of advice about things to do and see in Boston. Arriving and letting ourselves into the apartment was easy and fuss-free and the apartment itself was immaculate - very clean and had everything we needed, including a fully equipped kitchen and washing machine. Would definitely use Flatbook again, and recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Boston."
7731797,57101235,2015-12-21,51418194,Roxanne,"\"I had a fantastic stay in Boston with Flatbook. The combination of the location on Newbury St with the low cost and quality amenities was primo! They made the reservation and subsequent communication process so easy. Although, when I arrived at the apartment, I didn't know the room number, so finding the right lock box for the given code gave off the \"\"I'm breaking into the place\"\" vibe to passerby's for a bit. Otherwise"
7731797,58473158,2016-01-02,12163927,Kim,"If you're planning a trip to Boston, stay here. This charming brownstone apartment along Newbury street will welcome you with a cosy interior, tons of natural light and very well designed layout."
Boutique shopping and high street brands are literally seconds away from the apartment. Copley Square and Brooklyn Public Library are minutes away.,,,,,
"Loved every bit of it. Thanks Flatbook!\"",,,,,
7731797,61652123,2016-02-07,53111211,Ibrahim,"This listing's description was very accurate. Excellent prime location. Best thing about flatbook is that they give you your privacy, but are around if anything goes wrong. Would definitely deal with flatbook again, thanks guys!"

7731797,65297347,2016-03-12,1460138,Salomon,"Extremely efficient airbnb with a key in the lockbox outside, so no need to coordinate in person. Central in one of Boston's best neighborhoods, clean, and as advertised"
7731797,65880851,2016-03-17,59072281,Grace,"This place was great! So clean and fully equipped with everything you could possibly need, and a fantastic area to stay in! I walked almost everywhere. I highly recommend a stay here. Great quality living space!"
7731797,76410825,2016-05-27,269528,Voytek,Easy check in a a real clean and cozy studio on a coolest street in back bay. Close to the subway and better than staying in the hotel. Coffee and tea provided as well as laundry det soap etc. highly recommended.

7731797,77472203,2016-06-01,11232351,Magni,The team at Flatbook was very responsive and helpful.  Access was easy and they were very accommodating with letting us drop pur bags hours before our checkin
7731797,77793214,2016-06-03,30808425,Chosita,Listing is very accurate. Apartment is clean and well decorated as shown in the photo. Very comfortable stay. The highlight of this accommodation is its location - right at the very heart of Boston's Newbury street -the most convenient location I could ever ask for! Be aware that the room is on the 4th floor with no elevator (this was not a problem for me and my mother though). The other big plus is Flatbook's attentiveness to guest's questions and request which makes our stay perfect.
7731797,78613084,2016-06-07,55593912,Bárbara,"Excelente anfitrión, muy atento, al llegar todo estaba preparado para recibirnos. Lo mejor, la ubicación, una zona hermosa rodeada de los mejores restaurantes y negocios. El departamento muy cómodo y muy bien equipado, en especial la cocina, tiene de todo y más! Lo único para mejorar es que la cama es un poco incómoda."
7731797,78776341,2016-06-09,76223597,David,"A welcome introduction to Airbnb. Based on this experience, I will certainly be staying here again when next in Boston and have now staring using Airbnb elsewhere. Thank you."
7731797,81921774,2016-06-25,6658587,Louise,We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment gave us plenty of space and was very comfortable. We had prompt and friendly responses from Flatbook when we got in touch. We'd stay here again if we return to Boston.
7731797,87719536,2016-07-21,33685917,Zeb,"Great location for the Hynes Convention Center, tons of good places to eat/drink/shop nearby, and a quick walk from Copley station. Not much in the way of personality, but clean, air conditioned, and with all the stated features. One nice bonus: the Internet was pretty speedy (consistently over 2 megabytes per second, and as high as 5, which is faster than 99% of hotels)."
7731797,88156077,2016-07-23,8017004,Paola,We booked this for four people and it was clearly described as having two separate beds (see reservations). It was also clearly described as being for 4 people.
When we arrived there,the apartment was clearly for only 2 people. No second bed,no sofa bed.  We contacted Flatbook and they indicated it was their mistake,and we were entitled to a full refund,with no cancellation fees.,
We left on the same day,July 21st,about 1 hr after we got in,and we found another solution for our stay in Boston. We put the key back in the keylock.,,
Needless to say,this was a major problem which I never had before with any AirBnb reservations.  Extremely disappointed,as we planned our entire vacation around staying in BackBay,,,
On top of that,I didn't hear anything back from Flatbook about getting a full refund.,,,,
Flatbook indicated they swapped the sofabed  with a sofa the day before our arrival. Now,this is a BackBay 4th floor with no elevator. The two sofa look identical in the pictures so this explanation doesn't seem right .,,,,
We expect a full refund as it was promised by the Flatbook team on the phone (Maya and Olivia).,,,,,
I highly recommend *not* to book from Flatbook in the future. Certainly we never will do it again. I am surprised that AirBnB that has such a good reputation,let them host properties on AirBnB.,,,,

7731797,90122847,2016-07-31,770528,Paul,"Very convenient location for shopping/tourist activities. Many restaurants nearby. The apartment itself is well appointed but wasn't fully cleaned when arrived. This plus ants, mosquitoes (not sure how they got in), and stuffy 4th floor heat in July (there is AC but it's pretty loud) made it a convenient but not particularly comfortable stay."
7731797,90843933,2016-08-02,46272643,Kieren,The apartment was exactly as described and photographed. It was clean and spacious. It is in an ideal location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.
7731797,91472175,2016-08-05,41698630,Amy,This was a gold standard Airbnb. The host emailed me beforehand with simple instructions on finding the key. The building is in great shape. The flat is exactly as the photo shows and actually better because of the well equipped kitchen. The location is terrific. Trader Joes and Peets coffee just around the corner. The host thought of everything and was responsive when we had an issue with the city shutting off that water one morning for road work.
7731797,92403764,2016-08-08,7408962,Mike,Great location to everything with easy walking access to whatever and where ever.
7731797,96003360,2016-08-21,17060371,Alessandra,"beautiful apartment, beautiful location. can't wait to come back!"
1321422,5820119,2013-07-17,7458009,Richard,The Carney Family graciously agreed to allow us to stay an extra night; it seemed that they are doing some redecorating. Their home was near a T station that allowed us to venture into Boston city relatively easily. The robes and slippers were a nice touch!
1321422,5990398,2013-07-25,7271821,Terry Marsh,By far our favorite place in Boston!! Understated elegance.Great hosts! A must! if you use Airbnb. You will NOT be dissapointed!!!
"\"",,,,,
1321422,6039329,2013-07-27,2488893,R,"Barney was very friendly and welcoming. It really helped that he is a native of Boston as he knows what the city has to offer and is very happy to share. The room was very comfortable, the neighborhood was safe and the metro station was only a 5 minute walk from their home. For me it's always fun staying in a neighborhood away from the main sites as you get to see parts of a city that you wouldn't normally have the opportunity to see - and the location isn't far from these sites either. I would definitely stay with the Carney's again!"
1321422,6166082,2013-08-01,7048574,Hans,"We liked our stay with the Carney family a lot. The hosts were really friendly and hospitable; they arranged an extra bed for us. The sleeping room is very spacious. Attached is a nice living room, kitchen and luxurious bathroom, which we had to share with two language students we hardly saw."
The house has a nice backyard with immediate access to the beachfront. The JFK library and a metro stop are nearby. The hosts connected us with their children who were performing in a restaurant in Provincetown,Cape Cod. We went to see them and had a lovely night.,,,,
"I would really recommend a stay at the Carney's during your next visit to Boston. \"",,,,,
1321422,6208326,2013-08-03,4414637,Vana,"The Carney residence is *beautiful*, very quiet, super clean and  most comfortable. The Carneys are among the nicest people I've ever met; they went above and beyond the call of airbnb hosts' duty, offering helpful advice for sightseeing, discount shopping and tire repair -  including help with finding the repair shop and a ride offer back to the house. Thank you so much, Mary & Barney! I will be back for sure!"
1321422,6327427,2013-08-08,13501894,Deborah,"This is a 5 star luxury accommodation except that wouldn't mean much to me unless the hosts were warm and helpful.  Well, these hosts are 5 star too.  They are very good people who have tried to think of everything a guest might require.  Even little sensor lights go on to guide you to the loo at night.  It is very comfortable and yes the water views are delightful.  It is a very special place with very special and beautiful hosts.  You must go there.  They are right near the train too.  Lovely kitchen for your own use.  We hope to visit again."
1321422,6473897,2013-08-13,3729042,August,There are several reasons why you stay at the Carney Family:
1) The price is far too low compared to what you get. We slept in a lovely and perfectly clean room with new towels,fresh bed linnen,bathrobes and even new slippers.,,,
2) The Carney Family is so kind and responsive to any request you might have.,,,,,
3) It is easy to get around Boston from here because the Savin Hill subway station is just nearby.,,,,,
4) The breakfest you can get a McKenna's - just near Savin Hill Station - is absolutely fanstastic. It's greasy but even if there is no room at the Carney Family,you should consider going there.,,,,
5) There is a good cup of coffee waiting for you in kitchen when you get up.,,,,,
6) When we arrived we welcomed by Barney who had some very good sugestions on where to go.,,,,,
All in all,"it was really nice laid back atmosphere that greeted us at the Barney family. And staying there difinitely improved our stay in Boston. This is by far the best experience we've had on AirBnB. \"",,,,
1321422,6686723,2013-08-21,6217883,Sunny,"The Carney Family were extraordinarily welcoming  and I could not have asked for more. Really enjoyed staying here - great hosts, great location, very clean, and well kept. Would go back in a heartbeat!"
1321422,6738842,2013-08-23,7821277,Brian,"The Carney's got our vacation off to a great start. Mary was waiting for us on the front porch when we arrived and gave us a very warm welcome into their home.  We met Barney as we were finishing our tour and helped ourselves to homemade cookies!   We had great access to the T, a large, comfortable room, and the best coffee in town.   The only wrinkle in our stay was some noise from others who were up earlier than us in the house, which led us to get up a bit earlier than we had planned.  Other than that, we had a fantastic stay with the Carney family.  One unexpected treat was the pleasant breakfast we shared with a couple from Australia. We shared stories and laughs over tea, coffee, and bagels.  A great place to stay in Boston!!"
1321422,6829680,2013-08-26,7786113,Fabrice,This was my first experience with Airbnb and definitely not the last. The Carneys were extraordinary. The room was great and everything was arranged for me and my friend to have a pleasant stay. Barney even took the initiative to help us finding things to do in or out of the city (thanks for the Blue Hills Reservation recommendation). The location of the house was just perfect (5-10 min walk from the subway station) in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. I definitely recommend this place.
1321422,6906514,2013-08-29,2853640,Ed,"Huge room, made up immaculately. High ceilings and Victorian beauty. Strongest recommendations to go."
1321422,7001692,2013-09-02,8292747,John,"Excellent accommodations, and Mary and Barney were very kind and helpful to us. I'd gladly stay there again!"
1321422,7044025,2013-09-04,7872951,Mabelene,"First thing about our stay that must be mentioned was the hospitality. We were made to feel very welcome, with the Carneys taking great care to explain the location of everything in the house."
We were told to help ourselves to whatever was in the fridge,and they even went out of the way to make muffins for us(delicious!),,,,
Secondly,the room and board.,,,,
The house is old but very well maintained. There is a sense of history that is almost palpable. The room was big and had most things you could possibly need,the only exception being a TV,but honestly,to us it was no loss. The bed was big and comfortable and the ambience made us feel relaxed.,,
Finally,the location.,,,,
The house is very well located,5-10min from the MBTA station. Downtown and most of the attractions are within a 30 minute journey. The neighborhood is quiet,safe and welcoming.,,,
All in all,we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.,,,,

Nous avons bien aimé notre séjour dans la maison centenaire des Carney.  Tout était correspondant à l'annonce sur Airbnb et le MasterBedroom très impressionnant,"propreté impeccable et les airs communes bien respectées.  Nous y retournerions sans  problème.   \"",,,,
1321422,7285126,2013-09-14,8545207,Heidi Marie,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I really lucked out with the Carneys. Barney and Mary are wonderful, kind, considerate hosts with a true gift for making guests feel at home. I adored their big old Victorian home on a quiet street in Savin Hill. My room was cozy, clean, well-decorated, and spacious. I also enjoyed sitting out on the big wooden porch out back in the evening. There is a great Indian restaurant up the street on Dot ave as well as a lot of good Vietnamese places. One of the highlights of my trip was my early-morning chats with Barney. He does indeed make the best cup in Boston, as well as great muffins. He is well-informed, tolerant and laid-back. I hope to be back (if I can snag a room because they are quite popular and rightly so!) Stay here and you will not be disappointed. The Carneys make Boston proud."
1321422,7371089,2013-09-17,8223776,Regina,"Lovely stay in an older, beautiful home.  Hosts were very attentive to our needs, but afforded privacy as well. Nice touches - access to kitchen to cook, if desired.  Coffee and delicious muffins waiting each a.m.  Robes and cozy towels.  Everything was clean and well organized.  Home is very well situated to access Boston by train (walk a few blocks to train) - a very short ride to the city center."
1321422,7481129,2013-09-22,7502815,Björn,"We had a wonderful three nights stay at the Carney Family's house in Dorchester, Boston. It was the grand finale of our honeymoon trip. The Victorian-style house (from 1840, I think) is beautiful and very roomy. Our room was cozy and comfortable, with free use of bath robes and slippers. At the time of our stay we were the only guests in this part of the house, so we had a full apartment with living room, fully equipped kitchen, bathroom, laundry room and a back porch all for ourselfs. There were orange juice, bagels, fruits, fresh coffee and selfmade muffins for breakfast. Also the location was just perfect. You can take a walk along the bay and the subway station is just a 5-10 minute walk away. The Red Line takes you in just 15 minutes to Downtown Boston and with only one transfer to the airport. Very easy!"
On our stay we met our host Barney,his son John and his neighbor Karen,who were all very friendly and helpful. If we return to Boston sometime,"we would definetly stay again at the Carney Family's house. This place gets an A+ from us and is highly recommended!!!\"",,
1321422,7518719,2013-09-23,2394467,Mary,"The Carney house is a magnificent place to stay.  The house is on a tree lined street of similiar houses and seems like an idyllic New England scene.  Our room was excellent and included the use of a shared little sitting room, kitchen, bathroom  and laundry.  Mary was very welcoming to us when we arrived and was helpful in answering questions about our trip into downtown Boston.  The house is so convenient to the T line and we left our car there to avoid having to drive into downtown.  We left early on our checkout day so didn't get a chance to have the famous muffins.  i hope we will stay there again as it was a great experience."
1321422,7654838,2013-09-28,8855336,Dave,My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay with the Carney Family. Mr. Carney provided all the information that we needed about riding the Red Line Train to Boston and nearby Harvard. The Carney home is located within walking distance of the Red Line so we parked the car and didn't use it until we left.
1321422,7816702,2013-10-04,8919418,Carina,We enjoyed our stay very much! The Carneys were really nice and we'd stay with anytime again.
1321422,7922233,2013-10-08,8636412,Jessica,"Carney family are very nice during our stay. John, the son greet us and introduce the room and facilities. We met Barney later that he provides some good suggestion of exploring Boston. We also had some interesting conversation with Barney and the other guests."
Barney baked muffins for the guests everyday that is a nice touch! Barney and Mary are very helpful during our stay. Karen,the neighbor who helps the house,is also very friendly and helpful.,,,
The bedroom and bathroom are clean and comfortable. It is also very thoughtful to have some extra towels in the bathroom for people to use. The location is convenient which is about 10 mins walk from the subway station.,,,,,

1321422,8083445,2013-10-15,8370866,Linda,My boyfriend and I were visiting Boston for the 1st time and we loved our stay with the Carney Family. Barney and Mary were warm and welcoming hosts. The room we stayed in was spacious and the kitchen and bathroom were very clean. The robes and slippers were a great touch. And the muffins and coffee were perfect!  For an added bonus the T station was an only short walk away. We had a fantastic stay and would definitely come back the next time we're in Boston. Thanks Carney Family!
1321422,9303687,2013-12-20,8344335,Mary,The Carney's home is comfortable and inviting. Close walk to the T in an interesting neighborhood near the shore. Very safe and a super-easy commute to downtown and Cambridge.
1321422,9324379,2013-12-21,10510411,Mora,"From the moment we arrived (much later than anticipated in the evening), Barney made us feel like family and not only greeted us kindly, but with a full history of the house and the area. You can see the pride with which he cares for his house."
Every room feels private,spacious and clean. It is just like staying in a top-notch B & B,but at a reasonable price Every last detail was accounted for,including the bath robes,slippers and water glasses in the room. Barney's promise of homemade muffins and orange juice was met and we lingered in the bright,open kitchen in the morning to enjoy them.
What a treat to stay here!!! We will definitely come back every time we are in the area.,,,,,
Thank you for such a wonderful stay.,,,,,

The carneys  have spared nothing to make our stay more enjoyable. They accomodated us with everything we need . The neighbourhood is very safe and close to the subway .

1321422,13060197,2014-05-19,966035,Susan,"Our stay at the Carney BNB was very nice.  It was very convenient to the Red Line and most importantly, to our daughters apt.  Also, the house is located so that you get a pretty view of the water and at the end of the yard you can walk to the park and the little beach."
"Did not see much of the hosts but we were very busy and out most of the time.  They were helpful and were very nice to contact us that we left a shirt behind. They held it for us to pick it up on our return to Boston 3 days later.  Very nice place.\"",,,,,
1321422,13615470,2014-06-01,12486310,Pritika,"I had an amazing stay at Carney's. The hosts are friendly and very meticulous. They made sure everything was proper from the kitchen needs to the bedroom needs. Also, they made us feel like we are at home. My parents had come for my graduation and they were pleased that I did not book a hotel and instead chose to stay here. I would recommend everyone to book a room if ever they plan to come to Boston and enjoy an enriching confortable experience."
1321422,13733762,2014-06-03,12326582,Anne Marie,"Our stay in Boston was great. Barney's Master Bedroom meets up to its standards. It is close to the Metro, ad Barney's advise of eating out was valuable."

The house is very nice and spacious and the Master Bedroom was perfect for the three of us. Everything was very clean and Barney's coffee is one of the best we have tasted so far. It made our mornings. Also very nice is the balcony of the house where you can enjoy the view of the garden and the little bay in the back of the house. The beachwalk was very nice for an evening walk. The connection to the centre of Boston and Cambridge is very easy by the red line (subway). And on top of all, we felt very welcome and were very happy to meet the members of the family. Thank you for all the advice you gave us for our visits to Boston and for everything else! We can recommend this air bnb 100%."
1321422,16133663,2014-07-22,14797392,Alessandro,"Staying at Mary and Barney's was just great. Their place is a beautiful mansion, just beside the seaside, in a quiet neighbourhood. Mary kindly gave me all the necessary instructions upon my arrival and made me feel at home. The house is walking distance to T station and only 10 minutes train to central Boston. It's perfect, whether you planned sightseeing or just chilling out. Would thoroughly recommend, and will definitely visit again in the future."
1321422,16211161,2014-07-23,14812487,Barbara,"The home was beautiful, the room was beautiful, and the whole kitchen and living room availability was fantastic. The other guests were very enjoyable to mingle with. So many of them brought in food from nearby markets and cooked quite a bit."
But for me,the best part of the stay there was Mary. I think Mary's one of the nicest people I've ever met,and she went out of her way to be gracious and kind,"and made my stay so very pleasant.\"",,
1321422,16313807,2014-07-25,17734947,Iryna,Great experience with this host. The room and other accommodations matched the description on the site. The location of the house is convenient to the Red line. Will stay with this host again once back in Boston.

Barney and Mary were extremely welcoming, and gave us a great restaurant recommendation when we got into town late on Saturday. The Carney’s provided us with a comfortable bed, bathrobes, slippers, fresh fruit, and Barney’s delicious homemade muffins every morning.  To say they met and exceeded our expectations is an understatement.  The house is beautiful, in a safe neighbourhood and a 7-10 minute walk to the T (red line).  Great location for going downtown, Cambridge, the Kennedy Library and Museum, and really any place you want to go in Boston.  This was our first Airbnb experience, and we couldn't have asked for anything more.  Thanks to Mary and Barney for everything, we had a fantastic stay and will come back the next time we’re in Boston!"

Breakfast is provided for the guests and Barney bakes fresh muffins everyday. We could meet Barney at night and he gave us really good suggestions on where to see, eat, etc. there is also a nice lady who takes care of cleaning (unfortunately I don't remember her name) that gave us a ride to show around the place. Actually everything was beyond our expectation, we enjoyed a lot our stay in Boston. Don't doubt to push the book button!"

The bathroom, kitchen and lounge were all spacious, clean and comfortable."

The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The kitchen allowed me to feed my tea addiction. I loved the homemade granola and muffins for breakfast. And the view from the back porch was beautiful. I also met some really great people in the house who were fellow travelers. I would highly recommend this room for anyone who loves traveling, but also enjoys the comforts of home."

I wasn't there, but I heard it was out of this world. And seeing that legalized slavery still existed in 1862, that Dead show must have been....oops I'm supposed to be reviewing the Barney experience. Three words: it rocks! Oops, that was two words. It super rocks!"

The room that we stayed in, Barney's master bedroom T downtown, was especially nice as it was very large, clean and close to the kitchen, laundry room and was located on the 1st floor (we had large luggage so this was great). Barney and Mary are very nice people, too. They were very obliging and took the time to answer our questions. Also, the muffins that Barney made were some of the best I have ever had. Highly recommend this place as it has a great combination of value, comfort and convenience."

Чудесная ванная комната, вкусный завтрак по утрам и абсолютно все, что нужно для комфортного пребывания. Конкретно эта комната находится прямо у входа в дом, из-за чего все время слышно входящих и уходящих, но если гуляешь целый день - то это совершенно не заметно"

Great location and beautiful old house.  The room was large and clean, but right next to the main entrance for the house.  If you go to bed early and/or are a light sleeper, bring earplugs or a white noise maker to block out the sounds of people coming into the house in the evening.  I am an early riser and was very happy to have the keureg coffee maker available, right near my room, to make my coffee before anyone else arose."

The room was clean. However, the bed is very squeaky, meaning that if the other person turns or moves, it gets really loud. Also, as some of the other reviewers said already, the bed is right next to the entry door of the whole building. During our night, we woke up a few times from people entering."

The room was large and spacious and while a safe is provided for valuables, there is no lock in the room, nor the doors to the house. So long as you are happy to keep your stuff in a suitcase, the room is good, as there is not much storage space. Very good coffee and granola are available for breakfast. It was very nice to have a kitchen in which we could cook and did not always need to eat out."

The room was large and very comfortable and the neighbourhood quiet. Breakfast was left in the fridge and kitchen for us to help ourselves to which was nice. We did a self check  and check out so we did not meet any of the Carney Family. We felt a little strange staying in someone's home without meeting our hosts.

Accommodation place is  exactly what the pictures display.  What should I say, if you were in the place, it is far more better than the pictures.  8-9 min easy walk to subway (called T in Boston), if you have the 7 days Boston T pass which called you USD20 for unlimited T and bus ride, you can also take one station to JFK T station and there you can find supermarket.  Thanks Barney and Mary to give me such good place to stay."
1321422,38472373,2015-07-15,23955228,Adam Michael,"We had a great stay! The room had everything we needed and was quite comfortable. The house was interesting, welcoming and accessible."
1321422,39608361,2015-07-25,31359768,Christiane,"Die Unterbringung war sehr gut, ebenso die Nachbarschaft. Die Informationen , die ich vorher von meinem Gastgeber hatte, haben alle gestimmt."
Es wäre schön gewesen,wenn meine Gastgeber mich etwas eingeführt hätten,mich rumgeführt hätten. Ich hatte von 6 Tagen nur an einem Tag warmes Wasser in der Dusche.,,,
Sonst war alls o.k.,und ich habe mich sehr wohl gefühlt.,,,,

1321422,39945275,2015-07-27,22904675,Florian,We had a geat time at the Carney's wonderful house. The room was spacious and comfortable. It's only a short train ride to the city centre but located in a quiet and nice area.
1321422,40302486,2015-07-30,21407229,Michael,Great place to stay. Very convenient and lovely hosts. House was amazing and room is so much bigger than any hotel. Really clean. Felt like home from home. The area is very safe.
1321422,40890941,2015-08-03,29565090,Miranda,"This location was perfect and the house was gorgeous. I would recommend this place to anyone.  I have never used this service before, but I will definitely do it again."
1321422,41404235,2015-08-07,11966042,Anne,"Staying in this beautiful house was great. Everything was clean and convenient, the indications were clear and once arrived, it's easy to get to the city center with the subway. Thank you for your hospitality!"
1321422,41935916,2015-08-10,8313319,Lee,"This is my second time in Barney's place, and it never disappoints! The master bedroom is very spacious. The bed is very comfortable. One day it was very hot so I took advantage of the air conditioning that is included in and controlled from the room."
The place is very charming,clean,and safe. Parking was no problem,even though I got back at 1am one night and 5:30am another night! It was also very relaxing to sit on the back porch sipping coffee and enjoying Mary's homemade muffin.,,
"Highly recommended for any guest!!\"",,,,,
1321422,42523537,2015-08-14,12223259,Kathy,"We really enjoyed our stay at Barneys and it was a great way to finish our 8 week holiday.  It was easy to find and not too far from the station to walk. Also easy to get to and from the airport with one change from the train (red line) to the airport bus (silver line). The location was really nice with lovely old period houses in a leafy neighbourhood.  The house was great, with plenty of room, a large sitting room and back verandah overlooking the garden to relax."
The bedroom was large with a bathroom off the kitchen area,just around the corner.  The use of the kitchen,fridge and laundry were very welcome.  Barney was very helpful with our requests and we really appreciated his help. Breakfast provided was plentiful and very much appreciated. Highly recommend staying here,"it was most enjoyable. \"",,
1321422,43359440,2015-08-19,33053574,Heidi,This is a lovely big house in a charming and quiet neighborhood about a five minute walk from the nearest metro station.  The room is big and comfortable even with an extra bed in the corner. The extra bed was very comfortable.
Breakfast was simple but exactly what we like to eat including fresh home made muffins each morning. There was room in the fridge for us to have food and the kitchen was at our disposal.,,,,,
Barney is very chatty,helpful and informal. I got clear instructions on how to check in before I arrived and there was a sheet of useful information in our room like nearby restaurants,grocery stores and taxi services. Barney was happy to make additional recommendations when we had questions.,,,
"I would be very happy to stay here again!\"",,,,,
1321422,44545672,2015-08-27,5468099,Antonio Jose,"The room we stayed is very large, beautiful and comfortable.I not met Barney but he promptly answered all my questions. The Girleide, who made our check in was very helpful with us. The house is a short walk from the subway."
1321422,45077546,2015-08-31,35439955,Gregory,"The Carney's were fantastic hosts. The accommodations were very comfortable. We had a late night arrival, and Mary sent good instructions, left us water on the mantle, and delicious muffins in the kitchen. We love the Savin Hill neighborhood. Very beautiful, and close to the T and the JFK Library. Mary and Barney have a beautiful home, which they graciously and unobtrusively share with their guests. We'd stay there again in a minute."
1321422,45462758,2015-09-03,4543449,Roger,"Great location, - close to T line, Great  in house facilities, Great breakfast, Great house in a fantastic old neighbourhood, (the tallest ceilings imaginable), Great city with the absolute best amenities to suit all tastes, whats not to like?"
1321422,45789456,2015-09-06,37572441,Cory,"I stayed with the Carney's in September 2015. It was a very enjoyable stay. They are a 10 minute walk from the T (Boston subway). The room was clean and tidy and they even left water in the room for you. They provide a safe which was a plus. The kitchen had a fridge, coffee (provided by the Carney's), and dishes. Also provided muffins every morning which was a wonderful plus. I would suggest this stay for anyone wanting to see Boston but not pay $300+/night at a hotel."
"Thank you Carney's!\"",,,,,
1321422,46272957,2015-09-09,35650869,Claire,"We absolutely loved our stay with the Carney Family!  The location is fantastic, close to the train station, and nice places to eat... Although we didn't meet Barney, we did meet Mary and she was lovely and she gave us some great suggestions for our stay. We also met some lovely fellow travellers staying at the house. The entire experience was fantastic and we would absolutely stay here again and would recommend them as well."
1321422,46584980,2015-09-12,36227909,Marie,"Barney welcomed me as i arrived, the street was round the corner from a small river and lovely to sit and watch. The walk is about 10 minutes from the Tube station and is easy access into town. The hosts were very helpful with communication and sending me instructions. They also had information on tourism in Boston which was great as i went to Salem which i didn't consider doing before."
1321422,47094910,2015-09-15,4134624,Brooke,"This is a  clean, nice house in a cute neighborhood. However, I wish they had locks on their doors as many people stay here at one time and we had a theft issue here."
1321422,47228696,2015-09-16,44053702,Miel,"I stayed in Barney's Master Bedroom with the Carney Family for a one day visit to Boston in September 2015. I was welcomed by Mary and was given a short tour of the rooms that were available to me. Furthermore, Barney and Mary were very helpful with their instructions before my stay, and the room and bathroom were very clean. And most important, the bed was very comfortable and helped me to sleep off the jet lag from my Transatlantic flight. If I return to Boston in the future, I would certainly consider staying there again!"
1321422,47275174,2015-09-17,18977471,Emily-Jane,"The house was lovely. I stayed in the Master Bedroom, which was very spacious with high ceilings and lots of windows. It was as clean as one would expect, and I arrived to a pitcher of water and instructions on the mantle on how to access WiFi, taxis, etc."
It was my first time sharing a washroom,and while it is not my personal preference to walk through a common area to get to one,there were no issues and it was available when I needed it.,,,
I never actually met my host Barney,though he was incredibly helpful in our messages. He provided plenty of directions and was proactive in contacting me. I did briefly encounter Mary,who had a rather loud speaking voice,but who was very friendly.,,
I felt safe in the neighbourhood. It's about a ten minute,rather scenic,walk to the subway which took you just a few stops into Boston's downtown area.,,,
"I would recommend this listing.\"",,,,,
1321422,47965933,2015-09-22,36641645,Jan,"It was one of the most amazing rooms I've ever stayed in. Location was quiet but with superb access to city centre. Place was spacious. Totally clean. Barney is really friendly person and great host. His muffins were ready for us every morning and we wouldn't leave one! We loved the veranda, where you could sit and chill out. The living room where you sit and chill out. The beds where you could slouch and, well, chill out:-). We also made some great friends during our stay and were realy enjoying the time in Boston which was great deal thanks to Carney's family hospitality."
1321422,48272571,2015-09-25,36377480,Keri,The host was there to welcome us as we arrived about 8pm but they do work and are gone during the day. We felt safe walking in the neighborhood.
1321422,48688500,2015-09-28,36883246,Rosi,"Barney war der perfekte Gastgeber. Seine Muffins am Morgen und Mary's Granola haben uns gefreut. Sehr praktisch war der PC mit Drucker und Internetanschluss, der den Gästen zur Verfügung stand."
1321422,49444501,2015-10-04,12825277,Yannan,"非常舒适、整洁,每天都可以在很安静的环境中休息,很棒。离地铁战走路不到10分钟,出行也比较方便。"
1321422,49978318,2015-10-08,2179584,Betsy,"\"The Carney's have a beautiful old home in a quiet residential neighborhood.  They are great communicators and made us feel welcome on our arrival as well as being available to us (but not intrusive) if we had any questions.  The home is very clean and convenient to the \"\"T\"\" subway system.  We walked to the JFK Library around Dorchester Bay and used the cab they recommended to get to the airport early in the morning.  They have incorporated many processes to make their guests visits work seamlessly and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Thank you Mary and Barney.\""
1321422,50283114,2015-10-11,7470341,Elvira,Now I know why the hosts called themselves CarneyFamily: you don’t feel like a guest but like a long distance family member coming for a visit. You share the house with other long distance family members you haven’t met before what otherwise would happen only at weddings and funerals. I felt strange at the beginning being more used to hotels. Staying at the CarneyFamily couldn’t be more opposed and was exactly what I was looking for. The house may be a little bit tired around the edges but who cares when it is a home. It is very clean with a warm and welcoming as well a peaceful atmosphere. Thank you Mary and Barney for your hospitality and the delicious muffin for breakfast.
1321422,50839244,2015-10-15,30529169,Gayle,"The listing was accurate. The room was comfortable with a separate shared bathroom. The layout was a little unusual though as you had to walk through the shared kitchen / living area to reach the bathroom. The location was in a pretty suburb of Boston. Younger people might prefer to stay right in the bustle of the centre, but as we were travelling with a young child we weren't planning on late nights out. This location turned out well as it was considerably cheaper than staying in the centre but only a 20min train journey away from Boston Common in the centre. We didn't really see much of our hosts apart from a brief meeting."
1321422,50999277,2015-10-16,44470213,Adam,"Barney made sure we found his place easily, and allowed us to park our car earlier on in the day, which was really appreciated."
The shower was nice and hot,and we were even able to get some laundry done while we were there.  The night was peaceful and quiet.,,,,
The only concern we had was that the bedroom was right by the front door,and so we were able to easily here people leaving in the morning.,,,,
Lovely breakfast and coffee was provided,which was another bonus.  We didn't get to meet the family,but the communication was always there.,,,
"Overall a nice stay.\"",,,,,
1321422,51364638,2015-10-19,45870599,Masato,"The master bedroom at Barney's place was charming, clean and spacious. The place was fairly close to the train station and thus accessible. Barney was friendly and helpful. It was a little cold at night as there was no heat but was not a big problem, and I wish there was a key to the room as there were other guests sharing the place."
1321422,51475220,2015-10-20,45323009,Hui-Ching,"The location is great, very convenient. We enjoyed our stay very much! It's very comfortable, and the room is very big. The host provided many things for us to use, even the hand-made muffins! The host is really kind, making our trip in Boston more perfect!"
1321422,51697936,2015-10-24,22218234,Mary Kay,Savin Hill is a wonderful location..nice neighborhood and comfortable getting around without a car. Walk along Harbor Walk was a real bonus... we enjoyed several times.
Subway to Boston and beyond very easy to navigate!,,,,,
Mary and Barney are easy going and great hosts. Delicious muffins and granola a treat in the morning.,,,,,
Rooms and kitchen are very clean all is well managed.,,,,,

1321422,52256788,2015-10-27,37550048,Iracema,Infelizmente fIquei apenas uma noite na casa. Digo infelizmente pois gostei muito da casa e da localização mas não pude ter o prazer de conhecer meus anfitriões pessoalmente.
Mary e Barney foram bastante atenciosos antes mesmo de eu chegar à casa pois preocuparam-se em fornecer orientações detalhadas para que eu não tivesse nenhum problema para encontrar a casa.,,,,,
De manhã pude provar o muffin feito por Barney e realmente estava muito gostoso.,,,,,
Caso eu vá a Boston outra vez,gostaria de ficar lá novamente.,,,,
Mary and Barney. Sorry for post in Portuguese but I don't have enough confidence to express myself in English.,,,,,
I loved your house and it was really a shame we didn't have met in person...,,,,,

It was great having access to a full kitchen (the one on the main floor is really only for guests) as we had fresh fruit, yogurt, and pancakes each morning that we made.  Barney and Mary were always available for help (either in person or by phone or text) and having a printer was very handy.  About a 5-8 minute walk to the Red Line (subway) with very easy access to downtown.  Thanks for a great stay !!"
"\"",,,,,
1321422,52743831,2015-11-01,33856196,Andy,"The place was very easy to get to via the train and the host provided thorough instructions for finding our room itself in their absence and remained very communicative over messaging before, during, and just after our stay (while we stored our luggage at the house to go exploring Boston after checking out but before our departing flight)."
"This house is beautiful and old. Both Mary and Barney were sweet and informative. The coffee was excellent and the home was clean and relatively quiet aside from the few hours that Mary was humoring trick-or-treaters on the front porch :)\"",,,,,

They are considerate and could think about every details about a guest such as there is not only hand wash but also hand wash lotion after you washing your hand. I enjoy every moment stay at the warm house:) I wish to come here again:)
1321422,53182911,2015-11-06,33263238,Ornusa,"We love the place, beautiful house nice area  to stay. Walking distant from train, not far from downtown and airport. Mary and Barney is very nice. At first we thought we had to catch a cab from airport to the house but Barney told us clear direction of how to travel to the house by train and it's free too. Also Barney bakes delicious muffin. You should try it!!! The best muffin I' ve ever had."
1321422,53363792,2015-11-08,42916587,Ling-Mei,We were there shortly but Barney did come by first and second day made sure everything was good and that we had the amazing muffins in the am before or race!

Besides I could use facilities such as fridge shower include towel. Although this was my first time to use Airbnb, this family gave me detailed instruction."

It takes 7 minutes to the red line metro station by walk,and you can go lots of places with red line. You can eat some home-made bread and coffee,"too. \"",,,
1321422,56879463,2015-12-19,50769054,Tom,This was my first time staying in a Bed and Breakfast  and I have to say the bar is now set very high.  I felt very comfortable with all aspects of the home and my room.  The bathroom and shower and kitchen were all very clean.  Neighborhood is very quiet and I felt secure with parking my car on the street.  My wife had stayed here before and also had a very good experience.

1321422,58199815,2016-01-01,20525374,Ada,We loved Barney's master bedroom! It was very spacious and elegant. Muffins and granola were delicious. The house was only 10 minutes walking to red line.
1321422,58448728,2016-01-02,16931360,Matheau,"I had a great time in Barney's Master Suite. The house is indeed in a charming section of Boston. I was only there for a quick overnight and ran into Barney and Mary briefly as they were heading out, but all the preparation (emails, texts, clean open space with coffee, tea, granola, sitting area) made me feel right at home. Hopefully I'll get to stay longer on a future visit!"
1321422,59110495,2016-01-07,4233125,Enrica,"The neighbourhood is lovely. We enjoyed meeting Mary but never met Barney. Their home is beautiful. The Airbnb is like a hotel / hostel with lots of people coming through which was a bit much for us - especially late in the evenings. We loved the local architecture and the historic home. Nice generous touches such as shampoo and body wash, a coffee machine with good pods on our floor (3 floors of rooms),lovely muffins each morning. Juice if you get to it in time, and some apples. The house is on the red line subway which got us to Harvard, the centre, the aquarium and close to the Kennedy museum. Very handy. Lovely area and friendly and helpful locals. The home has a basketball ring which our children loved each morning!  There are cleaners almost daily so the share bathroom and kitchen are always clean. Thanks!"
1321422,59261487,2016-01-08,21455210,Joshua,The room was wonderful and clean. The kitchen was fully stocked for basic cooking. Muffins and granola were a great touch. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Dorchester.
1321422,59604178,2016-01-12,6382700,Christiane,"Staying at the Carney Family's very well appointed Victorian B&B makes me want to come back to Dorchester/Boston, just to enjoy another stay at this lovely house in a great location.  Having been an innkeeper and B&B owner in southern Vermont for 7 years, this is how a B&B should be run for guests to have a memorable and positive experience.  Barney's Master Bedroom was so comfortable and spacious that I had a difficult time leaving today:)"
It was perfect for me as I appreciated the privacy of my bedroom,but the common area,including the living room and the well-stocked kitchen with delicious breakfast items. Mary's home-made granola and Barney's home-made breakfast muffins were most delicious.,,,
Next time when I'll be in town for a conference,to visit Harvard University (since your place is conveniently on the red subway line stops),or just to enjoy Boston with family visiting from Germany,"I 'll be sure to stay with you again.  Thank you for being such great hosts and providing such a nice accommodation for guests.\"",,

LOVED the freshly baked muffins in the morning. The neighborhood was quiet and it was a very easy 5-7min walk to the nearest train station."

Thank you Barney and Mary for your kind hospitality. I will miss the muffin and smell of fresh flowers! I'm happy with everything also how close your place is to downtown it's so convenient! The house is always in a pristine condition. It was a pleasure staying there. Thank you so much. Love from jay
1321422,70734324,2016-04-20,9924951,Jenny,"Wonderfully clear directions for self check in to this awesome traditional Boston Victorian home. A very comfortable space- I felt very at home here - childhood memories of a similar large old home that I grew up in with its lovely tall ceilings, polished balustrades up to the top floor. And the self serve breakfasts were great. Fresh fruit, tea/coffee, homemade Granola and yoghurt and the homemade muffins of course! Great job Carneys! Very enjoyable stay!"
1321422,71294416,2016-04-24,49357191,Cherryl,My first AirBnB experience and it was a complete success. The muffins in the morning were delicious as was the yogurt orange juice and granola that was all provide! It was a quiet stay and every was as it was supposed to be. I would definitely stay here again.

1321422,71898873,2016-04-29,40651868,Harry,"I have stayed with the Carneys many times in the past, but this was my first time staying at Barney's Master Bedroom.  The bedroom is very comfortable and beautiful (there is even a fireplace in the room). Barney and Mary's home-made muffins and granola are delicious, and the house is a five-minute walk from the T-station in a residential Boston neighborhood."
1321422,73057268,2016-05-06,38494742,Briege,Stayed in this house for a week in the Master bedroom. The room itself had lots of room and a good sized double bed. House was beautiful and very relaxing. Loved the coffee and muffins in the morning. Very convenient to the T-Station as it was only about a 5 minute walk away.
1321422,73164619,2016-05-07,14559405,Rubén,Cosy and big room in a typical boston house.

1321422,74677660,2016-05-16,56917985,Brittany,Lovely 5-day stay at the Carney Family house. No problems and very clean. It's in a nice neighborhood and reasonable walking distance to the train station.
1321422,75000289,2016-05-18,69719856,Mark,We stayed again in another room which was perfect once again. The owner accompanied us for a late check out too which was a great convenience for my family.

1321422,77966037,2016-06-04,59102888,Darrell,"Barney met U.S. and showed us around the entire house, including where they live. We were shown all the amenities and provided with advice on attractions, public transportation &a entertainment. The century plus house has so much character and is well maintained. The neighbourhood is very picturesque and quiet"
1321422,78463346,2016-06-06,66678023,Changmin,"The house was really nice, and I really loved the muffins, granola, coffee, and etc. provided for us. The location was fairly close to the subway station so it was easy to get to the center of Boston and travel around. It was the best airbnb experience I had."
1321422,78851210,2016-06-09,54857052,Fiona,Had a wonderful 3 night stay with the Carney Family in Dorchester. Their home is so welcoming and full of old world charm. The location of this beautiful home is excellent close to the beach and train station and we could be in central boston within 15 minutes. The area was residential and we got a great feel for life in Boston. Barney and Mary are very hospitable and their breakfast muesli and muffins were amazing. They give full use of their laundry room which is a godsend when you are travelling. Would highly recommend this family and should we visit Boston in the future we will definitely stay there. Overall a wonderful experience
1321422,79891550,2016-06-14,44746143,Shawnee,"We were welcomed with kindness. Super clean and cute. Accommodated our children well. Lots of extra touches with nice towels, robes and slippers, and water. Easy and convenient. Lovely setting near the water."

1321422,80620071,2016-06-19,4841329,Laura,"Another positive stay at the Carney family home. The ability to park my car, have use of a full kitchen , clean & comfortable room with AC and conveniently located close to Savin Hill red line station not to mention the friendly owners is the reason I'll continue to come back."

1321422,83931077,2016-07-04,39705878,Cheng,"Barney's master bedroom is one of the rooms in his well equipped beautiful yellow house. The freestyle house rule impressed me deeply. Every door was unlocked and all guest are free to walk in and leave. Living with Barney in Dochester rather than central Boston is just great, if you want to avoid the crowd and tourist. I experienced the American neighborhood and also enjoy the every advantage in Boston by 20 mins with subway. In one word, I like it very much and I recommend it without hesitate. 非常干净,如果想体验美国人的社区生活,我很推荐!"
1321422,84697698,2016-07-08,54453709,Melanie,I only met Mary who was very friendly and welcoming. Great instructions were given prior to arrival and self check in was very easy.
The house has very good amenities and backs onto a beach and walkway. Easy walk to transport into the city - about 10 mins and cafe and bar.,,,,,

1321422,91529997,2016-08-05,41774494,Daima,I can not find the words to express how wonderful our time was in Boston!  It was our first time and staying with the Carney's made our trip that much more enjoyable.  Barney and Mary were welcoming and wonderful hosts!  The home was beautiful and the neighborhood was wonderfully Bostonian!  We were a few steps from the beach and few blocks from the train that would take us into town.  We would absolutely stay again!
1321422,92746869,2016-08-09,10676173,Mattia,"Everything was clean, easy and friendly. We got all the information we needed beforehand and the Stay was very pleasent. With the subway its not that far from the center."
1321422,93408332,2016-08-12,42533060,Jay,"Barney's was the best Airbnb we ever stayed in. The house is situated at a very beautiful location and has a welcoming warmth to it. The hosts were responsive and very considerate of our needs. Super clean, quiet locality with greenery all around to make you feel at home. I'd love to stay here again on my next trip to Boston."
1321422,95269800,2016-08-19,5424716,Carole,"We had a great experience. It was a special treat to sit on the back porch, enjoying our tea and the evening breeze. It was as an experience as described. Lovely neighborhood, easy walking distance to the T. The communication with the host was very thorough and hospitable."
"Would love to return on another trip.\"",,,,,
1321422,97556607,2016-08-27,53259163,Anne,"Der Aufenthalt in Barney's Master Bedroom war ohne Einschränkungen wunderbar, das Zimmer, die Umgebung, die Erreichbarkeit der Innenstadt von Boston. Besonders angenehm wurde es durch unsere Gastgeber, die uns offen empfangen haben. Wir können diese Unterkunft nur wärmstens empfehlen. Und auch wenn es schon oft gesagt wurde, die Muffins waren exzellent."
4132983,20782907,2014-10-05,21493238,Jitjaree,"Heskel From Churchill Suite was very helpful and quick in response.  I was urgently trying to find an apartment in Boston during its high season in fall; most of the apartments in center of Boston from most agencies were all booked up. However, Heskel From Churchill finally managed to find one for us very quick which made us so relief."
The apartment was exactly what was described.  The location was superb,right in the center of Boston as what we were looking for; it took less than 5 minute walk to Copley Place and Prudential where we could find almost everything there -- foods,shopping,big supermarket near by,pick up spot for the Boston Duck Tour.  So close to Newsberry St. and Bolyston St. where one could find boutique shops,fine restaurants
Even though it was located in the city's center,the apartment had a private atmosphere in a quiet residential area-- no sound of traffics and community.   The apartment is spacious,clean and provided us with every things we would need such as clean towels,toiletries,extra blankets and pillows,strong wifi and kitchen utensils. There was an indoor parking space assigned for us upon our request; it's USD.40 per night.
"We had a very pleasant stay and definitely will come back to rent the place again next time we visit Boston.\"",,,,,
4132983,21311475,2014-10-14,21940481,Kevin,"Everything was just as described.  Great area, very close to everything--shopping, restaurants, etc."
4132983,22304814,2014-11-03,15335185,Geneviève,"We stayed at Churchill during a conference at the Marriott Copley place. It was everything we could have ever wanted: super clean rooms, a super well equipped kitchen, a washer and dryer and extra blankets and pillows. There was even a set of toiletries in the bathroom, which was great because I had forgotten my toothbrush. An added bonus was that our conference was a 30 second walk. The staff was super helpful and friendly. I can't recommend this place enough if you're thinking of going to Boston. It made our stay really memorable. Thanks for everything!"
4132983,34804909,2015-06-12,29595003,Rebekkah,"The apartment is managed by a company, so for the most part the check in and check out process was simple, but I wouldn't say there was anything to make me feel welcome. The apartment is as described and the pictures are mostly accurate. The neighborhood is lovely and very close to the Back Bay Station and the Hynes Convention center."
Overall the apartment is as pictured,however it is not well maintained.  For example holes in the wall have been patched- but not painted over,the towel rack in the master bathroom was broken- small things like that. While not a big deal,for $570 a night I'd expect a bit more. Also you have until 11am to leave the apartment. At 10:30am on departure day,"2 maintenance guys came by claiming they needed to caulk around the shower. I said asked if they could come back a little later because I was getting dressed and finishing up. They seemed kind of insistent and as a single woman alone in the apartment- it made me feel uncomfortable. Luckily I wasn't around for much longer.  \"",
4132983,46647115,2015-09-12,7183096,Evan,"This place is great. Its in a super neighborhood, close to shopping, Boston Commons, and more. The house is managed by a management company, and everything was good with that, but it doesn't have the same feel as a personal host. House is clean. It's a little barren (seems like a corporate apartment) but everything was clean and in order."
4132983,52579083,2015-10-31,12754602,Paz,We had a great time in the Garrison Apartments. The location is great; you are in the hub of the city yet the apartment wasn't too noisy for they don't face the street. Its a nice and quiet apartment and the host made us feel welcomed by leaving thing we might need immediately at arrival at our disposition. The listing description was accurate and you could not ask for a better neighborhood.
What I would have liked though if for a better equipped kitchen,specially since it was a one month stay where we wished to cook for ourselves rather than going out every day. (For people who stay just a few days it shouldn't be an issue.) There were no toppers,no pirex's,"nor serving/cooking utensils. \"",,
4132983,53223800,2015-11-06,6837980,Hannah,"Great location, great apartment! Fit all of our needs. Move in instructions were clear and comprehensive! Will stay again!"
4132983,55311069,2015-11-29,49839525,Xiao,"The apartment was even better than I expected. Everything I needed was provided in there. The location is perfect too. A beautiful, cozy, 2-bedroom apartment at probably one of the best locations in Boston with an affordable price? What can I ask for more? I'm feeling very lucky and happy to have chosen this place for a stay."
4132983,55741734,2015-12-05,49431721,Chris,This was a nice place.  Basicly across the street from the convention center.  I would recommend this place over the nearby hotels any day.
4132983,58676123,2016-01-03,31790862,Audrey,"Mike was very nice, available and flexible upon my inquieries. The checkin information and procedure is very precise and easy to follow. It is a very good location; the neighborhood is beautiful, calm and pretty close from everything by walk (restaurants, bars, other neighborhoods)."
The only downsides are:,,,,,
1- thought we would have the apartment for wich I had read the listing,for wich I inquired about,and for wich I made the reservation,but it was not. The description said there were a fireplace,2 double beds and 1 sofa bed,and that was perfect for us since we were two couple and one single person. I even inquired especially about the bed for the fifth person
2- To my opinion,it would really help visitors if the parking information and procedure were added to the listing. We were told parking was available on premises,for a price,and that all could be arranged at the concierge desk. Upon arrival,we learned that the payment was only possible with a check or a money order,wich you don't always have on you when you travel... Let's just say it is not very convenient as payment method
Despite those 2 downsides,"we had a really great trip and the apartment fitted our needs about everything else!\"",,,,
4132983,59849601,2016-01-16,3882704,Paul,"This apartment is in a terrific location in Back Bay: short walk to Back Bay station, Copley and Prudential centre.  The apartment is in a complex of modern, secure and well kept apartments.  Very comfortable and well appointed: exactly as described.  Check in and out was easy and Mike was very communicative and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again.  Wonderful."
4132983,62758059,2016-02-16,18102525,Andrew,"Mike was very easy to get in contact with and very helpful with any questions. The location was ideal, and is within walking distance of many attractions/restaurants/shopping that Boston has to offer. The apartment itself was very clean, spacious, and the amenity baskets provided were a nice touch. Although the apartment we stayed in was not the exact apartment shown in the pictures, it was very similar. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone else looking to visit Boston."
4132983,64112202,2016-02-29,57643858,Kim,We stayed in this apartment for 9 days. It was a central location and we walked everywhere.  Our apartment faced an inner courtyeard and that made it very quiet from street sounds.
The apartment was clean,spacious with lots of closets.,,,,
"It made for a perfect home for our stay. \"",,,,,
4132983,64807833,2016-03-08,19495222,Lynne,"\"The apartment was fairly clean. The building itself and the apartment complex was very nice and the staff of the complex were also very helpful. There was no contact with the host, but there were very clear and specific directions regarding check-in and check-out. There were very lovely and useful \"\"gift bags\"\" for both kitchen and bathroom use"
4132983,68099123,2016-04-02,19104638,Chris,I didn't speak with Mike at all.  The directions provided before our visit covered everything we needed.  The location is more of a corporate housing situation.  Great for our family of 5.  We did not have the unit in the pictures but our apartment had the same layout.  Our unit appeared a little more... dated than the pictures.
The good:,,,,,
Centrally located to just about everything you'd want to visit in Boston.  Every uber ride was less than $20.,,,,,
Walking distance to a grocery store.,,,,,
Clean apartment when we arrived.  Everything worked well enough (shower had water pressure,washer and dryer okay,oven and microwave worked,etc.),,
Safe neighborhood.,,,,,
Quite building,couldn't hear anyone else.,,,,
Could be improved:,,,,,
The building is an older building and it shows.  There were small issues that you wouldn't want to have to deal with during a shorter stay.  For example: the door to the bathroom in the master bedroom wouldn't close because the hinge had fallen.  The toilets didn't flush well.  The caulk in the shower had come off.  The unit looked like it needed a handyman to spend a day there fixing little odds and ends.  There was supposed to be a security guard at the entrance who we saw twice in the 6 days we were there.,,,,,
Overall a good experience for us and it accomplished what we needed.  Would I recommend this rental? Yes.  Would I use it again? Probably not.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4132983,78562125,2016-06-07,44383891,Paul,"The unit provided was not similar to the pictures posted during our reservation including one less bathroom, no outdoor patio and not properly functioning Internet and tv.  The overall unit quality was significantly less than the one we believed we reserved.  No real assistance from the local Management Staff and the Host did not respond to multiple requests for assistance.  We were however assisted by a very skilled, friendly and generally wonderful Airbnb Help Desk Representative.  Our desire to continue to utilize Airbnb was saved by her professionalism and continued support.  We should have been warned regarding the unit change by the Host prior to arriving allowing us to decide to stay or seek others choices.  At the price of this unit it should have at least met or exceeded our expectations which it did neither.  Thank you Airbnb Staff for properly resolving this for us."
4132983,91972329,2016-08-07,65085246,Jonathan,"This is a great spot to experience the Back Bay and South End. It's a super convenient apartment to shopping, food and the city overall.  The apartment is quite functional and very secure.  The concierge was always quite friendly as well.  There were nice toiletry packs, lots of clean towels and some basic paper goods and household items along with a fully equipped kitchen (pots, pans, utensils, etc...)"
1071144,6202248,2013-08-03,2417892,Ed,"Small but perfectly formed and in a great area.  I was travellng alone, working in Boston for the week and found it met all of my needs. Close to the convention centre, a block away from restaurant row, there's a 7-11 close by and wine store next door. The apartment is compact, really well maintained and as I said, met my needs."
11431331,65871425,2016-03-17,27816836,Liang,"The place is near a subway station and a bus stop, which is great. It locates at the very center of the city so you get lots of shops and restaurants in walk distance. The concierge took  care of everything so we didn't meet the host in person. There was only one bed in the house but with a sofa bed, we actually fitted in 4 people. Everything was fine and we had a great time in Boston."
11431331,68421633,2016-04-04,11047526,Arvi,"Perfect location, close to convention centre. The apartment is almost brand new, and very clean.

11431331,78991764,2016-06-10,66815394,Anita,"I had a great experience with my 1st Airbnb experience at this Compass apartment at 1085 Boylston St., Boston. During booking, Adam answered to my inquiries very promptly. The check in process was smooth & easy, and the staff whose name is Cristiane is very friendly & helpful. I stayed there for 10 days with my son after his knee surgery for recovery, we stayed inside the apartment most of the time and it feels like home. The apartment was very clean and neat like new when we checked in. The furniture, bedding, and utilities in the kitchen and bathroom are all very new. There is a TV in the living room and the bedroom, which comes with cable and a DVD player. Iron & ironing board, vacuum cleaner & hair dryer are provided too. The bed was fairly comfortable, however since it is beside a highway, you do hear cars and trains passing by; it didn’t bother me and my son, but it might be a slight problem if you are an extremely light sleeper. The bathroom came with everything needed including towels, shampoo & soaps. The kitchen utilities provided are definitely enough to cook most meals. They are very thoughtful to provide kitchen towel, washing sponge, washing soap & dishwasher detergent. There are multiple washing machines and dryers in the building for use. Overall the apartment felt very homey and has everything you need to live in for long periods of time. I parked my car in the basement parking lot with a $20/day fee, a good deal! The location is great! There are plenty restaurants right across the street, and more with a 5 to 10 minute walk down Boylston or Newbury Street, Prudential Center is 10 minutes away. Supermarket & pharmacies are all within walking distance."
To conclude: Great location! Extremely homey,and has everything you need. But it might take a day or two to get used to the noises from the cars and trains on the highway outside.,,,,

The good is that the apartment is conveniently within walking distance to plenty of restaurants, Fenway Park, Newbury Street, Hynes Convention Center, and subway station. We liked how late-night food options were right across the street. The bad about the location is that it's situated right next to the highway and train tracks. Our particular unit, #104, was on the first floor directly facing the highway and tracks (not overlooking lively Boylston Street as seen in the description photos). The cars passing on the highway were not that bothersome but the sound of the train and its vibrations were. In fact it woke up our 10-month old baby each time it passed during the night because the rumble could be felt. Perhaps higher units or units facing the street do not have this problem. If I had known, I would've definitely requested a different unit. That problem aside, everything else was fine. The place was clean and well-stocked, although a few extra towels and back-up toilet paper roll would be nice. We received one roll for the 3 of us for a one week stay. The concierge did give us additional rolls when requested, but it's kind of inconvenient when you find out there's no backup when you need one the most. Free laundry and detergent was a nice touch. Concierge was extremely nice and helpful. I would stay at this apartment again, but would probably ask for a different unit."

My son and I were planning on a trip to Boston to see the Red Sox and Yankees play...after looking for hotels I was shocked out how expensive they were.  A friend had told me about Airbnb - at first I was skeptical - staying in others homes was a bit uncomfortable.  The surprise for us was that it was better than a hotel, clean, GREAT location (an easy walk to Fenway), near great shopping and restaurants, the staff was very  helpful and friendly...and of course Adam was extremely responsive.  I would definitely stay at this property again - I travel a lot and will definitely use this serve in the future...."

Free parking, close to some key shopping spots, and right next to a transit station that gets you into downtown Boston in fewer than 15 minutes.  The apartment is exactly what you want if you're out and about a lot, but it has what you need to settle in for the night too.  The air conditioner was much appreciated.  Gavin was easy to contact and left all the info we needed.  And the beach!  Only a 10 minute walk away, and the perfect spot to relax.  We loved it!"

It was exactly as pictured and Gavin was great about communication and making sure when knew how to find the apt. We LOVED being so close to a blue line stop. It was no trouble at all getting to/from the airport or to/from Boston central and I highly recommend the neighborhood. There's a delicious Colombian restaurant, El Paisa, just up the street, and the local Dunkin' Donuts was great for grabbing a quick breakfast before heading out for some site-seeing. The wifi, tv, and air conditioning all worked great and there was laundry in the building had we needed it. The apt was clean and comfortable!"
I considered giving this listing four stars instead of five,only because the bathroom is a bit outdated in how it looks,but ultimately,"the pros far outweighed the cons. The bathroom worked fine and the location and cost are hard to beat. Highly recommend!\"",,
5364137,43288091,2015-08-18,30800387,Michael,Place is exactly as described. Loved the location. Would stay here again and again. WIFI was slow but that was easily remedied by longing into a stronger unprotected signal.
5364137,44355133,2015-08-25,16173969,Marie-Charlotte,This apartment is ideally located in front of the Orient height station. It is really clean and the parking is a real plus. Check in and check out was very easy.

Everything about the listing was accurate, and the neighborhood was nice and felt safe and was really close to a waterfront park which was a good place to go jogging.  Super convenient as well, being so close to the train station, and was only a $20 cab ride back from downtown after the trains stopped running.   It wasn't right in the heart of a touristy or trendy area but that's what I liked about it!"
5364137,48782189,2015-09-28,42191874,Nick,"The apartment was great, exactly as pictured. The location right across from a blue line stop makes it worth your while.

Location is minutes from the airport and train is just across the street. Various food restaurants nearby, walking distance, definitely recommend El Paisa, which is right around the corner. Beach is close by as well. Gavin was great in responding to my questions immediately.  This was my first time using airbnb and visiting Boston, could not have asked for a better experience! Would Definitely consider staying here again."

Also right up the street from a Rite-Aid, Dunkin Doughnuts, and a few other little restaurants and grocery stores. Very clean and comfortable room. Equipped with all the amenities you'd need. The neighborhood and apartment both felt very safe. Minor background noise from other residence, but nothing major. Not super big, but holds two very comfortably. I would highly recommend this place!"
5364137,68881352,2016-04-07,45424271,Susan,Host was readily available at checkin. The place was clean but furniture and appliances were worn and the TV didn't work very well though the Wifi worked just fine.  Parking was right outside and always available.
5364137,69859818,2016-04-14,64833780,Kaitlyn,"\"This was a great little studio next to the T station. We stayed for 6 days and 5 nights. Gavin was super accommodating with our check in time, and everything was very clean and well stocked. I highly suggest using the T to travel to and from the airport; we had an issue with a cab driver who got lost and charged us $40 even though it's only two stops on the T from the airport - all because we didn't realize we needed to specify \"\"East Boston\"\" as our location. We have zero complaints about Gavin or this listing and would highly recommend. \""
5364137,70570265,2016-04-18,65609246,George,The description of the space was as disclosed. The convenience of being near the T is an asset as well as proximity to the downtown.
5364137,71097753,2016-04-23,33222649,Sara,The apartment was perfect for what we needed for our stay in Boston. It was just big enough for two people. The location was great because it was literally right across from the T station. The walls seemed a little thin because we could hear our neighbors but the noise wasn't enough to keep us awake at night. Gavin was flexible and easy to work with. We had a great time exploring Boston!!
5364137,71758576,2016-04-28,66467788,Raghav,"A cozy place near the tube that lives up to the images and description shared as part of the brief on Airbnb. What made the place unique were the small details and things that Gavin did, like the munchies in the refrigerator, he was also flexible with the checkout timing which was an added bonus. Detailed and prompt responses made our stay comfortable and would highly recommend to anyone visiting Boston for the first time, thank you!"
5364137,72588261,2016-05-03,15450432,Kellye,"Excellent value. Safe, fully-furnished, clean place across from the T station (5 min to airport, 10 min to downtown). Check in/out process was very easy. Gavin was flexible with our travel arrangements and adjusted check in/out time accordingly. Place is as described - small, cozy, adequate for cleaning up and getting a good night's sleep before starting another day full of adventure. It isn't a place I'd like to stay and hang out/relax all day due to its size and TV that appeared to be antenna/not cable, but it more than suited our needs."

We did not meet him in person, but he was always reachable and answered quickly. The connection to Downtown Boston was perfect with the train station located directly on the other side of the street. Unfortunately the TV did not work very well and there was no real supermarket in walking distance (only some small food stores which were pretty expensive). But these are just some small remarks, overall we enjoyed our stay very much and would come back anytime!"
5364137,82966973,2016-06-30,77573083,Rebecca,"The good: wonderful location right across from the train station, nice neighborhood, listing is as it says, toiletries and other random items are in the bathroom for use, host responds in a timely manner, cheap parking at train station across the street ($5 a day)"
The not so good: don't plan on watching any TV. There are limited channels and even those cut in and out every few seconds. There is no cell phone service in the studio and the WiFi wasn't working for half my stay (though I will say Gavin was very accommodating in trying to get that up and running),the shower drainage is poor and there ends up being a pool of water by the end,there was little spots of mold on the shower curtain,no free street parking except on weekends,,
All in all,I would not stay here again. One part of the listing was inaccurate and I thought I would have a parking pass and didn't. The first day I got there I spent a half hour in rush hour traffic trying to find a spot,"but it was all resident parking or for limited time. The host was attentive but there were too many things that need to be improved. \"",,,

While nothing happened, the apartment doesn't feel like the safest that we could have rented in that area. I was thankful to have the hubby there with me, otherwise I would have reconsidered."

We came on a college visit trip and found this apartment to be a perfect home base for the Boston schools we visited. We walked to the New England Aquarium, nice italian restaurants in the North End, and close by subway access allowed us to get to the Museum of Fine Arts easily. The apartment itself was spotlessly clean and well stocked with high quality pots and pans, good kitchen knives, flatware, linens, comfy beds (one a fold out couch that worked fine for our two high schoolers); there were even a couple of bottles of wine waiting for us when we arrived! The WiFi, cable TV, workout gym, and on site parking only added to the experience. Even the shower was great - strong and hot! All communications with Richard were smooth and prompt, and we have no complaints. We would love to stay again if we're in the Boston area."

The location was perfect and just a five minute walk to Fanuiel Hall. Richard was very easy to get a hold of and the directions were very easy to follow. If I go back to Boston, which I will, because the city has so much to offer, I will be back at one of Richard's places!"

Jason is a warm and fun person to hang out with and he is also a cleanliness freak :) The room and bed were comfortable and it's a nice ,quiet and a very safe  neighborhood."
"Jason went out of the way to make sure I was comfortable. I will definitely stay here the next time I visit Boston. \"",,,,,
3945704,20377871,2014-09-28,21378488,Brittany,"Jason was very welcome, kind, and accommodating.  The room was actually larger than the pictures make it look and it was in a great location as well. I would recommend staying with Jason."
3945704,20621127,2014-10-02,14227707,Andrés,"stay in Jason´s house was excelent. house was clean, comfortble and near to Boston Downtown. Jason is a good person and great host. I enjoyed my stay in his house."
3945704,20858056,2014-10-06,8901855,Anthony,"I've had some great hosts on Airbnb, but Jason was one of the best! He made sure to be home when I arrived and showed me around the apartment. Jason is great and it was fun to have some conversation with him. He was also very accessible via text all the time."
As for the apartment itself,it is extremely clean,well decorated/furnished,and very comfortable. The bedroom is actually bigger than it looks in the pictures and I had plenty of space. I didn't have much time to use the kitchen,but it was nice and available if I had wanted to.,
Jason lives in a great area that was super convenient to get to anywhere in Boston using public transit. I did bring a car and parking got a little tricky,but only because there was some repaving happening on the road the day I was there.,,,,
HIGHLY recommend staying with Jason when you are in Boston,"I know I'll be back next time I am in town!\"",,,,
3945704,21431973,2014-10-17,2857583,Veikko,"Jason had made good preparations and gave us before arrival detailet information how to reach his place. He was able to answer all our questions and he was relly helpful. Though we were only two day it was better for us to take a seven day pass for local transportation. Everything was, what you expect and hope to have. Surrounding safe. Local transport near. Informationmaterial availabe. I would make another stay, if going to Boston again."
3945704,21488450,2014-10-18,17907655,Chris,Jason's room was a great place to crash. The bed was comfy and the room spacious. The apartment is close to the metro station and there are a couple of good places to eat nearby. I only met Jason briefly but he was really helpful and we had an interesting conversation. Would definitely recommend.

3945704,22701621,2014-11-12,22220001,Jason,"I had a great stay at Jason's place! The room was very clean and comfortable, and the building was quiet. It felt like home. There is a subway stop nearby (5-10 minute walk), and from there you can get to anywhere in the city. Plenty of restaurants, bars, and corner stores in the area too. Jason was friendly and an overall great host.  I highly recommend his place and I'd definitely stay there again."
3945704,22873902,2014-11-16,22130744,Brian,Great host. Exactly as described.

Upon arrival Jason offered ideas for things to see places to eat which was needed as I knew nothing of Boston.,,,,,
Pizza,'Jim B' and good conversation were great extras after a day of traveling.,,,,
Highly recommend future guests to stay there at Jason's.,,,,,
Cheers,,,,,

Great host, awesome place, and great area. Will definitely stay here again next time I come to Boston!"
3945704,27952066,2015-03-15,27207838,Maca,Jason was great with us! He told us about places we should visit and bars to have a drink. He was realy warm! We felt really comfortable in his apartment and had a great time there.

His room was exactly as described, the air mattress was fantastically comfortable. He keeps a very clean apartment, and respects the privacy of his guests. I was in town on business for 5 days and the stay made the trip very manageable. His directions to the place were spot on and he was available for any questions I had. Arriving late on the first night, he was willing to accommodate my arrival with the utmost of care and ease. Being my first experience, it was a pleasure to meet him and hear about his travels. If you are ever in Boston and his rooms are available, do yourself a favor and book with Jason, he treats AirBnB as a business with the personal touches of simply being a guest in his home. A+!"

Coffee, tea and bottled water were all supplied. The nearest tram station was a short 5 minutes walk away and only three stops from the heart of Boston."
"Everything was clean and tidy. I thought I was the only one there.\"",,,,,
3945704,32799719,2015-05-21,12841008,Stefan,"Jason was great. He helped us with maps of boston and a first orientation in the city. The room was very clean and quiet in a beautiful appartment.

3945704,33543114,2015-05-29,12705641,Tom,"Jason was a very gracious host. He was able to meet me when I arrived and even installed an air-conditioner in the room I stayed in to deal with the heat. It made the room very comfortable. Our interaction was brief as I was busy attending a conference the entire stay, but he was very kind and eager to provide any assistance needed. A+"

Every question I had was answered right away, and I felt safe in our private room."
3945704,37509131,2015-07-07,15191074,Karn,Jason was an excellent host. I booked for a sofa bed but he let me stay in another room with a real bed because it was available. I really appreciate it. The place was tidy and spacious. The location is perfect since it's very close to the train station. :)

3945704,38183583,2015-07-13,1430910,Jane And Scott,"Jason' apartment was immaculately clean and organized.  We had some misunderstanding about the nature of the rental and he really bent over backward to accommodate our needs, without having to do so.   He communicates well in advance and is ready to help in any way possible - a very nice and thoughtful person and a great host."
Easy location for T-line transportation.  Seem to be a lot of good,"well-priced Polish restaurants in his neighborhood (Try 'Polonia')\"",,,,
3945704,38568367,2015-07-16,14879421,Malcolm,"Top bloke and a great host. Looks after his place keeping it clean with some added perks like bottled water, coffee and individually folded hand towels. Room was clean and tidy with a comfy memory foam mattress and aircon. Place is a short walk to the metro which gave fast access to the city (only 2 stops to the main south station) or a few more to the park etc."
Best thing about this place though is the host,"he's an open caring guy who goes the extra mile he helped me sort my laundry out and advised about the city when needed would recommend.\"",,,,
3945704,38975863,2015-07-20,24473095,Paul,"Exactly as described. Jason was a fantastic host full of great places to eat and drink at, as well as what to go and see."

As for the space, everything was impeccably clean and nicely furnished. The bed was super comfy and he restocked towels in the bathroom every day. Wonderful host, wonderful space, 5 stars all around. Thank you, Jason!"
3945704,42806169,2015-08-15,14843448,Roberta,"Staying at Jason has been a very good experience. He's a very nice person and the apartment is pretty. Our room was big, clean and with a super comfortable bed (I loved it!). While booking I had not understood that we'd have had to share the bathroom with his roommate too but we just stayed one night and worked just fine. As we got to Boston by car the apartment was in a very good spot as it's 1 min driving from the highway! Subway instead is 10 min walking, which is good too."
3945704,43820238,2015-08-22,39689388,Martin,"Jason is a cool and relaxed guy and he has done everything to make me enjoy my stay in Boston. The room has AC, which is nice in the hot and humid Boston summer."

Si vede che e' ben curata da una persona che ci tiene a star bene ed a far star bene gli altri. a circa 100mt dalla stazione della metro. Il proprietario e' molto gentile e presente per qualsiasi informazione o suggerimento su cosa fare o vedere nella sua meravigliosa citta'. Consiglio decisamente questa stanza. Stanza privata con bagno in comune,non appartamento."
3945704,44622724,2015-08-27,42319916,Rameez,Awesome host! Makes you feel at home and helps you out with places to go around the area. Really good location too. Overall Really good Experience!

3945704,47928211,2015-09-21,3394413,Arundhati,"Jason was an amazing host. The apartment was just as described & very clean, organized. Though it is a working class neighborhood...otherwise  peaceful & very well connected by subway T line to downtown."

3945704,51938019,2015-10-25,45106717,Pat,"Jason was a great host - while we didn't cross paths, we didn't have any issues in getting into the place and he was accommodating by allowing us to leave our bags on Sunday while we went out for a final day of sightseeing. The room was clean and quite large, and the bed was comfy. He provided towels and other basic amenities, and the bathroom and other common areas were clean as well. His shower was quite nice, with a large rain shower head. The location is convenient, as it's a 5 minute walk to the T station where you can grab a train right downtown, or directly out to Cambridge/Harvard."
All in all,"a great experience. \"",,,,
3945704,52430893,2015-10-29,45643568,Martin,Nice neighbourhood. Relaxed athmosphere. Very open welcome from Jason. I felt at home.

We didn't spend a ton of time walking around his area- but he's super close to the T train. Takes just a few minutes to get anywhere."
3945704,62326206,2016-02-13,23208428,Chengqi,"Jason was such a cool host, very quickly in responding and a great communicator.

3945704,63580773,2016-02-24,5560542,Eugene,Very simple - Jason was the best host I met so far through Airbnb. I think he should get some kind of award :) expectations are exceeded. Room is clean. Location is awesome. Host is very helpful.
3945704,64136975,2016-02-29,55303476,Mark,"The room was great and the accommodations were neat, clean, and very comfortable.  Jason was the perfect host.  He respected my privacy and at the same time made me feel welcome.  I enjoyed speaking with him, and I truly feel like I made a new friend.  When do you get that feeling at a hotel?  I definitely will be staying at Jason's place again!"
3945704,64710144,2016-03-06,45386891,Yann,Jason made our weekend trip to Boston really easy ! His apartment is indeed close to the Red Line which makes going in and out of town a formality. We also received our own set of keys which gave us total flexibility.
The room was clean and quiet,and all the useful informations were displayed on a cute note. The mattress was SO COMFY,perfect to relax after walking all day.,,,
"I would come back without any hesitation if I need a place to crash in Boston. Best of luck Jay !\"",,,,,
3945704,65420644,2016-03-13,8350758,Jackson,"Jason was awesome, so was his place.  Honestly, a lot of other places that I have been to were good, but it was always the case that the photos looked better.  Jason's place was definitely better than it looks in the photos (at least for me). I felt that it was much more spacious than I had expected. The place is also really quiet at night, which I needed. It had everything I needed as well."
Jason makes you feel like you're crashing at a friend's place. Of course,"the kind and generous type of friend.  \"",,,,
3945704,66112598,2016-03-19,20631385,Drew,"Had a great stay; Jason was thoughtful, responsive, detail-oriented, unobtrusive, friendly, very helpful. I also really enjoyed the neighborhood that has a strong Polish background. Would definitely stay here again."
3945704,66240333,2016-03-20,38083372,Loryn,"Jason was awesome.  It was my first time using Airbnb, and he went the extra mile to make sure my needs were taken care of.  He even let me store my luggage in the living room while I explored the city a little more before my flight.  The bed was extremely comfortable, which contributed to the first good night's sleep for about a week (after working long hours at a conference nearby).  The apartment was very close to where I wanted to go, and I could even walk to Southie for the St. Patrick's Day parade, instead of taking an uber or lyft since the streets were blocked off."
All in all,"it felt like I was home.  I hope other airbnb hosts are as accommodating as Jason was for me.  I'll definitely be using it again.\"",,,,
3945704,69047779,2016-04-08,20870015,Mark,Jason's place is exactly like the pictures. The bed is very comfortable and the room is super quiet.

We found his place easily by using public transportation and when we arrived Jason was kind and generous, and his place is beautiful and clean. My boyfriend enjoyed playing video games, while I enjoyed eating some delicious food from a restaurant nearby. We made some great memories and wish Jason well in all his future endeavors. He is a great host."
3945704,70492993,2016-04-18,62583863,Siri,Jason is probably one of the friendliest host you'll find! He made me feel welcome from the moment I booked my stay in Boston. He was super helpful from the start! He gave me and my friend a really warm welcome when we arrived and he had a ton of small brochures of different sights in Boston and several maps which gave us an easy start to making our way around the city. He has a lot of recommendations to places to go for dinner/drinks etc.
The apartment is very clean and it makes you feel at home. We didn't get to spend too much time around the house,but when we met him there he always engaged in conversation and asked us about how our trip was going. The pictures truly show what the room looks like! And the apartment is in a cute little street and it's blissfully quiet in that area! It's really a great location and it's easy to get anywhere from the apartment.,,,,

It was really close to convention we were attending, and the area was really nice as well.

3945704,72930030,2016-05-05,14524689,Märta,"Jason was an excellent host. He was very welcoming and helpful when I arrived and during my stay by answering my questions and genuint caring and being interested in what I wanted to do.

3945704,75223471,2016-05-20,20639041,Elbert,"Stayed with Jason for a few days and couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Immaculate, comfortable, and quiet home, with an awesome host who's up for shooting the breeze or leaving you alone.  Thanks for the hospitality, Jason, see you around!"
3945704,75259022,2016-05-20,50623584,Zun,"The house is located at a very quiet street. And we found the parking space easily. The room was extremely clean and neat. Jason was very nice and friendly. He was very patient and recommended us where to go in a very short stay in Boston. I think he showed us the best of Boston so we enjoyed very much. Also we enjoyed our stay at his house since we haven't slept in such a quiet room for a long long time. Moreover, Jason texted me if there is anything that he could work on to improve the quality of stay. I was really impressed by that even though I could come up with one thing or two. I'll be at Boston with my mom in July. I hope that we could stay at Jason's house again!"
3945704,75696120,2016-05-22,47181711,Ruleo,"This is a great listing. The house is great. The room is awesome. Jason has water stocked for you in the fridge, and a really good descriptive brochure in the room that even had cups to uber and other transportation services."
3945704,76259399,2016-05-26,23714215,Jessica,"Had an absolutely fantastic stay at Jason's place. The room is exactly as pictured, very spacious and super clean - just like the rest of his apartment. He made us feel very welcome and comfortable upon arrival and couldn't do more to help - advice, maps, cool apps to use etc. The place is in a quiet residential location just over 5 minute walk to a very convenient and quick sub into town (his place is located so that all trains on that line can be taken into town/back to his place which means you never wait long for a train!). Also lots of personal touches - 'info sheet' and little necessities provided (if needed) made the stay even better. Great host, great place, would definitely stay again if returning to Boston."
3945704,77776398,2016-06-03,11196697,Kathryn,Jason was able to assist my mother in directions and other kind gestures which made her first trip to Boston more relaxing and welcoming.
3945704,77946372,2016-06-04,41811920,Yuyao,"I stayed at Jason's room for one night. He was very helpful, telling me how to order food from the nearest restaurant and how to travel to the place I wanted to go."
3945704,78320220,2016-06-06,75096132,Jena,"My husband and I stayed with Jason this weekend. It was perfect! The room was comfortable and quiet, so much so that we were able to keep the window open and fall asleep to a cool breeze and the sound of crickets (we're from New York, so this was a novelty to us). The bed was so comfy that we actually took a nap when we arrived, which we never do. There were thoughtful touches everywhere, from the well-stocked side table in the bedroom with everything from pens to maps to shower supplies, to the basket of neatly rolled washcloths in the bathroom (and nearby hamper). We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go, although I'll admit that at the end of the night we did avail ourselves of the Uber discount code Jason helpfully provided! And, not that it would have been anyone's fault if we had a hard time parking, but we were able to get a spot directly in front of the building, which was pretty sweet. Also, there's a rain showerhead in the bathroom; if that doesn't spark your interest, you are probably some kind of monster."
"Jason is a friendly and attentive host who has clearly put a lot of time and care into making his place a welcoming retreat. Definitely recommended!\"",,,,,
3945704,78748138,2016-06-08,55564877,Anthony,Jason's place was a really convenient spot to stay in order to fully enjoy Boston.
His apartment is clean with a spacious bedroom and he was even kind enough to offer us a drink from his well-stocked in-house bar the first evening we met.,,,,,
"Jason was kind enough to provide lots of recommendations with regards to the local area and made sure our stay was an enjoyable one.\"",,,,,
3945704,80072443,2016-06-16,72608023,Thunnisa,"Jason was very welcoming and helpful with suggestions for local food places and things to do! The house was clean, inviting and had a great ambiance! We would definitely stay here again!"
3945704,81361431,2016-06-22,43871757,Marcos,"Jason was a terrific host, before getting to his apt he contacted me and gave all the instructions. The location is very convenient, 5min walk from the subway and quite easy to go downtown or to the airport. The apt is exactly what you see in the pictures, clean and the room is very spacious. The coffee machine and bottled water are a plus. I was visiting Boston to attend a conference and I was very busy, I only met Jason personally once, but everyday he texted me to check if I needed something. I definitely recommend Jason as a host!"
3945704,81844891,2016-06-25,26140704,Zoey,"It was very great to stay at Jason's place, very tidy, quiet and comfortable! He's so nice!"
3945704,82247008,2016-06-27,27070347,Beth,"Thank you, Jason, for being a wonderful host! My son and I had a fabulous time, and we LOVED that rainfall shower :)"
3945704,82941845,2016-06-30,13078515,Sudhanshu,It was great staying at Jason's place. His place is only 2 stops away from downtown Boston. Takes less than 20 minutes to get downtown on the T. Jason's place was clean and comfortable. Jason is a very welcoming and accommodating host. I would highly recommend staying at his place!
3945704,83769646,2016-07-04,80696528,Soo,Jason is so kind. He replied my question  quickly.
"House is clean and cozy.\"",,,,,
3945704,84262260,2016-07-06,6629616,Valerie,Place was comfortable and as described. We loved the convenient location near the metro and Jason was very helpful and kind.
3945704,86236937,2016-07-15,7120788,Badal,"The room and the apartment as a whole were neat and clean. Jason is very welcoming! I had a very late flight when checking in, and Jason made arrangements for me to check in at a very late hour. The room AC unit makes it easy to sleep in hot July. The apartment is very quiet, as promised. Bottled water in the fridge was a nice touch!"
Jason even upgraded me to a slightly larger room at no cost to me since the bigger room was available.,,,,,
The neighborhood itself is not too exciting,"but it's a 5 min walk to Andrew train station which will get you downtown in 2/3 quick stops. Harborwalk is about a mile away if you want to go for a jog/walk. There are some large stores nearby but I never visited any of those. \"",,,,
3945704,86716407,2016-07-17,53086382,Genevieve,"Jason was very friendly and very easy to get in touch with. The room was very spacious and the apartment was very clean. It was an easy ~5 minute walk to the Andrew T stop, and a 20 minute ride into Boston."
3945704,88136708,2016-07-23,59343286,Yousef,"This place was really great and it was clean. I was in town for a conference and I need a room to stay. In any case, I really enjoyed my stay and the host Jason was really nice. If I had a questions, he would always message me back in a timely manner. He even left some essentials and snacks, which was very nice. Regarding the neighborhood, it seemed nice and everyone I interacted with was friendly. While there I used the subway frequently, which was took about five minutes’ walk. Otherwise, you can always use ride-share apps as well to get where you are going. In brief, I was highly satisfied with my stay."
3945704,89623541,2016-07-29,50769495,Thomas,Just as listed.
3945704,90842649,2016-08-02,4019203,Christian,My wife and I had a great stay in Boston. Our first experience. Jason's apartment helped with this as it was just perfect. Very clean and well located. We had a chance to chat with Jason and he oriented our second day visit. Thanks again.
3945704,92590341,2016-08-09,71289218,Varatit,"Nice, cozy, convenient location, and most important : great host. Constantly getting in touch to make sure that the guest is ok."
This trip,my luggage was delayed for a few days. Later,"the airline said they would called before the delivery between 1-4 am. I didn't receive the call that night but found my luggage in front of my bedroom in the morning. I couldn't thank him enough for bringing my large bag up 3 floors.\"",,,
3945704,93473408,2016-08-13,80384670,Fran,Jason greeted us as we came in and made us feel right at home.
3945704,94477998,2016-08-15,84635362,纳凯,"Jason is really a good host, recommending some good places in Boston for me to visit and have dinner. The room is clean and location is great! I'll choose to stay here when I come to Boston again."
3945704,97759143,2016-08-28,87426905,Bryce,The place was very clean and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioner in the room worked great! It was in a great location for the business I was doing and overall I had a very pleasant stay! I would recommend!
3945704,98990709,2016-09-03,18656288,Rebecca,What a fantastic air bnb!
I stayed with my boyfriend for 5 days and loved every minute of it.,,,,,
The apartment itself is super clean and very chic. The room feels,,,,,
Boutiquey and very spacious and the aircon was a blessing in the hot Boston summer.,,,,,
Location wise the T (train) is 5 minutes walk away and Jason's amazing stash of offer codes had us taking free uber/lyft taxis for most of our trip - amazing!,,,,,
As for Jason himself he really deserves his rep as a super host. He's incredibly friendly and professional and really went out of his way to accommodate us (with our funny arrival/departure times) and make us feel welcome. He gave us some great recommendations for places to eat/drink/visit and even provides a guide book to use during your stay. He was so easy to communicate with and we left feeling more like friends than just his guests.,,,,,
"Thanks for an awesome stay Jason - we'll be back! \"",,,,,
3945704,99631360,2016-09-05,34393569,Jessica,"Jason was great! I had an early train in and he arranged with me how to drop off my bag since he had guests the night before. I was pleasantly surprised that he was actually there and greeted me when I came in. He did everything to try and ensure I could check in a bit early, which was much appreciated after an overnight train ride. The room and apartment was super clean, and he even had items like granola bars, water and things to freshen up with in the room. He was very helpful and friendly. The neighborhood is conveniently located by the Red Line, which will easily get you into downtown Boston in a few stops."
4526384,29872038,2015-04-13,30289284,Dori,"Lovely and beautiful home in a friendly, quiet neighborhood! We stayed in Unit 2, which was very spacious and charming. There actually was only one room (not two, as listed in the description) on the 3rd floor with 2 full size beds; the other two rooms had queen size beds. The master bathroom on the second floor was amazing! Everyone took turns either soaking in the jacuzzi tub or enjoying the jetted shower. There is plenty of space in the living room/kitchen area for a large group to dine together, play games, or watch a movie."
The walls are very thin in this home,and noise travels very easily. You can hear normal-level conversations with the door closed from the room next door,"or even the floor above or below you. \"",,,
4526384,35721446,2015-06-21,29880580,Timothy,Our stay was wonderful.  Great host. Great House. Great area.  What else could you ask for?
4526384,44106549,2015-08-24,23121553,Amer,Aihua was a great host! The house and location couldn't have been more perfect for me and my family. If ever in the area I will defiantly book with Aihua again.
4526384,50295923,2015-10-11,41832802,Kris,Our house near Harvard was spacious and clean and we had everything we needed. It was a great location and we were able to get around easily and truly enjoyed our first visit to Boston.
Our host,"let us check in early which was very helpful.  Even though there is only parking on one side of the street we didn't have a problem. \"",,,,
4526384,50798567,2015-10-14,15689995,Jeanne,"We really liked the electronic lock that allowed us to be able to get into the house without keys.  The house was not as nice as we had expected at the rate charged.  The basement bedroom was the only one with a bath with some privacy, but the low ceilings, steep stairs and uneven flooring made it feel like it was a frat house, and the two double beds in that room made it less than ideal for a married couple (parents) to stay in with a family."
4526384,70713038,2016-04-20,18095535,Nick,Aihua's listing was cozy and welcoming - plenty of towels and bathroom supplies. The keyless entry made it very convenient and safe. The listing was very accurate and I would certainly recommend this listing as a viable option for a family up to 10 guests (5 couples / beds) in town for the Boston Marathon or other. The listing is close enough to public transit to access all parts of the city as well.
4526384,76638948,2016-05-28,42213762,Giora,"\"We spend 4 nights at the house and the bottom line is that we had a good experience. We were 6 adults one baby and one small child.  The house  was well  equipped (Towels, sheets). We had good communication with the host and she agreed to check us in before the \"\"Official time\"\". Overall it was good experience."
"Parking arrangements were  problematic since there were two parking slots for us and the neighbor  apartment that block each other and in the morning when we want to go out we found ourselves blocked. \"",,,,,
7881551,45914190,2015-09-06,43304971,Norah,"The apartment was lovely and exactly as described. Clean, well maintained. Perfect location with easy access to the metro, shopping, great restaurants. Would absolutely stay again."
Jason answered all questions we had before our trip,"and got back to me promptly. Very friendly and helpful. \"",,,,
7881551,46312819,2015-09-09,41499083,Gayle,"This was my first experience and it will forever change how I travel from now on! I loved the location and have realized you get so much more from being immersed in the local culture as opposed to being insulted within the confines of a hotel. The location of this brownstone apartment could not have been better for feeling like a Bostonian. Although it was an older building, the proximity to Newbury Street, (the equivalent of Rodeo Drive in Boston) the Boston Library, and Boston Commons park was fantastic! The room was comfortable and the kitchen well stocked with equipment. What impressed me the most, however, was Jason's concern for my comfort. He let me know before I arrived that the air conditioner had broken–and, with a freakish heat wave hitting Boston that week, he had to order the replacement online. A member of Jason's team was waiting for me (and the air conditioner) when I checked in and had it set up shortly thereafter. Jason followed up more than once to make certain I was cool and comfortable. The point I'd like to make is that a good experience doesn't mean that everything went perfectly. A good experience is when a potential problem is handled in an effective and timely manner, as was the case here. I would definitely stay at this location again! Thanks Jason!"
7881551,47129734,2015-09-15,31619146,Katherine,"\"I love that studio so much. This is my first experience to book a room at Airbnb. It's wonderful and amazing. I never thought there's a way I can travel like this. Jason is a awesome host. I forgot to call him, and he call me first. That was so thoughtful. His studio is clean and cozy. I share the pictures to my friends. They just don't believe I can find such a \"\"hotel\"\" in Boston! I had a good time in Boston"
7881551,47845964,2015-09-21,8113864,Simon,Ideally located to visit Boston. Everything you want to see is walking distance from this cozy studio (good for a couple). Pictures are accurate. Jason and his friend Ryan are very helpful and flexible ! I appreciate my stay !
7881551,48121731,2015-09-23,2353933,Jeff,"The apartment and the neighborhood were as advertised - both were great. There are many excellent sights, bars, and restaurants within easy walking distance. The apartment itself is small but very nicely furnished and very clean. I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area."
7881551,48236047,2015-09-24,30511957,Matthew,"Our experience at Jason's place was fantastic. He was very responsive and gaining access was a breeze. The studio was clean and Jason provided everything we needed. Additionally, the location was incredible......close to amazing restaurants, shopping an d nightlife. I'm not sure you'll find a better price and location in Boston!"
7881551,48740350,2015-09-28,25708371,David,"Jason's garden-level studio is in an ideal location, in the heart of Back Bay and close to several subway and bus lines. The studio itself is really comfortable and well-appointed; it was impeccably clean and the Internet connection was fast. The bathroom is modern. Jason was extremely responsive to our questions and was a terrific host who seemed genuinely concerned that everything was perfect for our stay."
7881551,48935040,2015-09-29,44041046,Amber,"Jason was very responsive to all the questions we had, the studio is clean and the neighborhood is very charming, I would highly recommend to book with Jason."
7881551,49640152,2015-10-05,42897079,Pam,Great location in Back Bay.  Bit tricky to get the key lock open as we arrived in the night and it is difficult to see the numbers.  Make sure you have a light of some sort to help you.  Very close to main shopping areas and bars/restaurants.
Appt itself is well equipped.  There are a few things that are annoying about the place but Jason responded to our issues very quickly  and has promised to look into them.  The main issue is the noise from other apartments ( this appt is the basement floor with other appts above it),we think when using the shower.  This noise woke us up each day between 4 & 5 am,and we are not light sleepers at all,but this did disturb our rest.,,
Overall we had a good time,and assuming that the issues we raised are resolved,"we would return and recommend you to stay in this apartment.\"",,,
7881551,49813871,2015-10-06,28251827,Jacky,The apartment may be petite but very tastefully furnished--perfect for two people.

If you go to Boston that's the perfect spot to be,"beautiful neighborhood with a walking distance to everything. 100% recommendable \"",,,,
7881551,50786112,2015-10-14,32088555,Mark,I will start by saying I would defiitely stay here again.
I am an Airbnb vet - this is one of the most responsive hosts you will get.,,,,,
Absolutely beautiful neighboorhood. Took Uber anywhere I wanted to go for less than $12. Walked a few blocks to Copley Station for subway access across the city. Walked through Boston Commons to many great dinner spots.,,,,,
The room is small,but larger than many nearby hotel rooms that don't include a stove and fridge (this does). You will be on the first floor so with ATT you won't get a signal inside the room,but you can put your phone in the window or step outside. You get free Netflix,"but not \"\"live\"\" TV per se. That being said",are you really here to watch TV?,
Bed is comfortable. Neighboorhood is amazing (people were taking pictures). There is some noise inside the building,but it dies down early and I always bring earplugs.,,,,
"Just don't expect a lot of space and you'll be fine. Great value.\"",,,,,
7881551,51030358,2015-10-17,6379390,Marco,"Everything worked very well with Jason! House is very comfortable, location is the best in Boston, close walk to everything. I would definitely reccomend it."

7881551,51644603,2015-10-22,12988122,Pramath,Jason was very helpful. I had trouble finding the key and called him and he was able to help. Then I left my suit hanging in the place and he again contacted me and was extra helpful in getting the suit back. The apartment is very comfortable and very clean. I would highly recommend it. It is ground floor so if you have heavy luggage good place to stay. On a few steps down to enter.
7881551,51774901,2015-10-24,27691119,Ashleigh,"Jason was a very responsive and accommodating host. The apartment is on a great street in the Back Bay within walking distance of many of Boston's best sites, restaurants, and neighborhoods. The place itself is clean and well appointed.

You also have great restaurant and an huge park next to the appartement. The only negative thing we could say was about the parking. Its complicated to find one and you can only have access to it for 2 hours except if you go to newsbury street where you can find some parking for 50$ a day. We would definitely recommand this place. And jason is always available. He did answer so fast to our question we felt like home."

It's a wonderfully walkable location to anything and everything you'd want to experience in Boston.  The bed is comfy and the wifi fast.  The building is a little noisy, but we were there over a holiday weekend so I have a feeling this had something to do with it."

I'm originally from Boston and when I came across Jason's listing, I knew it was just what I was looking for.  It didn't disappoint.  The studio is so charming and private.  It had everything I needed to live comfortably for a few days (extra towels, toilet paper, hair dryer, etc) Also, the bed is Tempur-Pedic and sooooo comfy!! It was truly a home away from home.  The neighborhood is the prettiest in the city and the location is prime.  It's located just two blocks away from the city's best restaurants and shopping.  You really can't pick a better spot. Jason was super responsive and answered all of my Q's in a very timely manner.  I would def stay here again!"

I had a couple of questions for Jason the night of, he answerd my calls and texts promptly and kindly. One warning-parking in the area is mostly resident only. We lucked out with a spot but were heading for a garage."

The neighborhood made us easily fall in love with Boston.. but the parking was a bit of an issue (starting at 8am there's a 2-hour meter you have to feed. which means you have to constantly move your car until 6pm).

Jason was super quick to answer any and all my questions via email and text messages.  His apartment was beautiful, the location better than we could imagine, with a quick 5 minute walk to the metro, and to plenty of places to shop and eat. The shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure. The bedding was better than any hotels with great pillows, and fluffy duvet. Overall wonderful trip. Wed definitely go back if Jason would have us again!"

7881551,60643723,2016-01-25,5055782,Christine,"This place is a gem in the middle of Boston! The location cannot be beat, and the apartment is a perfect, quiet, comfortable get-away. The bed is comfortable and the Roku set-up fully supported some Netflix binge watching on a snowy weekend. Jason is a great host! We hope to come back again soon."
7881551,61073697,2016-01-31,6077895,Justine,Jason's place was exactly as advertised. The room is wonderfully cozy. I personally loved how close it was to Boston Commons. Subway and other public transportation is all an easy walking distance. Jason responds quickly and was helpful with any and all questions.

He responded super fast with whatever concerns we had(we blew a fuse during our stay and he helped to to fix it) The apartments is very close to downtown Boston which is great.

7881551,63730197,2016-02-26,4867485,Kathryn,I had a great stay at Jason's flat. All was as expected and the process of getting in and leaving was smooth and simple. The location is perfect.
7881551,64130360,2016-02-29,58761590,Michael,"Staying at Jason's place was a great choice for a person using Airbnb for the first time (me).  The place was the perfect size, and being in Back Bay, it was right in the middle of everything.  Close to Boston University, close to downtown and really close to Newbury St.  Jason's place was pretty well kept, and he was accommodating on letting us drop off our bags early and even gave us a great recommendation for a place to grab a Boston seafood dinner.  Wouldn't have stayed in Boston any other way."
7881551,65614368,2016-03-15,37628850,Alexander,Excellent!
7881551,65917865,2016-03-18,14947721,Sylvie,"Jason' s place is in the great Backbay neighborough in a walking distance of T and shops. Nice little parlor level studio very clean and a great tempur bed. Jason was very responsive to all my inquiries over the phone. The one little drawback for me was not to be able to open the patio door nor the windows to get fresh air in the room. But, Jason said this  was going to be fixed."
7881551,66246696,2016-03-20,41575526,Kevin,"Jason was respondent and helpful to any questions I had during the weekend. The space itself is cozy and comfortable and is in an excellent location- cannot stress that enough.  During colder weather the windows are old and create a huge draft. On the flip side, the windows are only one side of the studio, so natural sunlight is limited."
7881551,66743265,2016-03-24,41181738,재윤,"He's right. Incredible location. it's near by Newbury st, so you can shopping all day. (bunch of restaurant too)and quiet place also. it is same as picture and cozy. but one thing, in my case i was not comfortable with bed. maybe it's too soft to me..except that, I have a good memory of Jason's house. Nice. you should go."

He was very accommodating with our check-out time which helped us maximize our time in the city! The place was very clean and the bed was super comfy which was exactly what we needed after a long day of walking around. If we're ever back in Boston or know someone that's visiting, we'll definitely recommend Jason's place."
7881551,72688995,2016-05-04,26499303,Kimberley,Nice clean apartment with an extremely comfy bed and great wifi service. The host was very responsive to any questions we had before and during our stay. The only item missing in the apartment is a table to eat. The accent table provided is simply to small to eat on.
7881551,73061091,2016-05-06,44888112,Winnie,"really homie place,  I stayed for 5 nights and it was extremely comforting.

7881551,73719276,2016-05-09,50095562,Katie,"Jason was very responsive to texts and questions. The apartment was easy to locate and very accessible, in a beautiful part of Boston. It was exactly as pictured and extremely clean and functional. High quality furnishings and amenities were provided. The location was central to many popular sites and close to public transport. Heating worked well. The only qualm was the bed - my boyfriend and I both kept rolling into the middle, which was a little disruptive on our first night but we slept well the rest of our time there. Overall we were very pleased with our experience at Jason's apartment."

The Good:,,,,,
-Location! Tons of restaurants and shopping nearby. The Copley station is about a 5 min walk.,,,,,
- The place was clean and had all of the necessary amenities.,,,,,
- The bed was great.,,,,,
- The water pressure in the shower is amazing.,,,,,
- The portable AC unit kept us comfortable at night. It was hot when we visited!,,,,,
The not so good:,,,,,
- The place is pretty small,but was fine for the two of us.,,,,
- The apartment seems to mostly be wired to one circuit breaker which can be overloaded fairly easily. We had to make sure the portable AC unit was turned off before we used the hair dryer or iron,or else the breaker would trip.,,,,
- A little noisy. Street noise was audible,"but this did not affect us from sleeping soundly. \"",,,,
7881551,77662680,2016-06-02,18024349,Kinga,"My boyfriend and I loved the apartment in Back Bay.  It was only a few blocks from newbury street, Copley plaza, and just about everything.  The apartment itself was cozy and had a lot of light for a garden unit."
The bed was comfy but seemed to be falling apart.  Another issue we had was that a fuse blew,causing all the lights to go out,and when I contacted the host,he didn't know where the box was to reset it and took over an hour to get back to us.,,
Overall,for the price,"the unit was great.  We loved the location and the roku!\"",,,
7881551,78111364,2016-06-05,70728695,Greg,Host was very responsive to questions.  Really amazing location.  Definitely enjoyed my stay.
7881551,79222108,2016-06-12,74838591,Orlando,"Jason foi atencioso e muito rápido para resolver alguns problemas com o apartamento (problemas que não foram sua culpa). A localização é fantástica, em um dos quarteirões mais bonitos de Boston, a menos de 5 minutos do metrô. O apartamento tem um ótimo quarto/sala; o banheiro e a pequena cozinha funcionam bem. Senti falta apenas de uma mesa para fazer uma refeição e para trabalhar."
7881551,79783141,2016-06-14,62249889,Cindy,"This is the place to stay! Very comfortable bed, great shower and nice kitchen - the star market is within walking distance.

One thing that guests should know that this particular listing is more or less like a Hotel-- nobody actually lives here,and it is rented out 24/7,"and it certainly has more of a hotel feel then your stereotypical Airbnb.  Also be prepared to supply your own soap and shampoo as none is provided.  \"",,,
7881551,82046256,2016-06-26,63491829,Jenn,"Great location, easy to check in/out and Jason was really great about responding quickly. I highly recommend this place if you want to stay in Back Bay."

7881551,90647913,2016-08-01,41773520,Linda,"Great location, clean and pleasant, with enough in the kitchen and bathrooms to make it very usable.  The private entrance makes it even easier.  Jason was very responsive to any questions or communication.  The air conditioner kept a hot day under control, the downside is that it is loud (though a constant sound) for anyone not used to this kind of white noise.  If you are light sensitive, bring eyeshades -- summer light comes early, even though there are shades on the windows.  Over all, a very good experience."
7881551,91241649,2016-08-04,34588206,Nancy,"Jason's apartment was absolutely perfect for our overnight stay in Boston!  It truly could not have been more ideal.

We'd love to stay again!"

Had maps and other amenities prepared for us, which was extremely convenient. I really enjoyed the private deck out back, which I don't believe was pictured in the listing.

The house is well-located, less than 10 mins from the T station in a very calm neighborhood. Everything was clean and I had well enough space for my things. The shared bathrooms were also clean I and I didn't have any problem with them. Kartik offered me space in the fridge, and was very caring during my stay, asking to see if everything was ok.

Kartik also provided free coffee [help yourself to make one] and left a particular space in the refrigerator for his guests,which was helpful for guests who would like to make breakfast themselves.,,,,
To Kartik: just one personal suggestion -- if you could add a small trash can covered by a plastic bag in the cozy room,"it would make the room more perfect :)\"",,,,
6765855,44508545,2015-08-26,24521622,Evan,Kartik was a great host...perfect place for zipping into the city for the evening.
6765855,44824893,2015-08-29,12321471,Gordon,"The host made us feel very welcome and was very helpful with questions that we had while we were there. It was only a private room in an apartment, but we had the use of bathrooms, kitchen, and laundry as well. It was comfortable and close enough to the subway for convenient travel connections in and out of Boston proper. It was worth the price, which was still below most hotels in the area.... a big plus for us since when we travel, we don't ever have time to use and pay for the amenities that so many hotels have like gyms, pools, restaurants, etc. It was a basic place to stay that gave us everything that we needed."
6765855,45327087,2015-09-01,31800846,James,"I booked Kartik's room for a colleague of mine who was in Boston on business. She said it was a clean, comfortable room in a good location. Kartik was very communicative and made the process super easy."
6765855,45692533,2015-09-05,11864857,Rhianna,"The room was fine, clean, comfy bed and a working fan. Location wasn't great, 10/15 min walk to the subway and then another 20 mins to town, no cafes or bars close by - if you're looking for that sort of air Bnb experience. The boat dos leave a few maps and directions though which were helpful. Typical noises you would expect from an apartment share as well as the room is directly next to the kitchen. A fine room."
6765855,46247669,2015-09-08,29067112,Molly,"I haven't stayed in too many airbnbs but this one was the best I've experienced so far. The room was clean and very private. We felt welcomed but the hosts left us to our own devices. In fact, we didn't see them once we arrived. We had access to a basically private bathroom that was very clean. The bed was very comfortable and the little amenities they left for us were great! Thank you!"
6765855,47407999,2015-09-18,43046065,Meimei,"Everything is good,the owner is so nice and the location is near the subway."
6765855,47599111,2015-09-20,43280153,Erik,Quick response. Beautiful flat. Nice roommates. Clean room AND two bathrooms.
Everything worked out pretty well.,,,,,
"Thank you!\"",,,,,
14760739,99342354,2016-09-04,31876784,Clytze,This place is great!
Great great location -- I stayed for 3 nights and every meal I could walk to chinatown and satisfy my cravings for legit Chinese food! Also it's only 1min's walk to Boston Common and AMC Loews,which is just great.,,,,
Yes,sometimes it's pretty loud out there,which is described pretty clear in listing description. If you are a light sleeper you might need to think twice. But as I am not a light sleeper and I was just so tired these days,I found that I slept just like a baby.,,
Wentao is a great host! He's very considerate,helpful,attentive,"making sure everything went smoothly. It was such a pleasure to meet him! \"",,
8624898,50125801,2015-10-09,24730709,Oscar,"Jordan was a great host. He let us check in early, and was easily reachable throughout our stay. He was very kind and even let us pick the tomatoes in the backyard. The apartment was very clean. The location was great as well, very close to Airport station on the blue line. We would definitely book with Jordan again."
8624898,50544280,2015-10-12,4274233,Kate,"Me and three friends stayed at Jordan's home in East Boston while in town for a wedding. It's a very minimalist space with big, comfy air mattresses for a good night sleep. There are a few good coffee spots and restaurants just down the way. Also, you cannot beat the access to the T and airport transportation. Jordan was very accommodating and quick to respond to all my questions and concerns."
8624898,50819821,2015-10-14,29928328,Randy,Great and friendly host
8624898,51350959,2015-10-19,45439030,Mimi,The listing was as described: simple and clean with necessary amenities. It was our first airbnb experience and it was wonderful! The place was very conveniently located and my toddler also loved it since we used the small third room as his very own playroom! The air mattresses were comfortable and there was plenty of space to prep meals. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone else who is looking for a comfortable place to stay. Jordan was also very quick to respond to questions and sent thorough instructions.
8624898,51563018,2015-10-21,45042948,Sarunthorn,Good
8624898,52622338,2015-10-31,42903844,Manfred,"We stayed at Jordan´s place for 2 nights. He was very friendly in letting us drop off our luggage early and check out late on the last day, since we had a late flight."
We arrived just after the former guests have left. Since we would be gone for the day,we figured,he would clean the place during the day. But when we came back late at night,the bathroom especially was still very dirty. After we called him the next day,he cleaned it.,
The whole place is as minimalistic as it gets. There is one AIR mattress (not very comfortable) and a cupboard in each bedroom,a table and chairs in the living room (no couch),one empty spare room,the small bathroom and then the kitchen,which is not very clean,either. We did not use it.
The place could use some renovating and is not homey at all. If you are only looking for a place to crash,this may be fine. Boston is expensive and maybe this is what you get for $177/night.,,,,
We would definitely not book it again,although Jordan was really friendly and helpful with tips for the area.,,,,
And yes,"it is very close to the Airport MTB Station. You can walk there in a few minutes.  \"",,,,
8624898,52886119,2015-11-02,37097137,Maha,"Jordan was a great host. We never actually got to meet him given our tight schedule but the home serves the purpose of a rest stop not really a place to spend all of your time despite how welcoming the kitchen is. I cannot stress how ideal the location is..LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! My friend and I only came in to sleep because we wanted to spend most of our time exploring so the air mattresses were sufficient. Before we arrived, Jordan gave us directions from the airport along with a list of places to check out and they were a great help."
8624898,55977602,2015-12-07,19828178,Florian,"Logement cosy dans un quartier très proche du centre, très accessible, et pourtant peu chère. Petit problème de chauffage pendant la nuit et propreté qui laisse à désirer (ne pas soulever la lunette des toilettes par exemple). A noter également que le parking gratuit ne l'est que le week-end. Mais très belle vue sur la skyline de Boston à 5 min en voiture. Bon rapport qualité/prix dans l'ensemble pour un premier week-end à Boston."
8624898,69710782,2016-04-12,4509319,Priscilla,This apartment is a great value.  The apartment was clean and welcoming.  The kitchen was great for cooking.  I got a great night's sleep.
Jordan was extremely attentive.  He provides clear instructions and gave me great food recommendations.,,,,,
Being able to walk straight to the airport makes this place a smart choice.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
8624898,70049018,2016-04-15,56983852,Linda,Listing description not accurate and we cannot comment on our host as we never saw him. Central location was excellent but the apartment left much to be desired - very poor state of maintenance.
8624898,70660594,2016-04-19,57557026,Emily,The host was eager to make us comfortable. Easy to work with.

8624898,71824497,2016-04-29,64464742,Badr,"It was a great experience, also, great host as well."
It has a very good location near from the metro station.,,,,,
The host almost was clean the main bedroom the bed was dusty a little bit.,,,,,
Also,there wasn't a private parking for the car just park anywhere in the street,that one of the main things that let you rethink if you have a car. If you don't so skip this point,,,
Everything else was great.,,,,,
"Thank you\"",,,,,
8624898,72755463,2016-05-04,41924301,Kayley,Jordan was a wonderful host. He was very kind and unbelievably accommodating when our flights landed early and left late! The space was adorable and clean and fit our needs perfectly! The apartment is extremely close to the T stop which made it convenient for getting around the city. We could not have picked a better spot to spend our time in Boston. Thank you SO much for sharing your city with us Jordan!!
8624898,73150257,2016-05-07,62441434,Erbito,"Very nice location and convenient to go to the city using T.Great neighborhood ,convenient stores and places to eat nearby.Jordan is very helpful.Only thing bathroom supplies needed the following day.Overall great stay.Thanks Jordan."
8624898,73297958,2016-05-08,61321529,Cami,Listing description is accurate and the neighborhood is fine. We even did some food shopping at a small local market at 10pm. Good places to eat nearby as well.
8624898,73982593,2016-05-12,37264867,Shu,"It was really nice for us staying there. Just about 5 min walk to the subway (they call T in Boston), it's so easy to get around. And a quiet neighborhood."
8624898,74125891,2016-05-13,28978873,Zhan,This place is very convenient and has 2 big bedrooms and 1 small one. The rooms are very clean and the place is very close to the airport. We stayed for just one day and did not have much communication with Jordan. It is convenient to enter the apartment with the passcode provided by Jordan. The only problem we had was the road noise at night for the rooms on the road side. You might need extra earplugs to be able to sleep.
8624898,75025927,2016-05-18,19298852,Scott,Great
8624898,75570392,2016-05-22,6314664,Vicki,"Jordan's place was great! The location was fantastic, walking distance to the airport and to the T. The flat was spacious, comfortable and quiet. It's the perfect flat for a group of traveling friends as it has 2 queens and a single."
8624898,77168295,2016-05-30,22262054,Danush,"Jordan's place was perfect for our group of five. Located just two stops from downtown Boston on public transit and a five minute shuttle bus ride/drive to the airport. Each room had its own air mattress (very comfortable!) - though only the main bedroom had an air conditioner, something to consider for those visiting in the summer."
"Though we didn't get to meet Jordan he made himself totally available for any questions. He even gave us some neighborhood recommendations. Definitely recommend. \"",,,,,
8624898,77967292,2016-06-04,61869873,Aruna,Jordan was an amazing host and was very responsive to any questions and concerns we had. He sent us very detailed instructions on how to get in to the place and I found his method to be very organized and easy to figure out. His place is beautiful and kept in the best condition and it looked just like the pictures in the listing. The neighborhood was very safe and overall had a nice feel to it.
8624898,78390546,2016-06-06,8066397,Saraya,The stay was great! The place was exactly how the pictures depicted. The place was conveniently located close to the airport making it easy to catch my flight.

8624898,79363372,2016-06-12,28298921,Jeremy,Jordan was accessible for questions and his place was as described. We had an overall good stay and would recommend to groups of 4 or less looking to stay in Boston on a low budget.
8624898,80542364,2016-06-18,61592683,Amanda,"Our host was really good, got back to us at a timely manner when we had questions. The place was nice and comfortable for five people. We had an issue which wasn't the hosts fault but it worked out in the end. But the place was great for being so close to the airport and the commuter rail. We would stay there again :)"
8624898,81562316,2016-06-23,12684415,Audra,"The suggestions for restaurants were fantastic.  There is plenty of places close by for groceries, food and laundry.  We found the apartment easily.  Jordan was a great communicator.  The T was only a 5 minute walk with great accessibility to downtown.  It was a great location.  Thank you for a good stay."

His apartment was easy to find and what is more important, it was as it was described. Jordan's suggestions about nearby restaurants were priceless, especially for someone who was after 8 hours of journey. If I ever happen to be in Boston again I would definitely like to stay at Jordan's.Thanks!"
8624898,82296745,2016-06-27,49215864,Stephen,"The location of this apartment is fantastic. Really easy walking distance to the T station at the airport, which leads to the center of Boston in minutes. There's a vibrant city park one block away, and multiple food options are within walking distance."
We had a short stay,but got exactly what we needed: an easy-to-access place with good,local food nearby.,,,

8624898,82931500,2016-06-30,57259540,Richard,"Very disappointed doesn't begin to explain how we felt about this trip. Booked for 3 nights and left after 1 (wouldn't have stayed one night if we had somewhere else to go). Dirty grubby apartment with single AC in one bedroom so rest of apartment was boiling, broken TV Screen, kitchen smelt of Gas, broken closet door, cracked tiles in bathroom that smelt damp, filthy stairs carpet, and dirty paint work."
Manged to get part of our money back (less than 50%)for canceled nights but only after several phone calls. Host was more interested in Airbnb cancelling booking so he could re let it rather than resolving our issues.,,,,,
I have the pictures and would of posted them on my review but cant upload them despite the AirBnB review pages saying you can upload them. Not impressed,,,,,

8624898,84519246,2016-07-07,63047527,Andrew,"Good description provided to locate and access apartment. Was indeed close to airport as advertised, this was important to us. Besides that we were disappointed. Found it difficult to find a car park close to apartment. One air conditioner in main bedroom meant rest of apartment was quite hot. Floors were not level which was a bit disconcerting as was the weak gas smell in the kitchen. TV had a big crack through the screen. Thought about moving out after first night as it was not satisfactory for my family with three young children."

Jordan gave great instructions and his nearby restaurant recommendations were excellent. I stayed here with my two kids and the proximity to transit and nearby playground with water feature were wonderful. Place was as described, nothing fancy but was just what we needed. We did find out that parking IS definitely enforced which was a surprise, but the ticket was still cheaper than parking in the city for our guests. Would stay here again for sure."
8624898,89034887,2016-07-26,1609105,Jim,You can't beat the location if you are traveling through Logan airport. Jordan was great and excellent instructions for check in and out including local recommendations.
8624898,89716828,2016-07-29,23813215,Andreas,Die Lage der Unterkunft mit direkter Anbindung zum Flughafen ist Top!! Für amerikanische Verhältnisse angemessen sauber und ausgestattet. Im großen und ganzen nichts groß auszusetzen.
Jordan war immer sehr schnell über den Airbnb App Chat zu erreichen und hat wertvolle Tipps gegeben.,,,,,
Anbindung an die Straßenbahn perfekt,ca. 3 min zu Fuß und 15 bis ins Zentrum von Boston.,,,,

8624898,91366090,2016-08-05,15236292,Yibo,"Jordan's place is quite nice. The location is the best: 3-minute-walk to the T and cannot be more convenient if you are coming from or going to the airport with the airport shuttles. Parking is okay. However, there will most certainly be parking enforcement patrolling the area and issuing tickets in the early morning."
8624898,91800907,2016-08-06,71024822,Zafar,"Our stay was for one night, but we found it very comfortable and fictional for our needs. Location was good (particularly for those using Logan Airport)."

8624898,96367650,2016-08-22,16234841,Mark W,Jordan provided us with all the info we required for a smooth arrival and check-in. The home is perfectly located near the Airport stop on the blue line. We parked across the street and used public transport throughout out visit.  The apartment is well equipped and very clean. I can highly recommend this place for visitors to Boston.

8624898,97231810,2016-08-26,90963410,Shannon,"Description was accurate. The playground/park nearby was great for our kids. It was great to have food recommendations that were close by. Parking was a little tricky, but doable. Only suggestions: hand towels and Kleenex for the bathroom would be great. We were a little concerned about the slight smell of gas from the stove."
8624898,97520429,2016-08-27,6220384,Josie,"Jordan's place is really handy for getting to and from the airport and was  fine for our one night stop over in Boston.  Jordan was good at communicating and let us stay on an hour over check out.  The house was spacious and like the pictures, however not overly toddler friendly as the floors are slightly sloping."
8624898,97891759,2016-08-28,12384624,Grant,Nice apartment near the airport.  Accomodate 5 of us easily.

The apartment was immaculate...  fresh linens, towels, soaps, shampoos, conditioners... even had some delicious local artisan chocolates as welcoming gift.  The feel of the apartment had a great feel..... well decorated/furnished and has high ceilings and big window.  The location is very central with lots of local attractions near by.  Jeff was super helpful.  Met me right on time at the building to let me in and give me keys and give me some local recommendations.  A++ experience!"

Host: Jeff was very helpful in person and by email (as was his business partner Dave). Arrival and departure arrangements worked really well. Very kindly allowed us to store luggage in apartment until the afternoon as we had late flights from Boston.,,,,,
Location: great location,just minutes walk from theatre district,Boston common,shopping,"riverside restaurants and metro stations. Only downside is that Washington street becomes a bit noisy from early morning. Felt very secure. \"",

There is a supermarket nearby.Communication with Jeff and getting access to it was very easy. I wish we had known there is no living room though, because it was not clear from the pictures. We were 4 people + a baby, so having some common space would have eased our stay in it. There is also no space for 4 people to dine / have breakfast"

I totally recommend you to stay there if you want to spend a few days in Boston. Jeff also gave us all types of recommendations about parking,  restaurants,  places to visit etc. I'll come back if I have the chance to :)"
6134867,33011591,2015-05-24,29451798,David,"It should be more clear from the posting that this is actually a one bedroom and not a two bedroom since the second 'bedroom' is actually a living room with a little bed instead of a couch. If the owner prefers to call it a two bedroom, then they should note that there is no living room or dining room or other space. Also, it should be clear there is absolutely no access by car since the road in front is pedestrian-only. If you arrive by taxi, plan on walking and, if by car, plan on paying to park in a public lot. Finally, the owner might want to mention that there is a massive construction project going on directly in front of the apartment so you should be prepared to listen to construction noise during your stay. Other than those items, it was indeed very tidy as the other feedback mentions."
6134867,33324799,2015-05-26,20414556,Felicia,"We were a group of 4 and stayed for 3 days. APARTMENT was clean and the location is fantastic, conveniently located within walking distance to the downtown crossing (train station), great restaurants and the start of the Freedom Trail."
JEFF is very responsive to all our questions and requests. The information packet that had been left for us had a summary of all the attraction and dining options in the area,as well as how to get around using the public transport. It also had clear contact information if we had encountered any problems.,,,,
SOME THINGS TO NOTE. While generally quiet,there were a few instances where we could hear people shouting from the streets at night so this might be a problem for some. Also,there is ongoing building construction across the street - workers would be able to see into one of the bedrooms. This wasn't a problem for us since we stayed over a weekend. Parking might also be a problem but Jeff would be able to point you to a few options in the neighborhood.,,,
OVERALL,"we had a great experience in Boston and would definitely recommend staying here =)\"",,,,
6134867,33592991,2015-05-30,31901712,Lakshmi,The host was the best part of the experience. Jeff was extremely responsive and most helpful. The apartment is very well located and is spacious. Bring an extra suitcase so that you can shop till you drop. A great location to base yourself in and explore Boston
6134867,35238087,2015-06-16,21661527,Anthony,"Great location, wonderful beds, great communication. We would highly recommend their place to anyone."
6134867,35412631,2015-06-18,1023606,Billy,"Thank you Jeff for a perfect time! The apartment was pristine. It had everything you could want, even a pack and play for the baby! He also left chocolates, waters and kind bars for our enjoyment."
"We would definitely stay again. Many thanks! \"",,,,,
6134867,36565634,2015-06-29,34257531,Mahdi,"The host was very welcoming and helpful. They helped us get our bags and left us welcome candies and chocolate. If you have a car like us, there was a garage only 2 blocks away and the host helped us in booking a spot and got us the card access. The apartment was clean and tidy, and the kitchen was fully equiped. It was near downtown crossing, so walking everywhere was very easy. They were very flexible regarding the check-in and check-out; had the apartment ready when we wanted it, and postponed the check-out when we told them about our late flight. The host helped us in all our inquiries. Overall, it was a great experience and we would stay there again."
6134867,36886591,2015-07-02,17618253,Andrea,"After staying in a hotel & with family on this trip,  this apartment was a clean little slice of paradise! We were welcomed by waters, granola bars & chocolate, fresh, white towels & toiletries. The feel is hotel-like since it doesn't appear to be lived in,  but more clean & spacious. The hosts supplied helpful items like an umbrella, a playpen, maps, and a fully-equipped kitchen. The front bedroom can be loud at times with the building construction directly across the street & pedestrian traffic, but the massive window provides a great view & my little ones loved it.  There was a market close by,  so we were able to eat in for a couple meals.  We were within walking distance of Little Italy, so we HAD to eat out on occasion. The Thinking Cup around the corner on Tremont was great too.  This place was expensive,  but so much better than a hotel!"
6134867,37389817,2015-07-06,36631817,Rowan,"\"It's great. We love the apartment. The taxi driver kept on saying \"\"It's the downtown of downtown\"\". The apartment is well located and very clean with enough space. We have a child so Jeff is very kind to set us an air mattress. Jeff has a professional service team to wait us until 11 pm. Our first trying of airbnb is amazing."
这是一间小公寓,但住在里面充满了乐趣。它坐落在波士顿市中心的中心。在这次美国之旅期间,这是我认为住过的最像家的地方。即使是迈阿密的枫丹白露酒店(Fontainebleau Hotel)也未曾让我有如此的舒适感。,,,
一切陈设用具都是宜家(IKEA)新购的,非常齐全,风格也很有品味。舒适的大床让我能快速进入梦乡。厨具非常齐全,我甚至还为家人做了两天的早餐。Jeff贴心的为我们在壁橱里准备了各种冲饮,咖啡、红茶。其中还有我最爱的川宁红茶(Twinings),还有2种口味供我选择
房东Jeff有一组非常专业的服务团队,让我们在晚上11点也能顺利入住。Jeff的团队还贴心的为我们加了一张儿童床,让我的小侄女有了2个美妙的夜晚。公寓里一切都非常整洁,甚至就连摆放在床头的洗漱毛巾和香皂都摆放的是如此的整齐。这一切都让我觉得非常开心,服务团队真的非常专业。,
如果再有机会到波士顿,"我一定还会再来Jeff的公寓里做客。\"",,,,
6134867,37815900,2015-07-10,35872648,Chenlu,The apartment is beautifully furnished as shown on the photos! Downtown Crossing subway station is right across the street. Both beds are big enough for 2 people. I booked the apartment just one day before arrival and Jeff was very helpful and responsive!
"One trick to get the key out of the keyhole of the inner door downstairs is to push in the round shape part around the keyhole and pull the key out :D\"",,,,,
6134867,38271207,2015-07-14,10322860,Nick,This place was perfect.
It was within a few minutes walk of practically everything we wanted to see and do. I can't stress this enough,the location is absolutely the best! Restaurants,pubs,coffee shops,Boston attractions,even grocery stores!
Jeff had a key service meet us when  we arrived,the apartment was spotless,and there was guide to explain how everything worked,as well as advice on where to eat etc.,,
We will definitely be coming back to Boston,and we will definitely be staying here again!,,,,
"This was an amazing first airbnb experience.\"",,,,,
6134867,38747489,2015-07-18,13300910,Erek,Jeff's description of the apartment is spot on.  We appreciated the well-equipped kitchen and cleanliness of the apartment.  The key service they use is great and allows for easy check-in and check-out.  Thank you!
6134867,39093359,2015-07-20,37622939,Amy,"Starting with the booking, everything was easy. Key exchange was fast and hassle free. Location was awesome and very convenient and close to restaurants and sites."
6134867,39530668,2015-07-24,908365,Matthew,Jeff was extremely communicated throughout the booking and whilst we were staying in his apartment. The apartment is exactly as it looks in photos and is perfectly located in the centre of boston with really easy access to the transit system. Highly recommended.
6134867,40098676,2015-07-28,34189900,Margot,"I highly recommend this condo for couples or families who want to sightsee/spend some time in the most historic part of Boston.  My husband and I stayed there with our two grandchildren for their first trip to Boston.  The condo is nicely-appointed with two comfortable bedrooms and a full-size, modern kitchen and and a bath off the hallway for easy access from both bedrooms, so it allowed all of us to have some privacy.  Also, all the conveniences are there - I especially appreciated the coffee supplies, and we could easily have cooked full meals there to save money.   But, as other reviews have noted, the biggest plus is its location - literally just a few short blocks to the Boston Commons & Gardens, the beginning of the the Freedom Trail, The Old State House, Faneuil Hall, and an easy, if slightly longer, walk to the North End.   And, it is just steps from almost any subway line you might need to get to points west, Cambridge, the airport, South Station - you can go anywhere you need from here in almost no time at all.  If you are looking for a pleasant, safe alternative to the sky-high hotel rates in one of the most coveted areas for sightseeing in Boston, this is the place!  Would go back in a heartbeat if I ever need to return to the area for a while.  Also, key exchange was a breeze.  Thanks to the owners for making this place available to our family for what might have been an otherwise unaffordable trip for our family!"
6134867,40285928,2015-07-29,37371681,Siming,A clean nice place. Location is great. Concur with other comments.
6134867,40473206,2015-07-31,36900562,Danny,Our host was great and very responsive. I would give him a 10 out of 10. We had no problem gaining access to the unit as well as finding our way around.
6134867,40630068,2015-08-01,37128568,Katie,"Overall the apartment was great, I would stay here again. Great space for our group of 4 and in a great location. It was really nice that he had a professional management company meet us with the keys. We used Jeff's parking spot and could have used a bit more specific info ahead of time on where it was okay to park because some of the garage was marked as reserved - we had to guess but luckily it worked out okay for us. Only complaint about the apartment was the loud construction across the street that woke us up."
6134867,41503574,2015-08-07,39243218,Bethany,The place was lovely to stay and we had a great time. It was very convenient and welcoming.
6134867,42162634,2015-08-11,4547667,Maika,"Central location close to Public Garden, tourist attractions, transit and about 15 min walk or less to anything. Apartment was very clean and tasteful. Portable crib provided was especially helpful."
"Excellent communication with host. Would most definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
6134867,42599518,2015-08-14,3090550,Lixun,"The host was very helpful and accomondating. The location of the place was great. However, if you're driving here, you may want to consider a less central location because the parking spots around the neighborhood are quite expensive. The place was very clean, bright and comfortable."
6134867,42799215,2015-08-15,17218493,Lyndsey,"Appreciate Jeff working with us on a last minute booking four our family of 5 though we did not meet him personally. His apartment was great, as described, clean and perfect for a family. The only drawback to the apartment it that is in a pedestrian zone. Which is not a problem if you arive via taxi, but if you arrive with a vehicle and are not familiar with Boston streets and traffic, both the key exchange and parking are a challenge. The gentleman that met us with the key went out of his way to meet us at a street corner nearby where we could stop for a minute without being harrassed by the police just getting there was a challenge. He recommended we park in a garage at 33 Arch St. It was probably the closest garage and was walking distance, but a total rip off! We ended up paying $71 for less than 24 hrs in the garage. According to the garage attendant the day starts over at 5am. Had we not pulled into the garage until after 5pm it would have been $10 for the overnight until 5am then hourly after that! Recommend not arriving at Jeff's until after 5pm if you have a vehicle, but most importantly avoid the garage at 33 Arch."

6134867,43643468,2015-08-21,38061028,Martyn,"Great place, and very central location. Clean and nicely decorated, would definitely recommend it. Had a hard time finding something in the area with two bedrooms, but this fit the bill perfectly."
6134867,44174299,2015-08-24,3423982,Alexia,"Incredible location, great apartment and wonderful overall experience!"
My husband and I and another couple came to Boston for a friend's wedding. This apartment couldn't have been better. You are dead center in the middle of downtown crossing with shops and restaurants literally steps from your door. We walked the entire city on foot from the apt. The place itself was modern,clean,well equipped and nicely decorated.,,,
We had taken the red eye from California and arrived extremely early into the city. Jeff's management staff worker,Mike was incredibly helpful. We were allowed access to a storage unit to hold our bags and he graciously met us early for a key exchange.,,,,
"I would hands down stay at Jeff's again and definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a true city experience in Boston. \"",,,,,
6134867,45408242,2015-09-02,25665649,G. Myron,Very nice place. Centrally located. Management was great to work with. Would definitely stay again.
6134867,46024361,2015-09-07,41867972,Yuxin,"Jeff apparently did a good job to be a host. He provided me lots of information about the area that we visited ahead of our trip. The location is perfect, and the apartment is newly renovated and quiet enough especially of downtown Boston. Highly recommend for first-time Airbnber!"
6134867,46598417,2015-09-12,17210490,Mike,Great place! Easy. Worked great for us.

6134867,47440716,2015-09-18,24972089,Tim,Had an excellent stay at Jeff's condo.  Great location and great place.  I highly recommend the condo to anyone traveling to Boston.  Thank you again for letting us stay at the condo.
6134867,47732808,2015-09-21,2214150,Benjamin,Great experience. Super location. Flexible and responsive. Place is in a nice building well appointed. Jeff provided us with amenities like water and chocolate on arrival as well as bathroom supplements. Great experience
6134867,47855908,2015-09-21,17780987,Stefanie,"The place was perfect and I will definitely stay again! It was clean, was in the BEST location, and really was the perfect place to stay for my business trip."
6134867,48083672,2015-09-23,4050751,Kyle,"Jeff was a great host, although we never actually met him--thankfully the key/hosting service he uses (BnB Caretakers) was great. The person who met us was kind and professional and made us feel at home. The apartment was clean, stocked with water and snacks, and the kitchen had everything you could need for a few days or even weeks. The only issue we had was with construction noise at the skyscraper being built across the street. Jackhammering at 6:30am made for a scramble to get checked out in time. This was only an issue in the street side bedroom, so a better insulated window or additional noise pane would make this apartment a great place to stay!"
6134867,48562234,2015-09-27,32452898,Tori,"A nice two-bedroom. Interesting commercial building in the middle of Boston Crossing. Centrally located, stores, restaurants, and theater nearby. Easy key exchange."
6134867,48998361,2015-09-30,26370600,Michal,"\"The apartment is a little odd, only one room has a window (unless you counting the one between the bedrooms). Inner \"\"bedroom window\"\" as we now call it means that if one person has a light on then the other bedroom has their light on as well."
The mirror in the bedroom is lovely,"but only possible to use if you are 7\"\" tall.",,,,
We have a small hunch that a massive train station is nearby and there is a lot of street noise as well. That being said,the bathroom is good and it is in a good central location (here we're referring to the flat,not the bathroom). The lady who gave us keys was nice as well.,,,
This is a flat for business visits,"not for vacations.\"",,,,
6134867,49646067,2015-10-05,8846469,Stefan,"We really enjoyed our time at the apartment. It was great. Perfect location, clean rooms. What else to say? Absolutely recommendable."
6134867,49776419,2015-10-06,40116916,Amy,Jeff's place was fantastic! In a great neighborhood near tons of shops and restaurants. And just down the block from numerous train lines. The key exchange was also very easy. I'll definitely plan to stay here if I'm ever in Boston again.
6134867,50292352,2015-10-11,14565672,Tiffany,"We traveled to Boston with another couple and had originally booked a place in the North End through Airbnb. That booking was cancelled, unexplained, and I'm so glad it was. We loved staying at Jeff's place. Not only was he a very thoughtful host and quick to respond to any inquiries, the place was clean, well-decorated and in a super convenient location in Boston. The place was spacious enough for two couples, with the only drawback being there wasn't much common space to hangout besides our bedrooms. We didn't spend much downtime at the apartment anyway, so it was really not a big deal. We arrived in Boston very late, and there was no problem getting into the apartment. I sent Jeff our itinerary and he plugged in some good recommendations for eating and drinking in the areas we'd be visiting. Hosts like Jeff are the reason I so highly recommend using Airbnb to travel!"
6134867,50683879,2015-10-13,14944382,Gabriella,"Väldigt bra lägenhet, rent och snyggt. Bra läge. Nära butiker och restauranger. Kan verkligen rekommendera denna lägenhet."
6134867,51276033,2015-10-19,31610084,Yves,We had a great time at Jeff's apartment. The communication worked perfect and really quick. The modern apartment was in the heart of downtown Boston. Perfect location with plenty of food and shopping around. Thanks for this great AirBnB experince!
6134867,51781311,2015-10-24,8263681,Laura,"I had a great experience with this apartment! I stayed here with my husband and parents while touring Boston and the surrounding area and it was perfectly located. Everything was very clean and the beds were comfortable, which was really appreciated after long days of walking around the city! There was also a really nice chocolate bar and some Kind bars waiting for us when we arrived, which was a nice touch."
We didn't get to meet Jeff personally,but the check-in process was really simple. Jeff uses a company that sends someone to meet you with the key at the agreed upon time. Our flight ended up being delayed,and then delayed further,and then delayed again...I was in touch with the company throughout and they were extremely understanding and accommodating,even when our final arrival time was pushed back to after 10pm.,
The only small downside is that as there is a building being constructed across the street,"the front bedroom gets a pretty early wake-up call due to the construction. I recommend putting the lighter sleepers in your group in the other room!\"",,,,
6134867,52128911,2015-10-26,45910232,Tony,"Nice apartment, perfectly located in Downtown Crossing. There's not a lot of common space for hanging out but it's a quick walk to most of Boston's historic sites and right across the street from the T and a lot of shopping options. If your plans are to be out and about in Boston as much as possible, this is a great deal and I would definitely recommend it."

6134867,57219523,2015-12-23,31829111,Erin,"The apartment is very nice and the hosts know how to make you feel welcome. It's in Downtown Crossing, the middle of a shopping area. The street is pedestrian only during the day, so you'll have to walk one or two blocks if you come by cab. Short walk to South Station, Beacon Hill, Chinatown, and not too far from the harbor and North Point. Perfect location for our purposes. Hosts leave fresh towels, soap, shampoos, water and granola bars for you. Everything worked exactly as described. Check in and check out was painless."

The apartment is at the very center of Boston, which basically means it's close to everything. I really like this apartment. And I will recommend it to anyone who comes to Boston!"
6134867,58625365,2016-01-03,50327684,Tamar,The host made us feel very welcome. He has provided complimentary water bottles and candy bars. He also had also provided travel sized toiletries and towels for each guest.

There was coffee, tea, bottled water, Kind bars and chocolate waiting for us.  The apartment is actually nicer than the photos.  It's super clean and it's recent renovation was with high end finishes.  It's got a quiet, peaceful feeling.  The neighborhood, Downtown Crossing, is extremely convenient.  The T is a few blocks away. I would absolutely stay here again.  The only thing to keep in mind is that the street is pedestrian only until 6:00.  At that time taxis are allowed on it.  If you're driving research garage parking before you arrive because its pricey."

There was a pack-n-play available, which would've been nice to know in advance.  I'm guessing a previous guest just bought one and left it.  One thing to note is that there's a window between the two bedrooms (up high, above the closets).  It's not a huge deal but could be a problem people don't go to bed at the same time or if you are trying to put kids down early."

There is a great grocery store just around the corner that has everything you could possibly need. The best part about the apartment is the location. It is located right near several T stops and also is a very short walk to the train station (we took the train to visit colleges in Worcester), so it was very easy to get around without a car. We loved staying right in the heart of the city with so much to see and do. I took my younger daughter to the New England Aquarium on one of the days and we were able to easily walk there."

6134867,74360597,2016-05-15,56977799,Rosanne,"\"Nice decor, comfortable beds. Located right in the heart of the city. Literally above the Gap Factory store. Note that there is no vehicle traffic on the road where the apartment is located so you may have to walk with your suitcases about a block or so. Starbucks coffee was a nice addition. Could have used paper plates and napkins and perhaps a kitchen towel.  Had a slight issue with some late night \"\"entertainment\"\" beneath our window at midnight"
6134867,75119757,2016-05-19,10548112,Liam,I love the apartment. Everything is decorated nicely and kept clean. The location is perfect for convenient access to other locations.
6134867,76093684,2016-05-24,60429780,Klaus,Very good place to stay in Boston. Nice apartment.
Super well organised and spotless clean. Location is very easy and getting around is no problem as you can almost walk everywhere,,,,,

At our arrival,someone was there to welcome us and give us the keys.,,,,
Good advise for the parking.,,,,,
"Thanks a lot! Would rent again.\"",,,,,
6134867,77898843,2016-06-04,48449063,Keng,The check-in process is very smooth. The room is beautiful and spacious. The best part is its location. It is located right at the downtown which is very convenient to go around.
6134867,78767928,2016-06-09,54113044,Caroline,"Jeff,s apartment was smashing !  Central area to stay in, greatly equipped - perfect for a city break."
Would definitely recommend!,,,,,
We got stuck in traffic so arrived much later than expected.  The lady who was greeting us was very understanding and easy to keep updated with re our arrival!,,,,,
"Hope to be back.  Loads more to see !\"",,,,,
6134867,79310811,2016-06-12,20168456,Beth,"This apartment is in a perfect location! Central to north end, south end, beacon hill, Boston Commons and the Freedom trail!!"
The beds were cozy,the shower nice and the kitchen stocked with equipment. The market was literally around the corner- once at the location(it's downstairs!),and mostly quiet.,,,
I recommend bringing earplugs though it's mostly quiet- I could hear workmen across Washington St and a neighbor in their kitchen my first morning... Neither a big deal but feel the need to mention.,,,,,
Also,there is no living room. We were out and about most of our stay,so this was not a problem for us. We found the space comfortable and met our needs nicely!,,,
We would return,"for sure!\"",,,,
6134867,80083766,2016-06-16,15140934,Emily,Very clear and prompt communication. The management company was very accommodating. The apartment was clean and tidy and the location is incredibly convenient to all downtown spots and for accessing the surrounding areas.
6134867,80778955,2016-06-19,16046323,Irene,"If you are visiting Boston and want a convenient, beautiful place to stay - this can't be beat. The apartment is exactly as listed - gorgeous and newly renovated. It had all of the amenities expected and more. The host did an excellent job making us feel welcome - they left snacks and water and a nice packet describing the area and things to do. I would definitely use this apartment again."
6134867,81097751,2016-06-21,77739465,Paulette,"Right at Downtown Crossing this is an excellent location. The rooms were very clean. There were treats and water to welcome us. The view was great. Communication was timely and the meet up to get the key went smoothly. I would definitely stay here again as it was safe, comfortable and centrally located."
6134867,81353249,2016-06-22,6065829,Peter,Nice apartment in tall building along a major shopping area. Stayed two nights for a conference and fit the bill well. Close to the park and transit.
6134867,82013348,2016-06-26,1621087,Jennifer,"My friend and I stayed at Jeff's place for 3 nights and overall the stay was just OK. Based on the other reviews I think we had some bad luck - the key pick handover was a bit confusing and required a lot of communicating/effort on our part and when we arrived one of the bedrooms had a slight but bothersome smell of cigarette smoke, which lingered there for most of the visit.  I communicated all of this with Jeff and to his credit he was very responsive and accommodating. He offered to send a caretaker to clean the place but by that point we were most of the way through our visit and decided to just clean the room ourselves. Honestly, I think this was more of an issue with Air bnb service/handlers. On the place itself - the place is as described and in a convenient location. I will say that the walls are pretty thin so one can easily hear noise from other tenants. Not the biggest deal for me as I am a deep sleeper but bothersome for my friend."
Overall OK visit and while we would not stay here again I would say that the fact that most of the reviews are positive means that we likely had some bad luck. Again,"Jeff is great and I am sure he is working to ensure that the issues we had will not happen with other guests.\"",,,,
6134867,83910750,2016-07-04,43044671,Sasha,The apartment was incredibly clean (and comfy!) and in a great location. The management company was super accommodating with adjusting my check in/check out time and answering all of my questions. Would definitely stay here again.
6134867,85536823,2016-07-11,74805240,David,Great location!  Close to a nice grocery store.  The rooms are clean and good size for my family.  Good choice for Boston.
6134867,87202845,2016-07-19,39909228,Figen,"The apartment was clean and equipped well . The apartment was in a secure building at the heart of the city . Close to the shops , near the subway . Everythig was near to us ."
Some forks were missing our host send us immediatly. there were clean towels and soap shampoo in the apartment .,,,,,
With the 2 king size beds we comfortable . Only one bed was a little bit short for the tall peaple.,,,,,
Very good apartment for Boston . If I go Boston again I will stay again in this apartment .,,,,,
Every thing was very ok .,,,,,

The apartment was bright and spacious for our needs with a new kitchen which was stocked with drinking water for us on arrival. The management company we engaged with were very accommodating in our check in and check out,"they met us early to facilitate a bag drop and managed to get us a late check out when we were leaving. We would definately recommend staying here for a visit to Boston!!\"",,,,
6134867,89033548,2016-07-26,4962422,Josh,Perfect location to jump on the freedom trail and explore historic Boston sites. Very clean and comfortable apartment. Super cold air conditioning in the middle of July was very welcome. Despite the urban location it was very quiet in the apartment and we slept great! Parking is a challenge.
6134867,89447396,2016-07-28,63388897,Emma,Excellent location and really nice apartment! Contact with the host and the caretaker company was perfect. Highly recommended!

Getting in and out was super convenient, parking was close by and the apartment is walking distance to literally everything you want to see in Boston. Thanks Jeff for a wonderful first Air BnB experience, we would stay here over and over again :)"
6134867,91631536,2016-08-06,74606556,Amy,This was a great place to stay in Boston. We would have needed two hotel rooms so this was better value and it was useful to have a kitchen as we were travelling with our baby. I don't think it was advertised but there was a travel cot in the apartment which was handy. Check-in was easy and the location was perfect. We were able to walk pretty much everywhere we wanted to see. I'd definitely recommend the apartment.
6134867,92032739,2016-08-07,14590914,Nicole,Great apartment! Super comfy bed. Right in the thick of it in Boston.
6134867,94494847,2016-08-15,54814848,Thierry,"Pleasant stay in downtown Boston, everything walk distance. Nice supermarket with everything you need in next street. Description and pictures perfectly in line with the reality."
6134867,95689880,2016-08-20,37108920,Xijia,"Jeff's place pretty much was the best among all places my family have stayed during our 20 days of a all-over-the-US trip. Perfect location to experience Boston right from its heart, while convenience for either foods or shopping or traffic providing you with a cozy stay."
The place is super clean and perfectly equipped even with snacks as a welcome,and the bright view as well as comfortable beds are definitely are a big bonus. The check-in was smooth despite the fact that we arrived an hour earlier than our set-up time.,,,,
The only problem was the bathroom door which locks itself due to the unchanged broken handle from outside,"but the management team and especially Jeff himself were really responsive and had someone sorted it out even at late hours. We really appreciate it!\"",,,,
6134867,98607521,2016-08-31,6081990,Darcy,"Jeff's place in downtown crossing could NOT be in a better location. My daughter and I had a great 5 days. The apartment was comfortable, clean and extra props to the woman who met us (in the middle of the night) to give us the key and orientation. We were blown away by everything. We highly recommend Jeff's place."
1497879,7044062,2013-09-04,3336443,Pavel,We stayed a few days at Sara's place and we had a very nice time. The neighbourhood is very quiet with a nearby park and great Italian restaurant and bakery just around two corners ;)
The room itself is nicely decorated with a spacious bed. Even though there is no real kitchen,there is a microwave,fridge and electric kettle,"so it is easy to have a breakfast in the morning. Communication with Sara was very efficient. We can definitely recommend her.\"",,
1497879,7151470,2013-09-08,4470792,Mechele,I had a very nice stay with Sara. This room is like having your own apartment! It's perfect for a restful evening. Sara also made it very special with a fully stocked kitchenette. I would return in a heartbeat.
1497879,7178938,2013-09-09,7138194,Lena,"We really enjoyed our (unfortunately very short) stay at Sara's apartment! The room is very clean and cozy and Sara put a lot of effort into making it comfortable for her guests: the bathroom and kitchenette are very well equipped, there is lots of information about Boston for tourists and Sara even let us use her washing machine/dryer when we arrived. I would definitely recommend her place!"
1497879,7201863,2013-09-10,3455513,Aidan,"We only stayed in Sara's basement apartment for one night just before a flight out of Boston, but we had a lovely relaxing time. While the basement is small, the room contains everything you need for a pleasant stay; own bathroom, kitchenette (coffee and tea, microwave, minibar fridge), iron and ironing board, couch, writing desk, TV, and of course a comfortable double bed. The shower is even stocked with a range of shampoos, conditioners and body washes."
We were surprised at how nice the local area was. Take a walk to the waterfront and visit Piers Park on the reclaimed wharf for a great view of Boston,and check out the East Boston Greenway,a strip of park where the old railway used to run. And it's only a single train stop away from the airport in one direction,and the city in the other.,,
"Sara is very quick to respond to emails and is a very gracious host. We would not hesitate to stay here again!\"",,,,,

1497879,7439856,2013-09-20,8248748,Alina,"We stayed at Sarah's place  for 2 nights. The studio is located in the basement of a house. Apartment is very clean, cozy, well-appointed."
Common hallway and stairs in the house a little spoiled impression they are old and not very clean.,,,,,
In the studio there is no real kitchen,but there is a mini-kitchen: fridge,electric kettle,microwave and coffee machine.,,
The bathroom new and clean,well equipped. There's even a first aid kit with necessary details.,,,,
The great advantage of this apartment  is washing machine and dryer. Do not waste time going to laundry!,,,,,
"We were a little scared of information about parking: \"\"the closest parking  it's valet-parking at the airport.\"\" But it turned out a lot easier! There is a great simple cheap  parking at the nearest metro station.",,,,,
All in all it was a good experience and we give a good recommendation!,,,,,
(sorry for my english,"all claims to the online translator)\"",,,,
1497879,7582343,2013-09-25,8179742,Megaan,This apartment is located very conveniently to both the airport and to all Boston has to offer. Sara was a wonderful host and have us plenty of recommendations of places to visit. She made the space very comfortable and was very quick to respond with any questions we had before and during our stay. I would highly recommend staying here for anyone's visit especially if you are traveling to and from Logan airport.
1497879,7628734,2013-09-27,6303621,Rollo,"We had a very pleasant stay in Sara's basement room. She's really made the most of the space, with lovely furnishings, a comfortable bed and plenty of little extra things (such as a book of personal recommendations) that made one feel right at home."
She also helped us out when we ran into some problems that delayed our check out somewhat,and allowed us to stay until we got ourselves sorted out,"despite the fact a guest was staying the following night. Little things like that leave a positive feeling.\"",,,
1497879,7645956,2013-09-28,795464,Zahid,proche du métro et à une station de l'aéroport ce qui m'a permis d'arriver en peu de temps à l'aéroport
1497879,7678429,2013-09-29,8109237,Janet,"\"Had a great one night stay at Sara's. She is the most accommodating hostess, and was incredibly thoughtful and welcoming. The neighborhood is a bit \"\"in transition\"\" but is really close to the airport and the room was clean"
1497879,7746826,2013-10-01,1292074,Mark & Cathy,"\"This was a great place to stay if you're visiting Boston.  Only a couple of blocks away from Maverick Station and a 10-minute ride on the \"\"T\"\".   Sara was very nice and informative on what to do around the area and the best way to do it.   The only downside was that her place wasn't available the following week when we came back to Boston!  :)\""
1497879,7849777,2013-10-06,7401834,Valeria,"We visited various cities in our holiday and no doubt this was the best apartment. Big enough, beautiful, clean and well cared for! Sara was very nice and accurate and provided us with everything we needed. Located very close to the metro, perfect for exploring Boston."
1497879,7877788,2013-10-07,3804173,Sean,"I was in Boston for a quick overnight stay with a half day of tourist time as part of a long trip and this space could not have been more comfortable, convenient, quiet or ideal. Sara is a most gracious host who has all of her bases covered from coffee in the room to recommendations while in Boston to providing a card for the T (public transit system). For this weary traveler, her hospitality could not have been more welcome. And the room was just perfect!  Thank you so much, Sara.  I hope to see you and this spectacular city again soon!"
1497879,7927748,2013-10-08,1571101,Tyler,I was only in Boston for a short while but Sara made my one night stay very comfortable. Her place is very nice and well stocked with many things that a careless packer like me forgot.
If I'm ever in the Boston area again,"I know where I'm staying!\"",,,,
1497879,8043687,2013-10-14,1763529,Mary,"We stayed here 4 nights and found it to be comfortable and that it met all our needs.  Sara was warm and welcoming and had many little extra goodies available, such as granola bars and specialty coffees.  It was very quiet because the bedroom suite is in the basement and towards the back.  The only negative was that the stairs down are a bit steep and fairly tricky to manage with suitcases, but Sara did offer to help.  The best part for us was the use of her washer and dryer so we could have clean clothes when we got on the cruise ship at the end of our stay there.  The other perk was the Italian Express Pizzeria just around the corner.  They have an extensive menu, not just pizza, and everything we had (2 nights we ate there) was delicious, with huge servings.  Share a salad and an entree and you will be full!  The subway stop at Maverick Square is very convenient, and getting a pass makes it all very easy - you can get everywhere on the subway.  We also did 2 walking tours using Free Tours On Foot, and they were so excellent.  All you do is tip at the end.  Look at their tours online.  We also enjoyed the Sam Adams Brewery tour, with 3 big beer tastes at the end - free."
1497879,8115988,2013-10-16,3224863,Emily,"This was the perfect spot for us to relax and crash for the night. Sara was very friendly and accommodating. The suite has a separate entrance from her apartment so we didn't feel like we were intruding at all- very private. There are a lot of materials on local attractions as well as toiletries and breakfast supplies on hand. We found this area to be safe yet still full of local flavor, not at all like an anonymous hotel! It was an easy trek to the T. The bed is nice and firm. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an economical and pleasant place to stay."
1497879,8169238,2013-10-19,6202966,Anton,"Great little place, very close to downtown and close to transport and the airport. Sara was very accommodating and friendly and provided some good tips for what to see. Would definitely recommend Sara's place to others."

1497879,8276558,2013-10-23,8488366,Eric,Sara's place is beyond accommodating and filled with all the essentials you sometimes miss at home. She was incredibly flexible with my check-in time and she could not have been more informative in answering any questions I had with travelling around Boston. Thanks for a wonderful experience!
1497879,8405657,2013-10-29,7574502,David,"Sara's flat was very convenient, private & comfortable. I would stay there again without hesitation."

Basement, but clean comfortable and cute. Excellent proximity to the airport I had a comfortable stay and would certainly recommend."
1497879,8711216,2013-11-12,9834124,Rachel,"My friend and I made a last minute trip to boston and needed a place to stay. Sarah was very helpful and accommodating. The check-in and checkout process was very simple, and the place was very close to the airport. Would stay with Sara again if in Boston and highly recommend her place."

Be sure to check out KO at the Shipyard for some yummy meat pies, that was probably my favorite walk (sunset across the skyline) out of the whole trip."
1497879,8828355,2013-11-19,2680072,Alexander,Sara did a great job. Never seen such a well prepared room with many little things a guest might have forgotten for the trip but which are as well simply helpful like the tea and coffee selection. Sara prepared as well a list of sights worth to see in Boston with additional information - very well done. The walls are a bit paper thin. I did not have any problem with that but anyone who wants to hear music or watch TV a bit louder or talk late at night might opt for a place with better walls to prevent to bother neighbours.
1497879,8882423,2013-11-24,6709317,Marsha,"Suite as advertised...location could not have been more convenient to airport or downtown.  Located in a working class neighborhood with transportation, coffee, restaurants, small markets and stores.  Sara met me and introduced the suite and the environs.  She provided much info for making my stay fun.  Very comfy.  Beware of narrow stairs while carrying a suitcase but that only happens twice.  Thanks Sara."

I stayed here from Nov. 29th till Dec. 4 and did not have any problems. Omg... the room was cute and cozy which made you feel right at home =) It was honestly close to everything and if you ever need help with anything you can count on Sara. I stayed here with two other friends and we all slept in the same bed"
(because we decided to,there is also a couch that converts to a bed) which the bed was extremely comfertable and the bathroom was clean with fresh towels!! The little fridge,microwave,dryer,"and washer was convenient for us. The only thing I recommend for anyone is that if you are going to be driving around do not count on your gps from your phone..... that was our only little problem.I highly recommend Sara's place to anyone looking for a quiet comfortable room in Boston =) Thank you Sara and Boston was AMAZING!!! =D\"",

Convenient transportation, only a few minutes walk to the nearest subway station, and you can always find food and snacks nearby. Also, Sara is a really nice host, considerate and caring. Anyway, you would love to spend few days here!"
1497879,9767496,2014-01-08,2992681,Sarah,We had a great three nights stay in Sara's little basement suite.
Sara had thought of many helpful details like coffee,shampoo and her list of things to do in Boston. The place is in East Boston and if you walk outside and down the street you have a magnificent view of the Boston skyline from the other side of the water. Also it was really easy to get from Sara's place to the airport the last early morning.,,,,

1497879,9992633,2014-01-23,9401820,Bryan & Julie,Sara could not have been more accommodating as we are standby travelers and we have a difficult time knowing the exact dates needed or times of arrival - she went out of her way to work with us. Her place is as described and could not be any easier to get to from the T - only one stop from the airport. Thank you again Sara.
1497879,10015419,2014-01-25,2626847,Sarah,"The room was just as pictured, very lovely! Sara was very accommodating and offered me the opportunity to leave my luggage there before check-in time. The closet revamped into a mini-kitchenette is such a great idea! I feel right at home in her place."
1497879,10028474,2014-01-26,11449697,Davy,Sara was awesome! I highly recommend a stay here. Its close to the airport and the T. Thank you Sara and we will be staying here on our next stay in Boston!
1497879,10229224,2014-02-08,7739560,Lois,"Sara's place was very convenient for us during our 3 day stay in Boston. It's very near a Maverick T stop, with a great Italian restaurant within walking distance."
1497879,10261278,2014-02-10,9265226,Janis,Great place with easy and fast connection to the airport as well as downtown Boston. Everything was clean and as expected from the description and pictures. I was able to store my luggage during the day after check-out as my flight was in the evening.
"I can recommend this place for your Boston trip!\"",,,,,
1497879,10329687,2014-02-13,6807418,David,"Sara's suite provided a great home base for myself and a colleague. We were in Boston on business and stayed 3 nights. Sara was extremely welcoming and kind. She showed us all the amenities of the bedroom, and even suggested great spots in Boston for photography. The room also featured a well-organized binder filled with information, sights-to-see, etc. In sum, Sara is a very prepared and knowledgeable host with a passion for Boston."
In terms of location,Sara's home is great. Down the street is a park on the water with an incredible view of downtown Boston and the North End. We spent a good amount of time here collecting timelapses. The drive into Boston proper is maybe 10-minutes. Just try not to get lost on Boston's collection of bridges,tunnels,and overpasses.,,
A couple of moot points for us were the size of the room. When the sofa bed is out,the room becomes a bit tight. Add 2 people and 4 pieces of luggage,and you are in for a squeeze. Luckily,we were able to stow some of our baggage into the hallway. Otherwise,walking around would have been a bit of a tetris game. Also,parking is not easy (especially in the snow). Be prepared to circle the block a couple times if you plan on staying out late.
My only other feedback for myself. It's not easy to keep the tile floors clean when the world outside is covered in snow. We did out best to clean up after ourselves. Hopefully,"we did not cause too much extra work for Sara.\"",,,,
1497879,10365313,2014-02-16,4348453,Lindsay,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Sara's apartment. It is in a great location for getting to/from the airport and also to/from Boston. The actual apartment is great as well. It has everything that we needed, and even a surprise closet with a fridge, coffee, etc. She also had phone chargers available in case you forgot yours and all sorts of information on what to do in Boston. I would stay here again and again. Thanks, Sara!"
1497879,10427113,2014-02-18,11450219,Denise,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for President's Day weekend/Valentine's Day. This stay was everything we had hoped for and more! The room was absolutely adorable and looks EXACTLY like the pictures. It was a VERY short walk from the T, and it was close to the airport which made traveling with lots of luggage much easier. Sara was a great host. She very thoroughly explained everything and was very inviting. We kept very much to ourselves, but we really appreciated her hospitality."
"I cannot overstate how great this whole experience was. I hope we get the pleasure of staying in her adorable home if we come back to Boston!\"",,,,,
1497879,10587425,2014-02-26,11127941,Aaron,"Lovely spot, very close to Logan and public transportation.  Great base for exploring Boston!  I second the other glowing reviews here."
1497879,10650145,2014-03-01,8427872,Don,"Sara's place was perfect! We were hoping to have a fun night in the city before catching an early flight the next morning and Sara's suite is perfectly appointed for a nice stay. The room suite is completely segregated from the rest of the house and everything was exceptionally clean. Sara was nice enough to have the bathroom fully stocked with any toiletries we may have forgotten en route, which is just a very thoughtful touch and indicative of someone that really knows how to be a host. Would definitely stay there again!"
1497879,10773149,2014-03-06,8832735,Douglas,Very comfortable bedroom suite near Logan.
Sara worked with my uncertain time of arrival,to ensure I could get in even when she could not meet me there personally.,,,,
It's actually within reasonable walking distance of the airport: ~a mile and a quarter,depending on the terminal. With no luggage to speak of,"I made it each way in under 25 mins. Bonus: a bit of brisk exercise in the 18 degree early March air!\"",,,
1497879,11086690,2014-03-19,12625710,Lindsay,"Sara's Suite was the perfect stop for our one night in Boston, with plenty of room for the three of us! Sara's mom was visiting from out of state, and was there to greet us and get us acquainted with the space when we arrived, the kitchenette was fully stocked with an excellent coffee selection, and the beds were super comfortable - even the pull-out! Thanks again for a great experience!"
1497879,11113375,2014-03-21,11636647,Pj,"Sara's place was in a great convenient location in Boston.  The walk from the metro to the place was close and the check in was smooth.  The place was tidy and there were enough amenities provided.  Although it was in the basement, it still had natural light and felt comfortable.  There was enough space for 2 people.  It was a in a quiet location.  I would definitely stay here again when I am in Boston again!"
1497879,11214821,2014-03-25,9777357,Melissa,My sister and I stayed here for 4 nights.   We arrived before check-in time but Sara was very accommodating. Her Mother was in town and she let us drop off our bags and pick up keys.   The room is just as it is pictured. Very cute and
Comfortable.  Sara had a great supply of coffee and  instant oatmeal for is and the fridge and microwave came in handy.,,,,,
Our walk from maverick Station was 5 minutes max. So convenient to get everywhere on the subway.,,,,,
Our first meal was at Italian Express which one block up and over. Tripadvisor said it was the #10 place to eat in ALL of Boston!  It was super good and affordable. And they deliver!,,,,,
One thing to note is that the stairs to your room are very narrow and steep. Neither of is had a full size suitcase and it was a good thing. Maneuvering our bags down and then up the stairs was the only challenge of our stay.,,,,,
"Overall this was a great value and a wonderful  place to stay. \"",,,,,
1497879,11351012,2014-03-31,11978476,Karla,"Sarah was a great host, the place was private and cozy. I loved how it was so close to the subway station and that made it easy to get around the city."

"Tks Sara!\"",,,,,
1497879,11494083,2014-04-05,9356944,Andrew,"Sara responded to all messages very swiftly. Her location is very convenient to get to from the airport. I especially appreciate all the extra conveniences you might not expect from a smaller place (e.g., small refrigerator and kitchenette area, laundry)."
1497879,11530220,2014-04-07,7247224,Dan,"Excellent place. Great location. Close to airport. Flying in from the uk it cost us less than $10 to get a cab to Sara's place. Also just a 2-3 minute walk to the nearest metro station, 2-3 stops to get downtown. So easy."
Sara really has gone the extra mile with lots of little thoughtful extras that you might need on your trip; a range of toiletries,teas,coffees,oatmeal,fridge,microwave and laundry facilities etc
The basement apartment is cosy and so quiet and peaceful.,,,,,
Thank you Sara.,,,,,

1497879,11591234,2014-04-08,5168666,Jonna,"The place was easy to get to. Sara checked us in. She was very welcoming. If u plan to stay in the apartment for a longer period though, it is noisy and the Internet is really slow. Other than that, it was good."
1497879,11627543,2014-04-09,7167872,Kelly,"We stayed here after a flight in to Boston (it's pretty close by the airport and cheaper than a hotel!).  The room was really nice, clean and Sarah was really helpful!  Only stayed one night, but overall had a good experience and would recommend it over a hotel for a quick stay!"
"\"",,,,,
1497879,11656358,2014-04-11,4239494,Helen,"This was our second Airbnb experience and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sara's.  We arrived from Logan Airport on the subway, all instructions and arrangements were so easy to follow.  Communication with Sara is excellent.  Sara's sister met us and very kindly let us leave our luggage before checking in as we were early."
We met Sara later that evening,she was very friendly and welcoming. The apartment is lovely and clean and very convenient for Boston (one stop away on the subway - which is only a short walk from the apartment) and there are local shops nearby if you need anything.  However,we only needed milk as Sara  had thought of everything to make our stay enjoyable.,,,
You must visit the local park which is a few minutes walk away from Sara's,as the view of Boston's skyline is amazing!  (NB the park was closed after 10pm).  Sara also let us leave our luggage after check-out as we had an evening flight.,,,,
We found the neighbourhood and apartment very quiet would recommend staying at Sara's.,,,,,
Thank you Sara for a comfortable stay!,,,,,

She met us upon check-in, explained all the ins and outs of the place, and gave us a lot of info on how to get around town. She also provided basic necessities (bathroom supplies, laundry supplies, etc) in case we forgot to pack them. Room was clean and exactly as described.  We only stayed for one night, but it was still a great experience."

She had a comprehensive binder of pretty much anything you would need to know about the apartment or Boston/getting around. The location was great! A few minutes from Maverick Station which from there was no more than 10-15 minutes to get downtown Boston. Everything was clean and prepared. I would definitely stay again.

1497879,13745912,2014-06-03,2801263,Kathleen,"Sara's suite is definitely a great location for the airport. A $10 taxi ride or one stop on the T. Since we were returning from a month in Europe, our suitcases were pretty heavy. We used a suggestion from an earlier post and left our largest suitcase upstairs because the stairs are fairly steep. The room has lots of space,comfortable bed, good wifi, tv and even a mini kitchen with microwave and electric kettle. There is a private bathroom also. Sara is very organized and helpful.

The apartment is just as it appears in the pictures and ultimately it is your own place as it has a separate entrance to Sara's apartment. The bedroom was lovely and we really appreciated the fridge and tea/coffee facilities for breakfast. The location of Sara's apartment is perfect, it is literally a 2/3 minute walk to the Maverick subway stop (one down from the airport) and the next stop on is Aquarium, from which you can walk basically anywhere in the city. The street was lovely and quiet, which we really appreciated after a long day of sightseeing! I would most definitely recommend Sara's apartment to anyone wanting to stay and explore Boston."

Sara is a kind host and I think washing machine and dryer are really nice service(even powder!). Only one thing I didn't like is that it's located in a basement so I could feel the smell of basement a little bit and couldn't get sunshine in the morning. Overall, it was fine place:)"

The close proximity to the airport and quiet neighborhood make it a fine place to stay. There are numerous restaurants within a short walk. I went to the Tacqueria Cancun and it was great. The metro system is easily accessible and proved to be the best way to get back to the airport.

1497879,18516494,2014-08-28,10758012,Stefanie,"We really like to stay at Sara's accomodation. We've never met her in person but her mum showed us around and was very nice and helpful. The room is really big and nicely decorated, the bed very comfortable and you have also your private little bathroom."
The location is really great: Its near the airport and near Boston city center and there is also a very nice park (5 minute walk) where you have the best view of Boston's skyline.,,,,,
"We would definitely recommend this accomodation! \"",,,,,
1497879,18645011,2014-08-30,10376111,Massimo,"Sara è stata gentile, puntuale e affidabile. La camera è spaziosa e tranquilla, il bagno piccolino ma c'è tutto. Posizione comodissima per l'aeroporto, come indicato nell'annuncio, ma anche il centro si raggiunge in poche fermate di metro."
1497879,18797646,2014-09-01,10300562,Denis,"Sara è veramente un'ottima host. L'appartamento è molto pulito, ordinato, e organizzato di tutto, dal forno a microonde al frigo, dal sapone allo shampoo agli asciugamani."
Perfino caffè e altro per colazione.,,,,,
Il quartiere è molto tranquillo,a pochissimi minuti dal centro in metro.,,,,
Sara è molto disponibile e organizzata,predisponendo tutte le informazioni di cui si hanno bisogno,tra cui piantine e un perfino un quaderno con tutte le informazioni su dove mangiare,i prezzi,le cose da vedere e alcuni consigli.,
Ci siamo trovati veramente bene,"e lo consiglio vivamente a tutti.\"",,,,
1497879,18948271,2014-09-03,18762888,Rachel,We had a great stay in East Boston. Sara's place looks just like the pictures and was exactly what we were expecting from her description. Sara was friendly and helpful in greeting us and making sure we were all set. I was most impressed with how she was flexible with our arrival and departure times. She was very accommodating!
1497879,19364526,2014-09-11,18111850,Julien,"Sara is a wonderful host ! She was very responsive and helpful from the  booking to our departure. She even wrote tourism advices on the surroundings and collected map and information leaflet on Boston.  Her appartement is great, comfy and really separated from the house."
The location is perfect,very close from the metro and the airport. Just the perfect location to explore the city !,,,,
"I really hope Sara's place will be available if I come back to Boston :)\"",,,,,
1497879,19414073,2014-09-12,16971237,Hannah,"Our flight was very delayed, and Sara was very accommodating.  She gave very thorough instructions so we were able to get in smoothly.  We were only in the space for about 8 hours, but we were pleased with our time there."
1497879,19875190,2014-09-20,9061335,Melissa,Love that the location was so close to a park and the T. Easy to get to around especially to the airport. Sara was a great host and provided easy access to all the information that will make your stay in Boston easy.
1497879,19935908,2014-09-21,18985856,Hannah,"Sara was very accommodating with the check in and check out times. She is very friendly and provided lots of maps and books on things to do in the city. Everything looks as it appears in the pictures. The apt is very close to the T with a short walk. The neighborhood itself seemed a little sketchy, we didn't want to walk from the T back to the apt late at night so we took an Uber cab which was really inexpensive. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend to anyone who needs to be close to the airport."
1497879,20023161,2014-09-22,19259468,Lisa,"Sara was a pleasure to work with and the apartment is super cute and comfortable.  We stayed just one night in order to be close to the airport but Sara has thoughtfully provided everything a tourist might need.  Maps, books on Boston, a list of local stores/restaurants.  The apartment was quiet and very clean and bright.  It couldn't be in a more convenient location!  A block from the T, one stop from the airport."
1497879,20280411,2014-09-27,18069651,Brandon,We had a great time and the location of Sara's place was really convenient to the subway and restaurants. She made many suggestions on where to go and a very helpful folder with a lot of information. The place was very cozy for 3. We would definitely use again!
1497879,20898079,2014-10-07,18982964,Karen,Unfortunately we did not meet Sara but communicated via text. Sara accommodated our need to leave our luggage at the flat before check in.
The location was ideal for our early morning flight out of Boston and the T stop at Maverick was an easy walk.,,,,,
The flat was functional and private. We felt more attention to cleaning was needed.,,,,,
It was nice to have a coffee maker,tea kettle,microwave,refrigerator and toaster and Sara provides tea,coffee pods,"etc. The wi-fi service was sketchy as we were only able to connect once during our three days there. \""
1497879,21201277,2014-10-13,729447,Jay,We really enjoyed our short stay in Sara's apartment.  She has thought of nearly every detail in setting it up.  It is an short ride on the nearby subway to downtown.  Sara was very responsive in email and very friendly in person.
1497879,21746329,2014-10-23,18639713,Frank,"Unfortunately due to health reasons we were only able to communicate with Sara via sms but those messages and the accommodation she provided was excellent! It was a unique little set-up, offering everything we required for comfort and convenience. Close to public transport and private entry allows freedom to come and go with little or no intrusion."
1497879,21781659,2014-10-24,2587686,G.,"This was my first Airbnb experience and wasn't sure what to expect. Communication with Sara before our stay was quick and helpful. Her instructions regarding directions, check-in and check-out were clear. Sara greeted us at check-in and showed us around. The accommodations were just as pictured and described in the listing. We only stayed for one night. The space is private and we felt safe. Sara has prepared the space with a traveler in mind, including small touches like a well stocked bathroom, a mini fridge & microwave, and a coffee machine. We walked from the T station to the house in approximately 5 minutes. There are several restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood and house were quiet at night. The only very minor annoyance was the barking of an enthusiastic dog somewhere in the building early in the morning."
1497879,21943405,2014-10-27,19785528,Jose Edwin,El apartamento está perfecto. Es tranquilo y está muy cerca de la ciudad y el aeropuerto. Recomendable.
1497879,22093757,2014-10-29,22488375,Kayla,"Sara was beyond nice and very helpful with allowing us to drop off our bags the morning before checkin with a small fee. Her place was clean and very comfortable, perfect for being able to fly out very seems least the next morning. Thank you so much again for our last minute request, the neighborhood was very safe and close to the T. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here!"
1497879,22229170,2014-11-02,12920446,Tim,"We arrived on Friday night to be met by Sara.  Everything was perfect and Sara gave us the full tour of the apartment.   The apartment was a perfect retreat for us and Sara made us feel at home.  It is exactly as described.   As well, Sara gave us a rundown of the area and some good advice on local restaurants."
In fact,there are many excellent restaurants within minutes (walking) from the apartment and don’t forget to go to Maverick Square for some delicious pastries and coffee.,,,,
The apartment is very well situated within minutes of the “T”.,,,,,
"We had no trouble parking our car out front of the apartment and since it was the weekend we did not have to worry too much about moving it.\"",,,,,
1497879,22382070,2014-11-04,22359208,Emily,Me and my friend stayed to Sara's apartment only one night. The apartment was amazing and Sara is helpful. She's a really good host and person! Thanks for all! ;)))
1497879,22435243,2014-11-06,22421241,Kori,Great host! Very accommodating to our late night arrival. Perfect location for travel from Boston-Logan airport. Sara provides additional information for the area to enhance your stay.

The place looks like the pictures and is in an excellent location! She allowed my brother to leave his bags after check out time because he had a later flight. Thanks Sara for an awesome stay!"
1497879,22657673,2014-11-11,19205011,Cynthia,"Sara was very easy to communicate with and responsive over text.  The directions to her apartment were clear and accurate.  The blue line is very close by, and made access to downtown Boston very convenient. The apartment itself was just as advertised: plenty of space, private bathroom, laundry, and kitchenette in the main bedroom closet.  Another great thing about Sara's place: it is right around the corner from beautiful Piers Park, with amazing views of the city, a giant playground for kids, and lots of nice seating to watch the boats go by."
1497879,22825919,2014-11-16,10479323,Alexis,"Sara was a very laid-back person and easy to get along with. She gave great instructions on how to navigate the city. The apartment was in a good area close to the airport and close to the train station. Apartment was a good size, especially for two people. I found it difficult to sleep because there was this annoying dog who would bark for hours in the morning. It was also oddly colder in one room than the rest of the apartment."
1497879,22923346,2014-11-17,18608703,Desiree,Sara was very welcoming! We were thrilled to have a warmed and cozy room awaiting us after a late flight!  It is exactly as described! Very charming! We will definitely seek Sara out for an AirBnB stay for future Boston trips!

It was in a perfect location, just a short walk to the train station and not even a 5min ride into the heart of Boston. Great place to stay if you are looking for the true Boston feel!"
1497879,23557348,2014-12-04,5641949,Steve,Sara was great!  Her place was clean and easy to find.  The location was very convenient- ~3min from Logan Airport.  She was helpful and helping me find the place- very positive experience!
1497879,23906698,2014-12-14,22457896,Philip,Everything was fine! We didn't meet her personally but due to very good instructions it was very easy to get all things done. Apartment was tidy and everything was ready for us to sleep. We had plenty of room for our group and it was a pleasure to stay in her apartments which was just a couple of metres away from a perfect skyline view.
1497879,24065919,2014-12-18,23131792,Kathy,"Very nice place, comfortable and quiet with everything I needed. The location was perfect for getting to both downtown and the airport. Sara was an awesome host, very helpful."

1497879,25184528,2015-01-08,13281970,Judy,"\"Sara let me in and showed me around my little home for the next 3 days.  She was a gracious hostess.  Everything was spic and span and nicely decorated.  Bed very comfortable and amenities plentiful.  Loved the tiny \"\"kitchen\"\" in the closet. Neighborhood was great from the amazing view of Boston skyline from Pier's Park to the great coffee and breakfast sandwiches at Boston Brewin just a few blocks away at 154 Maverick.  And very quiet.  Maverick station a short walk and therefore easy to get to Boston or the airport.  I highly recommend it.\""
1497879,25289976,2015-01-11,25472496,Jillian,"Sara was a wonderful host. She was full of information about the area. The place was great! Lots of space and very close to the T subway station. Also, Sara has provided many perks such as a coffee, toiletries, DVD player with movies, etc. (Good Will Hunting was perfect for our Boston trip!). I highly recommend staying at her location if you are looking for a homey, private place to stay."
"Sara - Thank you again for the great hospitality! \"",,,,,

She was very welcoming with an informative binder providing tips for how to enjoy the city! The apartment is as it appears in the pictures, very neat and tidy. There were two of us and Sara had a separate bed set up and ready for us when we arrived. The neighbourhood also felt safe and was extremely convenient for hopping on the T to the downtown core, or to the airport stop on the Blue line to catch the free shuttle to our terminal."
1497879,26077353,2015-02-02,26178900,Judy,Sara was extremely accommodating and made this a very positive first experience with airbnb. She graciously answered my many questions. The bed was very comfortable and the location was excellent for going to and from the airport as well as downtown.
1497879,26123797,2015-02-03,8349172,Kelly,Great access to the airport.  Our flight was delayed a day Sara's place was cozy and a good place to hunker down in a snow storm. It is a basement apt. but has nice personal touch.  Appreciate the coffee and oatmeal etc. We would stay again. Thank you Sarah!
1497879,26587495,2015-02-16,11860109,Paul,"made to feel really welcome,and was given full information about the apartment and area. it was a shame that there was so much snow with more expected so couldn't appreciate the area. It was close to the MBTA so could get to downtown and back to the airport very easily. very comfortable apartment, with coffee machine microwave and fridge. great italian restaurant round the corner. thank you sara for a great visit thanks also for the comprehensive visitor folder"

1497879,26807943,2015-02-19,26295233,Yutao,Sara was super accommodating and helpful. Our flight was delayed and she made sure everything was OK and waited until we got there safe and sound. She gave us lots of useful tips on the neighborhood and tours around Boston.
The place was just a few minutes walk to the T. The rooms are clean and warm. Sara even prepared 2 electric heaters for us just in case the apartment heating wasn't enough.,,,,,
Thanks Sara! I would definitely stay there again.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1497879,27205192,2015-02-28,6720024,John,"Sara's downstairs apartment was great for my 3 day visit. It's very clean and the bed was perfect. Quiet apt and quiet neighborhood. The walk to Maverick Sq for the T was indeed 5 min max. Visitors should note that the Maverick T stop is only one stop from Logan airport, so you can't get more convenient than that. Sara was available to help whenever I had a question and was responsive to all my messages. Overall, an A+ experience for me."
1497879,27421441,2015-03-03,8987150,Jet,"We needed a place to stay in east Boston on very short notice. Sara responded to my request within 20 minutes and made the effort to arrange the check-inn that evening, thanks Sara! The apartment was nice and big and included everything we needed. It was very cold and the heating was not working properly, but Sara made sure we would not get cold. She put Spaceheaters in the room and extra sheets on the bed."
We enjoyed our stay!,,,,,

1497879,27931376,2015-03-15,18456186,Raymund,Sara was a great host. She is very clear when giving instructions which made the process very smooth. She definitely seems like an experienced host.
"Her apartment is much larger than i expected and can very comfortably fit 4 people.  It's also right by the maverick train station making it very easy to get around boston.\"",,,,,

1497879,28298706,2015-03-22,10262635,Christina,Great stay! Sara was so nice and had everything ready for us. The bed and futon were both comfy enough. This locations proximity to the train station was perfect for us. No trouble parking in this neighborhood either. I would definitely come back. Thank you!
1497879,28596989,2015-03-27,24057538,Cihan,"The description in the advertisement was excellent. Sara's instructions, the very useful manual she prepared for us, the coziness of the apartment and the many many amenities made us feel home. The neighborhood is clean, safe and quite. The metro is just three minutes away. Downtown Boston is just 10-15 mins away. The airport is also very close by (15 to 30 mins in total). Great experience! I very much recommend this apartment!"
1497879,29073663,2015-04-03,29939557,David,"Sara was great...showed us around the apt as soon as we arrived. Everything looked like the pictures...very nice.  Comfortable, and with lots of nice little extras. My only complaints are minor. The wi-fi had some problems and cut off at times. Also, because we were there on a Thursday when they do street cleaning I had to get up very early to move my car and it took quite awhile to find a spot. This is not under Sara's control of course. Overall, a very nice experience!"
1497879,29528982,2015-04-08,30354275,Lee,"I had a pretty crazy (and ever-changing) schedule but Sara was flexible and made it easy to coordinate! The place was clean, quiet, and exactly as described. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to explore the neighborhood so can't speak much to that."

1497879,30078553,2015-04-17,12528117,Cris,"Sara was a good communicator, making our visit easy and fun. Excellent directions to get there by foot, told us of late night pizza place 5 mins away, she even hauled my huge heavy bag up the stairs before I could stop her. Clean and comfy room."
1497879,30533377,2015-04-23,31421397,Andres,"The apartment was very clean, all was like the description said, the apartment has a comple stuff... the only problem is that the internet connection some times is very slow and there was a leak in the bathroom."
1497879,30573353,2015-04-24,5962862,Mary,"\"Pros: Sara is prompt, responsive, polite and helpful, especially for a short notice request. The location is great, close to the T and the airport, in a safe neighborhood.  The description is spot on, but the furniture is in a slightly different arrangement from the photos.  The guest information book and the takeout menus were a lifesaver, as my husband and I arrived (easily by Uber from the airport) past 1am and were starving! (The Chinese Dragon delivered exactly on time and was pretty tasty.)  The \"\"kitchen closet\"\" had flatware that the restaurant forgot to give us.  There's an extra sitting room with a futon and a basket with a ton of helpful tourist information.  We loved watching Netflix on the Roku while eating our late dinner.  Sara has a fun"
Cons: When we finally settled in for bed around 3am,we pulled back the fluffy comforter to discover what looked like old sheets.  They looked like they'd been washed,but were severely pilled and discolored in some areas.  We ended up sleeping on top of the flat sheet,which looked clean and more crisp.  The room is chilly (which is probably great in the summer!).  We were provided an effective space heater but it was a bit loud,so it woke me a few times when it switched on throughout the night.,
"Thank you for hosting us on such short notice and providing such spot on information for our first airbnb experience!\"",,,,,
1497879,30668046,2015-04-26,21955507,Nicole,Sara was great to communicate with. Her place is as pictured. It is close to the airport and was great for a stopover. The stairs down are not the ones pictured however they are tight with suitcases.
1497879,31311950,2015-05-04,28878250,Paul,"As long as you plan to use the public transport this location could not be better. Close to airport but no noise from it, just two stops from central Boston, was perfect for us as we were out all day. However, if you plan to spend a lot of time where you stay this may not be for you as it is a basement, no openable window, strong smell of cat ( we own and love cats but this was a little strong for us). That said Boston is very expensive and this room reasonably priced for Boston. Kitchen area is microwave and kettle. Washer and drier we did not use but look impressive. If room had been cleaner and without cat smell would of given a 4 star review."
1497879,31499846,2015-05-05,5960468,Dan,"I had planned on short 2 day notice(with +2 guests) to reserve a spot in Sara's AirBnB. Her place was very clean and cozy. She did a professional job in having amenities such as laundry, TV,  toaster/microwave, and plenty of guides for Boston."

The room and bathroom were just as described and allowed us a fantastic stay in Boston.  Very comfortable bed and the room was nicely decorated.,,,,,
3 min walk to T and so convenient to city centre ( 2 stops to State) but also very convenient for airport (just one stop away by T),,,,,
"All in all a brilliant stay!\"",,,,,
1497879,31803554,2015-05-10,28193329,Elham,We enjoyed the proximity of the studio to the Boston Logan airport.  We had an extremely early flight and the taxi ride to the airport was only $10.  The studio worked well for what we needed.  We were only there for the night before our flight.  Sara left us with a very organized binder with everything from internet instructions to local eateries and taxi phone numbers.  She gave us a tour of the studio and was very helpful.

My wife and I were in Boston for 2 days/1 night before heading to Cape Cod for the weekend. We chose to stay at Sarah's apartment in East Boston because it was a perfect location for us in terms of closeness to the airport/car rental (for out-of-town transit) and to the T (for local transit)! Sarah was extremely accommodating and accessible,and the apartment was a fine size for 2 people.,,,,
Bottom line: we would stay again!,,,,,

1497879,32452445,2015-05-18,26596565,Pam,Great location! An easy walk to the T and one stop to the airport or in the other direction many attractions only 1 or a few stops away. Worked perfectly for my agenda. I couldn't have asked for a better spot. Sara made everything simple; from key pickup to my morning cup of coffee each day.  I only issue I had was with my Verizon cell service but since I didn't spend much time in the room and  the internet worked just fine this didn't cause me any worries. I will try to stay here again the next time I am in Boston.

Sara was excellent in communicating to arrange access, and the location is on a nice quite street. It provided exactly what I was hoping for - a nice/clean place to sleep while in town for business without having to spend $350 for a hotel room."
1497879,33131666,2015-05-25,32026367,Michelle,"Sara was extremely informative. When we arrived she showed us the place and made sure we understood how all of the amenities worked. Overall, the place was tidy and homey. Thanks for everything Sara!"
1497879,33953069,2015-06-02,28478855,Adelita,It was nice. Great location! Thanks Sarah!
1497879,34295262,2015-06-07,29597672,Alicia,The apartment was clean and in a great location.  Sara was a great host!
1497879,34766091,2015-06-12,22851352,Sandra,The apartment looked like in the pictures and was fully equipped. We only stayed one night but the bed was really comfortable we slept great! The communication was perfect and fast and Sara held our bags for late check out. Perfect for our short stay
1497879,35072223,2015-06-15,28643509,Chelsie,Sara was great! We arrived later in the night due to the Red Sox game and she was able to let us in and show us around. Everything is exactly how it was advertised. Thank you again!
1497879,35249802,2015-06-16,2621548,Jill,"The studio was in the basement and it was not bad.  Limited sunlight due to it being in the basement. There was a small, worn loveseat and a small tv.  Small makeshift kitchenette area with coffee. There are somewhat steep stairs down so keep that in mind.  It was sufficient for our needs for one night."
1497879,35552479,2015-06-20,455516,Kasey,Sara is such a great hostess! She provided so many pointers for what to do in the area and how to get around. Her apartment is very close to the subway and several little gems in her neighborhood. (Italian express pizzeria...go here you won't regret it). It's also just a short walk for a fabulous view of the downtown area and the harbor! Thank you so much for your hospitality Sara!! :)
1497879,35939023,2015-06-23,21560083,Sequoia,"Sara was very accommodating to our arrival/need to leave our bags early. The room was clean and well stocked with supplies, and the bed was comfortable."
1497879,36677954,2015-06-30,32588853,Sam,"I had a great stay at Sara's place. Sara was accommodating and good with communication. She also has really detailed directions in her house manual which saved me a bit of money as I ended up using the T instead of a taxi. I've stayed in a few airbnb properties before Sara's and she was the only one to have a folder full of useful information (transport,  tourist sites,  food, etc) and it was much appreciated. I used the tourist info to fill my spare day."
"The bed is also really comfy and I slept really well. Having Netflix is also a bonus for night time.\"",,,,,
1497879,37023520,2015-07-03,37189420,Sara,"Sara was very nice and accommodating! The studio was clean and well kept, with all needed amenities."
1497879,37842258,2015-07-11,9798334,Beate,"Although I did not even meet Sarah, everything worked out perfectly. Thanks for the nice and very convenient stay!"
1497879,38593202,2015-07-17,13506008,Gulbin,"Our host was a nice person, just beware its a basement and is prone to the issues a basement can have."
1497879,38702414,2015-07-18,3826813,Laura,"I felt very welcome (Sara is a sweet host) and description of the room fit well with the place (do notice that it is a basement room). Neighborhood was nice and safe, though not a lot of restaurants or cafés. you may have a nice walk to the water side where one can watch Boston centre from a distance across the water - very nice :)"
1497879,38838229,2015-07-19,3031085,Sebastian,"I was looking for a place to stay in between a flight into Boston and a bus trip the following day. Sara's place is conveniently located, a short walk from the Maverick T station on the Blue Line."
Check-in was uncomplicated; we connected via texting. The studio itself is a basement space with little natural light. It is otherwise as described - no frills,but it did the trick for my needs.,,,,
The bed was comfortable,the couch was aging,and something in the space triggered my allergies. No idea if it was cat hair,mold,or something completely different,but my eyes were watering and my nose stuffed up. I think around 5 am
Overall,the experience was more or less what I expected and what I needed,"since I was not looking for a luxury hotel.\"",,,
1497879,39395495,2015-07-23,21042928,Victoria,"Sara was very quick to answer any of my emails or questions and although she couldn’t be there to meet us with the keys, she texted all the details in advance so we could easily get in and out. The place is located in a great neighbourhood, super close to the subway which took us right downtown. Unfortunately, although the air bnb was cute - I’m not sure if there was a flooding recently or what, but the air had a very strong smell of mold. There was an air purifier, but it didn’t feel like it did much and was just really loud throughout the night. We also couldn’t use the bedding because when we lifted the sheets, it was full of hair and chip crumbs…. so we slept on our sleeping bags on the bed….. Otherwise, Sara did stock the place with coffee, toiletries, towels and even tourist information about the city which was a very cute touch."
1497879,39625293,2015-07-25,34310612,Ruthie,"\"Our hostess, Sara made us feel welcome, and the location was nice, only one T stop to the Airport and one T stop to Long Wharf. The \"\"Welcome Book\"\" had very useful information. But we were disappointed in several factors of the space."
"\"",,,,,
1497879,39912815,2015-07-27,25765085,Sara,"Location was very convenient: quiet street, close to a beautiful park with wonderful view of downtown Boston, and close to the subway station. The room was as advertised, quite large and with all amenities (+lots of tourist info). It's in the basement, so not a lot of light, and a bit damp+ feels like a basement= the drier was on when we arrived, plus there was a recycling bin full of empty bottles, and everything wasn't perfectly clean, but still alright all in all (and you can do laundry easily, so there's that). Free street parking on the WE."
1497879,40118635,2015-07-28,36384332,Bronz,Great Studio near the airport. Great views of the city just 2-3 blocks down the road and lots of stuff to walk to. Sara has done a great job putting a binder full of helpful ideas to help you settle in.
1497879,40231237,2015-07-29,26596675,Anne,We had a pleasant time in Sara`s apartment! Anytime again.
1497879,42120920,2015-08-11,31195205,Mai,Sara was a fantastic host. Very helpful and gave us a folder of places to eat/go. Lots of travel guides for Boston and other places in the USA in the apartment which was helpful. Description was accurate. Tv had netflix. Very close to the T and the airport. Unfortunately our only complaint was that the apartment smelled like urine. We couldn't find where the smell was coming from but it was strongest around the sofa which was a bit off putting.
1497879,42306001,2015-08-12,38783532,Billy,Sara was great and very welcoming. Had everything prepared and ready for check in and her overview and booklet provided answers to any and all questions I had.
1497879,42388112,2015-08-13,24639370,Lorette,"\"Host was easy to contact, very nice and provided clear instructions/directions. Loved the welcome packet and the Keurig coffee maker. Space was cute and exactly as pictured, except there were no warning pics of the extremely narrow and deep staircase down to the apartment. I wasn't sure I was going to get my 40lb, 25\"\" spinner down and back up without falling and breaking my neck. Upon entering there was a faint odor as if a litter box needed cleaning"
1497879,42667138,2015-08-15,15698541,Joshua,"I needed an affordable place to crash for one night in Boston near the airport and Sara's basement apartment worked out well.  It's great if you don't need anything to fancy and wanna save some money, close to the T line, and very close to the airport."
1497879,43052166,2015-08-17,1177749,Jim,Sara was very responsive in making arrangements for the stay. The apartment is very convenient to the airport (one blue line stop away or a $8 taxi ride). There is plenty of room and a fan kept the place cool on a very hot day.
1497879,43483674,2015-08-20,30692226,Marion,"Sara was very easy to correspond with and made us feel very welcome. Her studio was in a perfect location, a lovely quiet area, easy to reach from the airport and a few minutes away from the waterfront where there are fantastic views of the Boston skyline. It is extremely quick and easy to reach downtown Boston on the subway. There are eating places a short walk away. We really liked the area, enjoyed our stay and would use Sara's studio again! Thank you Sara."
1497879,44104714,2015-08-24,6638642,Tiffany,"Sara was a very welcoming host and provided a tour of the space upon our arrival. This place is great if you are on a budget, but not the most comfortable during the summer since there is no AC. Like others had mentioned, there noticeable smell upon entering the apartment, probably due to the lack of ventilation in the space. A fan was provided, but it was an old fan that was so loud, that it was impossible to watch netflix and have the fan on at the same time. Additionally, the  roku to play netflix was an old system, so you can't even watch with subtitles on."
1497879,44385663,2015-08-25,18707046,Jia Ning,"Sara is a good host. At first we entered a wrong address and lost our way, she texted the correct one. The WELCOME book is very helpful and there are lots of tourist info in the room. It's in basement and the signal is not good. Plus the fridge is not very clean."
1497879,44637099,2015-08-28,33357557,Olivia,Sara was very responsive and answered any questions we had leading up to our stay. The apartment is in a nice area and close to the Maverick T station. The room was comfortable and we were provided with all necessary appliances. Would definitely recommend.
1497879,45064957,2015-08-31,12489857,Jesper,The place was nice and clean and everything worked out very well. Sara has made a nice folder with all the basic and practical information which is helpful. Quick and easy access to Boston with the T from Maverick and the best skyline views from Piers Park around the corner from the apartment.
1497879,45264512,2015-09-01,633918,Fabrizio,"Sara has been very kind to accept us in late evening and show us all the apt commodities. The apt is comfortable and in a great position for the airport, also in a walk distance for Pier Park in which enjoy an awesome skyline of Boston."
"Thanks Sara!\"",,,,,
1497879,45495244,2015-09-03,6414748,Tiffanny,Host and family are very friendly and accommodating. Exactly as described.
1497879,45990030,2015-09-07,38097423,Annie,"The host is a nice lady. But the room is in the basement and the bed is a twin size, no private parking. Need to use fans so the room is hot (no air conditioner) and noisy. We can hardly sleep during the night. The bed material is bad make it even warmer."
1497879,46166583,2015-09-08,231867,Marwan,"I didn't have the chance to see Sarah, I was communicating with her via email and sms and she was responding very quick to my questions, her mother was very welcoming despite the fact that I arrived 3 hrs late and after midnight!! Great place, includes every thing you need for either a long or short stay, I would definitely recommend this place."
1497879,46300218,2015-09-09,24173798,윤경,It was really cozy! and also her mother Susan was very nice!!
If there was air conditioner it would be better :),,,,,
"But it was good !!!\"",,,,,
1497879,46720702,2015-09-13,11703657,Pablo,"Sara was not there, but his mother help us very well she explained us very well all the house rules and we really liked that"
1497879,46893010,2015-09-14,39267093,Andrea,The apartment is something like a basement. Very hot and with a unique little window. Good position near main street.
1497879,47171957,2015-09-16,1274685,Pierre,Our stay at Sara's place was very enjoyable. We felt great staying there. The appartment is located close to downtown Boston (couple subway stops) and very close to the airport. Thanks to Sara and her Mom.
1497879,47359077,2015-09-18,8267,Erin,"This host is very organized and accommodating. She walked us through her book of things to do and went out of her way to meet us at the door even when our flight was delayed late into the night.  The room is in the basement and unfortunately, does smell a bit of cat pee. Once the window is open, it helps air flow."
1497879,47971498,2015-09-22,10193704,Mirela,"I recommend Sara's place. Very close to the T-line which can bring you basically everywhere in Boston. The place and the neighborhood are ok, we felt safe at all times."
Sara responded very quickly to our queries and she even helped us get to the airport.,,,,,
All in all,"it was a pleasant experience.\"",,,,
1497879,48077570,2015-09-23,6458686,Brian,"Had a great time at Sara's for our overnighter in Boston.  Although the place has some steep stairs in and out, the apartment is quite cozy and fully stocked.  The location is great, with markets, restaurants, and the train station just minutes away.  The neighborhood is safe and makes for a great walk, with the waterfront and spectacular views of downtown just around the corner.  Sara herself is amazing.  She was full of suggestions on what to do around Boston, including lots of free stuff only the locals know about!  We will definitely consider her place again the next time we are in Boston!"
1497879,48278322,2015-09-25,3998427,Kathleen,"\"Although never met Sara in person since we were in town only briefly overnight and our schedules did not jive,  Sara made it very easy to get in and out.  She promptly made excellent suggestions for dinner as requested.  She answered all our questions and requests thoroughly and has the most complete and helpful house manual we have ever seen in our Airbnb experience worldwide.  Her place is incredibly convenient between airport and downtown just minutes away from the \"\"T\"\""
1497879,48698096,2015-09-28,38343162,Qing,"Sara's apartment is a very cozy place when we come back after go sightseeing outside all day. There are all facilities including microwave oven, coffee machine, fridge which make our stay comfortable."
1497879,48878470,2015-09-29,38343162,Qing,"Sara's home is near the metro station, about 5-8 minutes walk. And it is safe at night.There's only a few stations you can reach downtown. Meanwhile it is near the Logan airport, this is very convenient  for us. Sara is a very kind girl, she helped me to carry my luggage downstairs into the room, and gave us a detail introduction and information. It seems she has a very cute dog :)"
1497879,49030832,2015-09-30,27758360,Joshua,"The studio apartment was perfect for our overnight stop over in Boston.  We were coming off of an international flight, and had a very early connection the next morning, and this apartment is minutes from the airport.  It saved us the worry of having to rent a car for nine hours, and from having to try and figure how to maneuver around a strange city."
Sara was very quick at returning all communication about checking in,and when we arrived at the apartment she greeted us and showed us around.  I was super impressed with what she had put together...she has everything you could need to enjoy your stay all in one binder,organized with house rules,local attractions,maps,and menus to restaurants in the area.
The studio is exactly what you see in the photos.  It is a basement apartment in an old historic building,super cute,and very different from the single story ranch houses that we have in Texas.  The stairs were steep,so watch your step when you enter,but the bed was comfortable,the shower was hot
"All in all we had a very positive experience in the studio.  \"",,,,,
1497879,49319476,2015-10-03,38739060,Franziska,"Sarah war nett und hat uns freundlich empfangen. Ebenso hat sie sich grosse Mühe gegeben, viele Infos zu sammeln und ihren Gästen einen tollen Überblick über die Gegend zu verschaffen. Leider war anhand des Inserates nicht ersichtlich, dass das Zimmer im Untergeschoss ist und über keine Fenster verfügt. Die sehr steile und enge Treppe dort hinunter fand ich beängstigend. Ebenfalls könnte man in Sachen Hygiene und Sauberkeit noch einiges verbessern."
1497879,49825735,2015-10-06,44034142,Tracy,The location was convenient to the airport and North End for our quick overnight stay in Boston.  Sara was accommodating an also had excellent communication.  The room was comfortable. We utilized the bed and also the pull out sofa.  We let Sara know of the sleeping arrangements and she had the sofa made into a bed upon arrival.  If her schedule allows she will take you to the airport for a small fee.  An excellent value in a fabulous city.
1497879,49978061,2015-10-08,36978343,Antish,Pros:
1. Well located - a few stops from downtown and attractions in Boston,,,,,
2. Sara is well prepared and the room has everything you need,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
1. Room smells of moisture very badly and we had to buy air freshner to be able to stay there,,,,,
2. There were flies in the room,i killed 3,,,,
3. The room was tidy but thrre was dust on the furniture,,,,,
"4. The shower had very low water pressure\"",,,,,
1497879,50168769,2015-10-10,34789589,Kazue,サラは忙しい中でも出来るだけの事をして、私の滞在を快適なものにしてくれました。問い合わせに対する返答ものに早く、また、テレビの不具合もすぐに対応してくれました。サラの物件は空港から1駅、ダウンタウンからも数駅で非常に交通の便が良いので短期間の滞在の方にお勧めします。
Sara is very helpful to make my stay as much as comfortable,although her busy schedule. She also responded my inquiries swiftly. When I asked about tv technical issues,she came down and fixed it.,,,
"Her place is very convenient when you come from Logan. It's also close to downtown. \"",,,,,
1497879,50746669,2015-10-14,20619654,Natasha,"Close proximity to the airport, this place was cozy. Sara was great in getting back to me quickly."
1497879,50920961,2015-10-16,26048719,Kathy,"The listing description, photos are all accurate. The studio was clean and cozy. Sara is wonderful as a host. She gave me details on how to reach the keys. A green book that has everything you need to know to get your TV, wifi, keys, groceries, getting to know Boston and etc to work (I can tell she put a lot of hard work in this!). My family had a long flight coming to Boston and they had a great stay for sure. It was wonderful how this place was close to the airport and she could even take my family to the airport the next morning due to their early flight for a great price. The neighborhood is quiet and this place is a 5-8 min walk from the Maverick station."
1497879,51117909,2015-10-18,24799376,Alex,"This apartment worked out perfectly for our short stay in Boston. Really close to the airport and the T station, which made it easy to get everywhere that we wanted to. Sara was very easy to get a hold of, and check-in/check-out was a breeze. She even gave us a ride to the airport at 4:30 in the morning! Would recommend this place highly to anyone."
1497879,51533234,2015-10-21,39485837,Richard,"Sara’s apartment was in a great location, close to both the airport and the city by metro. In fact, if you’re game, you don’t even need to catch the metro to the airport, you can just walk 15 mins to where the metro-airport shuttle bus stop is. We didn’t meet Sara, but by phone she was really friendly and responsive. She also had a book in the apartment with great suggestions for free/cheap things to do in Boston, and places to go for $1 oysters! There is a small TV with Netflix, which was good to have after a long day out in Boston."
The studio itself was nice,the pictures represent it well. My only criticism is that because it is a basement,there is a bit of a musty smell – but you get used to the smell pretty quickly,and it clears out once you let some air in,so this didn’t diminish our enjoyment of the apartment.,
Overall we had a great stay in Boston and I would definitely recommend staying here.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1497879,52211855,2015-10-27,10604919,Kepa,"Despite the good location and the attractions and facilities offered by Sara our arrival, my assessment is negative given that there is a strong urine smell of cat, in the room, impossible to remove and which makes the stay very unpleasant (reading other reviews it seems coming from far away not to take solutions)Definitely it would not repeat the stay"
1497879,52396751,2015-10-29,40233816,Lori,"Even though the location was convenient we would not stay here again. Sara was good at communicating but she was not prepared for us.  We had issues with the following: the odor was unbearable, the shower had very little pressure, tv channels did not work, the stairs need cleaning and the linens had hair on them even though they were clean."
1497879,52678827,2015-11-01,39819137,Bonnie,"My parents and I stayed at Sara's listing for 3 nights during our visit to Boston. It was nice to be away from the bustle of downtown Boston, but also be super convenient to the T and only two short stops away from attractions like Faneuil Hall, Boston Common, etc. & one stop from the airport. Sara's place is super cute and in a good area - we got back to the room late a couple of nights and never felt unsafe on the walk back from the T station. The stairs are a little steep as the room is in the basement, but as long as you pay attention that shouldn't be an issue. Also, the weather was perfect when we were there so AC wasn't necessary, but I could see the room getting warm in the summer months. Overall, we were very comfortable & would stay here again. (Never got a chance to meet Sara as I don't think our schedules jived on this trip, but she was very accommodating, allowing us to check in early since our flight landed before 2.)"
1497879,53252770,2015-11-07,9796013,Ronald & Denise,"Sara greeted me upon arrival and showed me around the studio apartment which is as pictured. Note that there are steep steps since it is a basement apartment.   She provides a Keurig, Coffee, mini fridge   and microwave also a book with restaurants and points of interest in the area.   This listing was perfect for my needs  as I was traveling alone for business and only needed a stay for 1 night.  I was leaving from Logan and this listing is very close to the airport. The shower and room were clean and I felt safe in the neighborhood walking to get dinner and would recommend this listing for a short stay.  Parking was a challenge however I was able to get a spot around the corner from the listing. The train and restaurants are within walking distance."

1497879,53675484,2015-11-11,201908,Marcus,Pros:
-Close to airport and downtown,short walk to Maverick Square and Blue Line.,,,,
-Check-in was fine,no delays or issues.,,,,
-Laundry available (if you'll be staying for awhile).,,,,,
"-DVD player with 19\"\" flat screen. She has several DVDs in the dresser below.",,,,,
-K-cup machine,kettle,tea.,,,
-Fair number of toiletries available if you need them.,,,,,
-Water for shower/washing was hot.,,,,,
-Wireless internet was reliable.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
-Basement apartment,not much light or air circulation.,,,,
-To be honest,the apartment wasn't clean. At all. It was clear to me that she basically changes the sheets on the bed and that's about it.,,,,
-Netflix worked intermittently. Because it frequently stalled,it wasn't really usable. Watching DVDs was fine,however.,,,
-Water pressure in shower was pretty weak. It's going to take you a little longer to wash all the suds off your body.,,,,,
-Bath towels were damp upon arrival.,,,,,
-Fold-out bed in loveseat was not clean,so we decided not to use it.,,,,
The greatest advantage of staying here is the location. However,the space did not feel welcoming and frankly was a little disgusting. This apartment is really best for those who need or desire to be close to both downtown and the airport and do not plan on spending much time at the apartment,using it only as a place to sleep. If you enjoy relaxing at the end of your day in your room/apartment or want to do any of your own cooking,I'd avoid this listing. Sara was thorough in her orientation and made check-in easy,but we did not see her for the rest of our stay. She also avoided making eye contact with us during check-in (perhaps just a nervous habit). This did not bother us in any way,but if you are the kind of guest who enjoys/desires interaction with your host
1497879,53795916,2015-11-12,25250152,Phil,"We only stayed for one night but the flat was well organised, Sara gave us a good introduction and we found everything we needed including coffee for the morning. The bed was comfortable and the location was great."
1497879,54116997,2015-11-16,16429513,Hailey,"Sara's apartment was in a great location (quick travel to the airport and to downtown Boston). The space looks exactly like the pictures. We had a bit of a fly problem and I wish the Internet connection was a bit better, but other than that it served its purpose."
1497879,54259358,2015-11-17,22393979,Maxim,The apartment was just like at photos. It was well equipped and Sara did everything to help me feel me welcome.
1497879,54696559,2015-11-23,4292843,Kenneth,"First 2 days had a crazy amount of bugs, but she was very nice about it and helped out. Initial room had an interesting smell, but you dont notice after a while. Checking in should be very easy!"
1497879,54889142,2015-11-25,545823,Noah,Sara was very accommodating and met me at the door. The room was exactly as expected and quite comfortable. It was also very close to mass transit which made things very easy. I would recommend Sara to anyone.
1497879,55043158,2015-11-27,35969063,Yiding,Great place to stay in ! It offers a great location as well as a very clean and tidy studio. RECOMMENDED !
1497879,55202543,2015-11-29,3616229,AnhThu,Had a great stay and everything was just as described. Sara was really helpful in answering all our questions. The best thing about the apartment is its close proximity to the subway that made getting around the city really easy.
1497879,55597838,2015-12-02,41219518,Sean,Sara was a great host and the apartment was amazing and in a good location. Would definitely stay here again!!

1497879,56095968,2015-12-08,40941541,Alex,Sara was helpful and accommodating. The room is cozy.
It is also in the basement,with a tiny window that  onto the sidewalk.,,,,
Don't open the window,no fresh air.,,,,
When I arrived,the thermostat read 76 degrees.I turned it down,and went out for dinner. Several hours later,the room was still 76 degrees. I called Sara to help me with the temperature,as the thermostat was not working. Bottom line: shut the heat off,on a Boston winter night.
Next morning,the shower was miserable. A sorry little stream of water,no pressure whatsoever. Temperature was hot,but it was a very unsatisfactory way to start the day.,,
This room could be a great situation but for those issues.,,,,,
I would not go back,"unless they were addressed.\"",,,,
1497879,56165276,2015-12-09,4810537,Sean,"Great layout and exactly what I was looking for. Sara was communicated very well and the apartment while small, has everything a passing through traveler would need. I was worried about transportation, but many Uber cars are around even at 5:00am."
1497879,56239381,2015-12-11,44796408,Temeka,Had a great time at Sara's - it's such a convenient location to the airport! Thanks so much!!
1497879,56642563,2015-12-15,3660628,Michelle,"I stayed at Sara's place for one night on a business trip. The location was great, I was looking for something convenient from South Station. I had a rental and there was plenty of overnight street parking. Her basement studio is super cute, bathroom is fully stocked, and there is even a little fridge/microwave/coffee pot area similar to what you get in a hotel."
Key pick up was easy,communication was great. She is very thorough,there was even an extensive guide book that she put together with all the info you could ever need.,,,
Be prepared to carry your luggage down a flight of narrow,steep stairs. My bag was not big,so it was no big deal for me,"but if you had huge suitcases it would be a bit of a struggle. \"",,
1497879,56711365,2015-12-16,16297879,Nero,Sara's place was amazing!!! It's a very peaceful and serene setting. Very quiet street.. Cozy house.... And and very comfortable bed!!!
1497879,56857344,2015-12-19,9564750,Eileen,"Sara is a great and friendly host. I stayed at her place with my boyfriend for three nights, and she was wiiling to help and answer every quesion. Her place is very close to the T station, the airport and downtown location. The green booklet in the room with all the information is excellently helpful. The room itself is cozy. Strongly recommend!:)"
1497879,56968364,2015-12-20,13637574,Martin,Sara and the apartment were both incredible; checking in and out couldn't have been easier and the apartment was very cozy.   Would absolutely stay here again when back in Boston.
1497879,57084672,2015-12-21,6672828,Meghan,"Sara was always readily available and answered all questions promptly. The place was just as it appears on the site, clean and organized. It is an easy 5-6 minute walk to the train station and has very easy access to downtown. The only downside was there seemed to be an open vent somewhere so it was a tad cold and there seemed to be a fly or two that snuck in somehow. Other than that, it was a great stay. The coffee was a HUGE help!!!"
1497879,57191984,2015-12-22,41722092,Matthias,Sara was very kind and welcoming and moving in was uncomplicated. The room is nice and the location is conveniently located close to the airport.
1497879,57239632,2015-12-23,42708536,Wolarpol,Sara was very nice and welcoming. She was very caring to show me everything I needed to know for the studio.
1497879,57357812,2015-12-24,45498515,Kanishk,Sara was a very friendly host. She checked us in with great detail in spite of her busy schedule. Her check-in folder was by far the most comprehensive AirBnB folder I've seen and we didn't have questions that weren't already answered. She was very responsive and helped us feel at home!
"Thank you Sara... You are awesome! \"",,,,,
1497879,57593733,2015-12-27,49834575,Chaofan,"The room is great with everything you need! And very convenient to public transportation and airport. Also, the instruction book was very impressive with all the detail. Great experience, thanks!"
1497879,58967006,2016-01-05,49446728,Billy,Nice host. Apartment is in a very convenient location. Water pressure is very low making showers difficult.
1497879,59215269,2016-01-08,49904711,Qingya,Sara's mother welcomed us that day since Sara is out of town. She is very considerate and make sure everything ok for us. The room is clean and comfortable.
1497879,59592726,2016-01-12,14078102,Anderson,"Sara's apartment was nothing short of nice - we did not get to meet Sara, but Susan (her mom) was a great host. She made every effort to make us feel welcome, and we got to even meet her pet Yorkie and Garfield!"
The room is true to its' depiction- of course,the steep flight of stairs down was initially a little daunting for us,since we had a quite a bit of luggage to carry,but once we got it in,it was just perfect.,
I'd like to thank Susan for being a wonderful host - sharing with us stories about her kids (she's proud mom of three :) ),and life in Michigan,in the peaceful rural hinterlands.,,,
"And thank you for the lift to the airport - we can't begin to express how grateful we were for that - you left a wonderful start to our journey in America :)\"",,,,,
1497879,60590879,2016-01-25,33206172,Claudia,"I did not meet Sara but her mom who welcomed me. I had a great stay, everything was just as described. The location is also great, very close to the train station- one stop away from the airport and two to three stations away from the city center- depending on where you exactly want to go. The instruction book with a listing of all the sightseeing and the relevant train station I also found very helpful!"
All in all,"everything was very well-organized and I can really recommend anybody to stay in Sara's studio!\"",,,,
1497879,60774743,2016-01-27,38268192,Mélanie,"We needed a simple studio close to the airport and Sara's place was perfect. It is cozy and cute, the bed is very comfortable. It is not far from the Center and very convenient. Sara's mom welcomed us and was very nice. I would definitely recommend this studio."
1497879,60863046,2016-01-28,23270777,Lee,The place is very close to the airport and also very easy to go to the (URL HIDDEN)'s mom Susan is very nice and considerate for s.Thanks a lot!
1497879,61047300,2016-01-31,36964596,Michelle,The apartment was exactly how described and perfect for our stay. It was in a great location very close to the T stop. We were able to leave our bags early since we got in earlier than our check in time without any problem. I would definitely recommend.
1497879,61213955,2016-02-01,16591389,Michael,"My wife and sister were traveling with me back to the United States from Portugal going through Boston. The host was incredibly well prepared; there was a comprehensive binder highlighting transportation, dining and anything else we might need.  The host was great company and treated us with respect. We would happily book again next time we're in Boston."
1497879,61373113,2016-02-03,29798301,Sharon,"Sara is a friendly and organized person, and her studio is also very nice and clean. I have a great night staying there."
"highly recommend it!!\"",,,,,
1497879,61444931,2016-02-04,17959626,Philip,"Sara's apartment is wonderful - easy to find, very accessible to downtown and quite close to the airport too. As a hostess you couldn't ask for better - great information about the local area and very accommodating in terms of arrival and departure."
"The room/apartment has everything and is in a nice quiet neighbourhood. I really hope I have a chance to go back again sometime and spend even longer there. \"",,,,,
1497879,61641831,2016-02-07,30416967,Kris,"My girlfriend and I LOVED staying at Sara's apartment for our first visit to Boston. Location was more than ideal (and picturesque) as it was only a few minutes away from both airport and downtown Boston by subway. She was incredibly helpful and accommodating before and during our trip. We will definitely be looking at staying here again on our next excursion to Boston! THANK YOU, SARA!"
1497879,62908416,2016-02-18,55337022,Jenny,Sara was very accommodating. We arrived late and it was no issue and she was very thorough in helping us get in.  The place was exactly what we needed. Nothing fancy just a place to sleep after a long day of traveling.
The bed was very comfortable and the place was warm. We didn't use the shower/bathroom,tv,or any amenities so I cannot review. Overall a great place and host. I would stay again,"its a perfect location next to the airport and T. \"",,
1497879,63548437,2016-02-24,12210099,Kristen,Thanks for a great stay Sara!  My sister and I had a perfectly good stay here for our night out in Boston.  Apartment was a little further from the TD Garden than I originally thought (a $10-15 Uber ride) but it was fine for our one night!
"\"",,,,,
1497879,63794074,2016-02-27,10086267,Michael,"I stayed at Sara's place for a residency interview at MGH. Getting to and from both the airport and the hospital was quick and simple, and Sara provided easy-to-follow directions. The apartment is small but clean and perfectly matches her description. Sara was a very attentive host and provided plenty of info regarding local places to eat, landmarks, etc."
1497879,63995282,2016-02-28,56108333,Matthew,"Staying at Sara's was a great experience, my friends and I needed an affordable place to stay for the night and this was perfect. It felt very comfortable and we felt right at home. Would absolutely recommend to anyone!"
1497879,64124564,2016-02-29,39073382,Kelly,The space was great and very easy to get in and out of! Sara was easy to communicate with as well. Thanks for the binder of info--so helpful!
1497879,64276055,2016-03-01,19186475,Amber,"Sara was very flexible, accommodating with our check-in time, and communicative. Exactly as described. Was grateful for the coffee machine :) Located in East Boston, it was a 10 minute drive to the touristy locations (Freedom Trail, etc.) I was able to find street parking before 5pm and we could park for free overnight."
1497879,64309132,2016-03-02,57630057,Vicky,"The appartment is really cozy and warm. It's really well isolated from souand and light. It's easy to walk from the airport to the appartement.  Just be careful, the park when you get out the shuttle is close so you need to walk by the street."
I saw some weird people in the streets getting there,but it was midnight. When we leave the appartment in the morning,"they was really more nice looking people in the streets ! \"",,,
1497879,64512323,2016-03-05,10729703,Dave,"Sara was a great host - could not have been more flexible. We were only in Boston for 36 hours and Sara's apartment was ideal - close to the airport, close to a T system station and local shops."
The apartment was very cosy with a comfortable bed. We appreciated the good internet connection and the Netflix TV service. Having a coffee maker and supplies of coffee was great.,,,,,
"We would love to stay again during a future visit to Boston !\"",,,,,
1497879,64611803,2016-03-06,51358148,Pam,Sara was very friendly. The space is cute and was good for the one night we needed it.
1497879,64830902,2016-03-08,57459981,Wendy,"The cab drivers didnt know how to get there, but it was very close to the airport ans convienent. Sara was very nice and everything in the description was accurate."

It was our first experience with AirBnB and we really enjoyed it,she went as far as providing coffee,disposable utensils,a small but very nice DVD collection,lots of brochures about local atractions and take out fliers.,
"If (when) going back to Boston we're definitely looking to stay there again.\"",,,,,
1497879,66182938,2016-03-20,4744261,Vatana,"Had a nice stay! Was only in town for 1.5 days so this was perfect. The apt is accurately depicted in the post, which is important to me."
1497879,66362088,2016-03-22,50136332,Seth,"Everything was great - Host was able to get us checked in late and the bed was very comfortable - Had a washer/dryer, fridge, coffee maker and great internet. All that was so nice and it's close to a Metro Line - Best deal in town!!!"
1497879,68326357,2016-04-04,6959677,Hannah,"We had a nice, convenient stay at Sara's apartment. She was easy to communicate with, and was accommodating with our arrival time. Location is great, within two blocks of the T and a nice view of the river and the city!"
1497879,68365928,2016-04-04,34767156,Michael,"We were warmly greeted by Sara and then shown around the hosts guest area. Sara explained everything and also directed us to the folder she had prepared for guests ( this lists in a clear way everything you need to know). The place was ideal for us , positioned on the east side of the City with easy access to Logan Airport and the MBTA. We had a comfortable stay."
1497879,68882502,2016-04-07,33933097,Tom,"This is a great apartment. It was clean and spacious, and Sara was very welcoming and helpful. We also appreciated the coffee machine and small fridge."
We didn't get to check out much of the neighbourhood but it seemed quiet. We walked from Logan airport - probably about a 30 minute walk and would have been difficult without GPS,"but doable if you want to save a little on a cab.\"",,,,
1497879,69636399,2016-04-12,13453651,João,"A estada no apartamento da Sara foi excelente. Acomodação confortável, limpa, organizada e a poucos metros do metrô."
1497879,69802350,2016-04-13,4144226,Lauren,Easy to get into the location great place for the price. It was super easy to get into and out of. We were going straight from the airport and back the next morning and it made the commute very easy. If you are allergic to cats this is not the best apartment for you since my friend who has mild allergies needed to take medicine.
1497879,69860793,2016-04-14,15028719,Lauren,"Sara was a great host and very easy to communicate with. The apartment was the perfect size, value and location for our overnight stay in Boston. I would definitely recommend staying here."
1497879,71304025,2016-04-24,30486651,Patrick,"We had a lovely time in Boston, thanks in part to Sara and her very accommodating place. The bed was comfortable, and there were numerous accommodations to make the day-to-day easier, including coffee! Sara's instructions for getting into the place were great, making it easy to come and go as we pleased."
1497879,71540909,2016-04-26,34759008,Mike,Cozy little place to stay. We used an Uber to get back and forth to downtown. Quick and convenient. Check-in and out instructions were simple.
1497879,71682934,2016-04-27,6755866,Rajiv,"We didn't get to meet Sara in person, and had unique circumstances, in that we arrived late in the evening, and had to leave again at 330 am for a flight, but her place functioned perfectly as a 'crash pad' for the night, allowing us to get a little rest, and shower, before a further 20 hrs of flight. Be advised that the stairs down are extremely steep - fine for normal use, but may be difficult if you're wrangling substantial luggage, children, or if you have limited mobility. I appreciated that Sara was prompt in responding to a text regarding a question I had while we were there, and there's a really cute little Italian place in easy walking distance which was featured in DDD. We enjoyed our stay, and if ever we found ourselves needing to stay in that part of Boston again, wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."
1497879,72307248,2016-05-01,14262095,Adi,Fabulous place to stay in Boston! Love the location!
1497879,73534157,2016-05-08,50413141,Huayi,Sara is nice and friendly. She guided me through the apartment when I arrived and gave me a folder with a lot of useful information. She also helped me to print out my boarding pass before I check out. The apartment is of walking distance to the T and easy to find. Perfect place to stay for overnight!
Sara非常友好,会热情介绍房间的情况。她有一个册子,"里面包含房间和附近交通景点餐饮等的信息。房子离地铁很近而且很容易找到。\"",,,
1497879,74571056,2016-05-15,10214852,Amy,"Sara was super helpful and suuuuper sweet! She was very accommodating with having to drop off luggage early and such! Her place was very cozy and comfortable as well! Thanks so much, Sara!"
1497879,74940858,2016-05-17,14262095,Adi,Our second stay. This time for just a quick eight hour sleep! Sara's place is just a 10 min taxi ride to the airport! Perfect stopover!
1497879,75220378,2016-05-19,21504794,Terri,"Sara made us feel welcome be allowing us to put our bags in the room even though it was not cleaned from the previous guests, it was very helpful.  Also she has a book that she made of things to do in Boston, from free to spendy, that was helpful.  The neighborhood was run down, but very convenient to the subway and two blocks from a beautiful park on the ccean, that had a great view of the Boston skyline. Also a little corner market about a block a way for fruit, etc."
1497879,75410747,2016-05-21,50473673,Bryan,"Sara was a great host, very flexible with arrival and departure and the apartment was nice and exactly as described."
1497879,76100990,2016-05-24,7039087,Kirill,"We had only one day and a half of night in Sara's place before our departure from Logan airport. The apartment has all you may need. Coffee machine with coffee for guests, detailed information about Boston, comfortable beds. The stairs down is rather steep, in case if you have large baggage. Nevertheless, it is good place for its location and price."
1497879,76198247,2016-05-25,16775212,Caroline,Perfect location for arriving at the airport and exploring the city during the day. All needed amenities were there and the stay was comfortable. Would stay again!
1497879,76302891,2016-05-26,17206723,Devan,"Sara was great. We had a red eye and landed in Boston at 6:30am, and she was able to take our bags at 8am so we could explore the city. We also had a late flight on our departure, so she held our bags until we were ready to leave. She was gracious and we enjoyed staying with her."
1497879,77245737,2016-05-30,28315359,Christina,Great location to both the airport and downtown via the T. Perfect for our short stay in Boston for a music fest downtown.
1497879,77541277,2016-06-01,6357314,Evan,Communication and access was very easy and efficient.
The apartment was just what we needed and Sara was very helpful even suggesting places to park overnight.,,,,,

"Sarah was most helpful and met us when we arrived and the room was pleasant enough for our short stay.\"",,,,,
1497879,78113186,2016-06-05,41142333,Verity,"PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BOOKING ANY AIR BNB ACCOMMODATION! DON'T go off the star rating and just read the first couple of pages of the reviews. Sarah's place was one of the first airBnB accommodations we had booked for our USA travel trip . Sarah was very lovely but unfortunately her place was not and it definitely wasn't up to airBNB standards based on the other accommodation we have now stayed at (some places were cheaper and at a 5 star level) There is a constant smell that I can only describe as cat urine or a dirty cat litter tray... and one window with a note asking you not to open it.. Thinking I dropped something, I glanced under the bed to discover a pile of dust which explained our allergies playing up...there was also an incredible amount of dust on the fan provided. It is very close to public transport which will get you everywhere you need to go easily and is only a short trip from the airport. Sarah has a file of great places to visit in Boston, has a washer and dryer which was also very convenient. If the above wouldn't bother you then I say book this accommodation...otherwise please look else where because the price she charges is not worth it. I hope Sara reads this and rectifies the issues I've posted because it ruined an otherwise perfect air BnB."
1497879,78701435,2016-06-08,56751445,Andreas,"Unfortunately we didn't meet Sara but the communication was excellent. The apartment is located in the basement. The bed is very comfortable, there is everthing provided (towels, tv, a fan, shampoo, shower gel, coffee machine, microwave, kettle, toaster, etc - everthing you need :-) )."
There are many restaurants,grocery stores and bars in the neighborhood and you are only one stop from the airport with the T  and two stops from downtown.,,,,
Actually we would rate 5 stars or even more because the apartment is really lovely and Sara was a great host. But there was a strong smell of cat pee or something like this... and this ruind the great experience a bit.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1497879,78881235,2016-06-09,37798694,Jenny,Great little studio close to the airport and just a couple blocks from the subway.  Sara was very welcoming and had an organized book of places to eat and things to see.  I definitely recommend a stay here!

The place was clean, bed was comfortable and it all looked just like the pictures.  Sara was very kind,  and answered all of my questions. I had a great stay!  Can definitely recommend her!"

1497879,80007708,2016-06-15,61403005,Nicholas,Great stay.
1497879,80248802,2016-06-17,16240583,Trey,Everything was as advertised.  Very easy to work with.  My only issue was the lack of available street parking.  I did receive a ticket despite moving my car before the 8:00am time stated.
1497879,80506445,2016-06-18,11050498,Sang,"Once we arrived to the studio, Sara immediately greeted us and kindly assisted us with our baggage. I love how organised she is! She has a binder of FAQs  which was really useful. My favourite part of the studio is the fact that the subway station is literally a 3 mins walk away. The area is also safe which made us feel comfortable."
"Thank-you Sara for the hospitality. \"",,,,,
1497879,81410189,2016-06-22,51766938,Ethan,"Sara is a great host, very friendly. Walked me through the apartment upon arrival and made sure I had everything I needed. She was very organized-everything I needed to know (WiFi, nearby restaurants, how to work Netflix/Roku, etc) was contained in a binder she had on the table. I only stayed for one night, so didn't get a chance to use it, but her listing of fun things to do around the city was a nice touch."
1497879,81506289,2016-06-23,44702861,Michelle,Excellent location with plenty of private space.  Sara is super organized and had a folder of helpful information about her place and the surrounding area.  Would definitely stay here again.
1497879,82671503,2016-06-28,11624242,Joanna,"Sara was really helpful re my arrival & also letting me leave my luggage til early afternoon as it meant I could do more tourist visits on my last morning. Access to the Subway was great - close, & quick into the City. The main entrance is not very nice, and once inside the building, the studio is down some narrow steep stairs which could be difficult for big cases or anyone a bit unsteady on their feet. As it's a basement it's dark. It was a hot spell during my visit & the air conditioner was helpful"
1497879,83037694,2016-06-30,66449285,Ryan,"Sara's place was great for a 2 night stay. It's in East Boston so it's near the airport and only a few minutes from a T station. Everything was exactly as advertised. We really appreciated how thoughtful Sara is - from the helpful binder of FAQs to the signage she posts throughout the apartment - she put a lot of thought and time into making your stay as easy and comfortable as possible. She's also very quick to respond to inquiries and is very accommodating. The only negative that prevents me from giving 5 stars overall was the smell of cat pee that I suspect was coming from the couch. It's possible that a cat peed on the couch some time ago but the smell often returns in the hot and humid summer months in my experience. This may be particularly off-putting to some guests. Otherwise, Sara's apartment is everything you'd want for a great AirBnB experience."
1497879,83964297,2016-07-04,61434345,Vanessa,"\"The apartment is very close to an mbta station, which makes it easy to reach downtown Boston quickly. The apartment itself is clean and equipped with everything you might need. It is below ground and has only a very small window that cannot be opened. As other visitors already commented, there is an unpleasant odor that was present during our entire stay. In case you're looking for the \"\"airbnb experience\"\" in the sense of interaction with the host"
1497879,84484830,2016-07-07,64718583,Wendy,"Sara was very helpful with information.  We did find the apartment very warm, although there is an air con unit.  It is a basement apartment and weather very hot on our stay.  very comfortable bed and fluffy white towels."
1497879,84673546,2016-07-08,23051304,Christine,Sara was a great host. She was great with communication and was easy to work with. The place was in a convenient location. Everything was as pictured. The house did have a strong litter box smell.
1497879,84991408,2016-07-10,51248224,Gili,"Unfortunately, I was far from being satisfied with my stay at Sara’s place, below is a detailed explanation why I feel that way."
I arrived at Boston for a one-night stay after a transatlantic flight on my way to another destination. Although I came early in the morning (9:00am) Sara allowed me to check-in and made things easy. Sadly,"in a later correspondence with her I found out that  “gesture” won't be possible anymore because (quoting from our email correspondence): \"\"In the future I am going to make my 2pm check-in time firm",and won't allow early bag drop-off,"as it has become too much of an inconvenience to cater to the needs of every traveler's individual schedule\"\".",,
All through the night I heard loud noises from the ceiling above me (be aware that the unit is simply her basement floor),of what seemed to be animals running back and forth. The fact that the noises might have been rates,made my sleeping uncomfortable. Retrospectively,I understood that a dog and a cat were the cause for the noises during the night – a fact that was not mentioned in her original airbnb posting.  For those of who consider rent this place – take into consideration the fact that this apartment is a basement above which two very active pets live. If you are allergic to animals,or if you simply don’t want to hear animals running on the floor above you,simply know that it’s a risk you’re gonna take if you’ll stay there.
"The description of the apartment is misleading: \"\"enjoy beautiful skyline views from across the harbor\"\". That is simply far from being true. That view is probably possible from the roof of the building",not from the windowless basement!,,,,
Lastly,alas the least disappointing of all,is the fact that the pathway with the stairs leading to the basement were very narrow which made it very difficult to transfer my luggage through.,,,
Given the above,it is obvious that if I would have known it’ll be such a disaster,I would have paid more and stated somewhere else.,,,
After my visit,I email Sara expressing my concerns about the noises; her reply was rude and inconsiderate. To my surprise,instead of showing solidary and understanding,her response culminated in “most city apartments have pets” and “maybe next time you should just go to an hotel”. This is not what I would expect from ANY host.,,
All in all,if you still reading that feedback,here is what you need to take from it -if you’re interested in a windowless basement unit with a super narrow staircase,with pets running above your head,and with a host that does not care about your feedback – this is your place!!,

1497879,85373732,2016-07-11,27065954,Nicholas,"Sara's place was nice for a one day stopover in Boston. It is a small basement apartment, but served our needs for a night. It is well furnished and stocked to make you feel at home. We didn't meet Sarah, but she was very quick to respond to our questions and coordinating our check in. The location between the airport and the city is convenient, and public transit is just a few blocks away for easy access. We loved the neighborhood. It is quiet but lively, and a pleasant escape from the city."
1497879,85551441,2016-07-12,2341179,Laura,"I wouldn't recommend this place in its current state. My family and I had to leave and check into a nearby hotel at 9:30 PM because we couldn't stay here. The main bed broke when my mum sat on it, and the smell of cat urine was overwhelming."
If the bed wasn't on its side and the place didn't smell like a cat's litter tray,this place would actually be perfect for the airport. The location is great,Sara was very helpful on arrival,the bathroom was perfectly adequate and the tea/coffee making facilities were great. Unfortunately,there was nowhere to sleep and the smell made a few of us quite ill. It's also a lot more claustrophobic than I was expecting.,
We got a huge room at nearby hotel for a similar price to Sara's listing. This included breakfast,free shuttle service and a secure place to leave your bags after a generous checkout time – much better value for money. I normally love Airbnb,"but this time it let me down. I regret not looking at the reviews more carefully as someone has raised the issue of the cat urine smell before. \"",,,
1497879,86097709,2016-07-14,53428069,Andrew,EXCELLENT location! Short walk to park overlooking Boston. Beautiful spot to watch sun set over the city. Neighbor hood felt safe and we walked to local restaurants. Very short uber ride into the city.  Sarah was very nice. Gave some good tips.  Let us know she was available for any arising issues. The place did have a pee smell though.
1497879,86485445,2016-07-16,45465067,Chavonne,Great place to stay for a nice easy commute into the city!
1497879,87555308,2016-07-20,52931043,Jannis,"We only stayed one night at Sara's Studio, but were more than satisfied."
The place was absolutely clean and tidy,Sara was there to welcome us and the check-in worked perfectly. Furthermore,Sara provides a little book with instructions on how to use the interior,and also tips for what to do in Boston as well as a set of gorcery stores and restaurants in the area. We find that every host on airbnb should provide one like Sara does,and were very positively suprised.,
The Apartment is short walking distance to a blue Line station which makes getting into town and back to the studio very easy. The neighbourhood was safe,supermarkets and restaurants were also in,,,,
walking distance.,,,,,
Overall,"we would stay at Sara's studio again and would recommend to anyone on vacation in Boston.\"",,,,
1497879,88490003,2016-07-24,4031089,Mélodie,"L'appartement est conforme à la description et est très bien situé. 5 minutes à pied du métro, 3 stations pour rejoindre downtown et tout proche de l'aéroport pour ceux qui arrivent ou repartent en avion. Il est très bien équipé et Sara est disponible. Elle répond rapidement aux questions, et nous a chaleureusement accueilli. Un très bon plan sur Boston, ville si chère en qualité de logement !"
1497879,89182279,2016-07-27,74414381,Bitu,"Perfect location, only 5 minutes from the airport. Quiet neighborhood but not far from downtown. I would stay again at Sara's place!"
1497879,89793261,2016-07-30,6357659,Kathy,Waited up for my arrival -  since my plane was delayed and I didn't get in until the wee hours of the morning. Great crash pad near the airport.  I was able to walk to the to airport car rental facility the following day - saving me a night's rental.
1497879,90636429,2016-08-01,13606131,Michael,"Sara's place is one stop away from the airport, while being very close to the sites of Boston as well. Location wise it's excellent. Sara was there to greet me and was very friendly and provided a full run down on the apartment which answered any questions I might have come up with. Very comprehensive from attractions to restaurants that deliver. It is a small space. You could do three people but it would be a tight fit. It's better suited for 1-2. There's not a lot of natural light since it's basement level. If you need that be aware. The neighborhood is mostly residential so it's nice and quiet. I wouldn't bother with a car. Parking is tight, and outside of East Boston, navigating the rest of the city is an adventure at best."
1497879,91696846,2016-08-06,83200002,Karen,"Sara lives in a great location! The biggest drawback was the staircase, which we were warned about. It definitely was a challenge getting the bags up and down the steep flight. As others have mentioned, there is a litter box smell, though no litter box is in sight. It was nice to have the washer and dryer available, even though we didn't use it. Plenty of room for two people, though. And everything was well stocked -- bathroom amenities and extra blankets were available. Plus Sara had a binder put together with lots of helpful city info. Easy trip to the airport, too."
1497879,95378772,2016-08-19,82104240,Peter,"Room was as listed, nice location in terms of being able close to the airport and city centre.  I didn't get to meet Sara due to clashes with her work schedule, but she was helpful with queries via email."
1497879,95774380,2016-08-20,48653824,Marcel,Everything was as advertised on AirBnB. Sara´s place was just perfect for us as we had just one night in Boston. Everything was  nice and clean and communication with Sara worked perfectly. Perfect location if you want to be close to the airport. We would stay again with Sara!
8930592,51104042,2015-10-17,23495332,Robin,"Perfect spot for us to spend the night before flying out of Logan.  It's close to all Boston has to offer and spacious enough for my husband, so and me as well as my parents and the in-laws.  Dan was a great host; answered all  our questions and made our stay more than we'd hoped for."
8930592,51419566,2015-10-19,20335445,Renee,"We were in town and got lucky booking this place last minute, but so glad we did! I was worried about not having a car but the convenient location made things a breeze!"
Besides easy access to the seaport,our beds were comfy,the place was spotless,"and Dan responded quickly to my inquiries. Thanks and would def stay again!\"",,
8930592,52440778,2015-10-29,2919938,Kristel,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Dan's apartment. It's in a very convenient part of South Boston, within a short walking distance to public transportation, a grocery store, good restaurants and pubs, as well as a few cute, local shops. The furnishings are comfortable; after long days of both work and sightseeing, we enjoyed relaxing in the living room to something on Netflix before falling asleep in the very comfortable new beds."
The apartment is newly renovated,and we ran into an issue with a leak in the kitchen sink. However,Dan and his property manager were very easy to get a hold of and worked to fix the problem. It really did not affect our stay at all.,,,
Dan was also great recommending places to eat,shop,and visit. I was in town for work,and my mom and sister came to experience Boston for the first time. Not only did they feel safe on their own in the neighborhood,they loved all of Dan's recommendations.,
I don't know when we'll be back in the area,"but we'd definitely want to stay here again. \"",,,,

8930592,53225869,2015-11-06,26506338,Pk,"The home was exactly as described and as depicted in the listing photos.  The property is clean, the beds are comfortable, the furnishings are nice, and the home was equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  The property is perfect for a family or a large group traveling in the area.  As noted in the listing, parking is extremely difficult, so I would explore the recommended app.  We experienced a hiccup in the check-in process, but the remainder of our stay was smooth.  Overall, I would recommend this property to guests searching for a comfortable stay in Boston."
8930592,53389403,2015-11-08,47350382,Du,"Helpful and friendly host, good place for family trip. Parking is hard to find around the house, just don't drive or reserve you parking spot before you arrive!"

8930592,59414934,2016-01-10,52590973,Dan,Dan did an extremely good job with the listing and helping us with places to go. The neighborhood was quiet but we were able to play music and did not get any noise complaints or anything. The beds were comfy and the futon was more comfortable than expected. We really enjoyed out stay.
8930592,60073653,2016-01-18,53970034,Erich,Dan and Anya were unbelievable hosts from their willingness to accommodate to our needs all the way to having the apartment stocked with all the necessities.

8930592,63757572,2016-02-26,4179466,Tobin,"Dan's place is exactly why I love Airbnb. My brother and our two small kids needed a place to stay for a night in Boston. Having a clean, convenient place with all of the comforts of home made it so much easier than a hotel. Even in the short amount of time we spent there, we got the taste of south Boston and Dan's hospitality. Super convenient to the airport. I'd highly recommend it!"

It was cozy, very clean, and relatively close to the Boston Convention centre (about 20 minutes walking distance). It's in a residential area that we had never been to in Boston, so it was very convenient."

The distance and connection to the city center and the convention center was fine. For the five of us, the appartment was spaceous enough, the beds were all fine although replacement of the matras of the fold out bed in the livingroom seems to be due soon. The livingroom was too dark (lights didnt all seem to work) and it was quite hard to cook in the appartment since only very old cooking pans were available. Dan was a great host and all his recommendations were good!"

8930592,71522717,2016-04-25,51662519,Angela,"The listing and neighborhood was just as described: quiet and quaint. The place itself is nice and somewhat spacious, but not for 8 people. Yes, it CAN accommodate 8, but it definitely shouldn't. The bathroom rotations were more ridiculous than we had expected. There also seemed to be a problem with the drainage of the bathroom sink; turning the faucet on for a minute would almost have the sink overflowing. The majority of my group also felt that it was too dusty; sitting on a bed easily got lint all over our dark clothes. Everyone's allergies were also suddenly acting up due to the dusty feel when we first checked-in. The kitchen was nice but the table was not made for 8. My whole party could not eat together comfortable and we had to take turns at the dining table along with the bathroom. Anya was very friendly helpful. It was easy to reach her whenever a minor issue arose. Otherwise, it was a nice stay overall and I would recommend this to friends-who have a smaller party :)"

We ended up taking Lyfts most of the time because we had 7 of us, but it was usually less than $9 (each car) to get where we wanted to go."
The space was just as described,and great for our needs. It was up a steep flight if stairs,which was ok,but I wish I had known sine we were traveling with my 75 year old mother.,,
My only complaint was that the dishes were a bit dirty when we arrived. Dan let us come before the official check in time,so they may not have had enough time to get everything cleaned.,,,,

As our first experience, it was a great and clean place to stay.  On a last minute trip with colleagues for a convention and all the hotels were booked -- there was plenty of space for three adults.  We wish we could have enjoyed our stay longer!"
Dan is very timely and responsive - he also had a great list of area places of interests and eats and true to explain the issues with parking if you drive.   I would book with him again the next time I'm in Boston for business or a family getaway.,,,,,

8930592,82204051,2016-06-26,12987877,Will,"\"Really nice place - clean, light, accurately described in the listing.  Dan was always quick to respond. We all really liked the neighborhood.  It's about 8 blocks from the waterfront, which has a great path along it. And there are plenty of nice shops and restaurants close by. Relatively easy to get to from the airport.  The T stop (Boston's subway) is more than a mile away but there is a bus line that is really close.  There is also a Hubway station (the Boston bike share system) at the public library right around the corner so you can easily get a bike to ride around the area for $6. The listing said it was a very quiet neighborhood.  On Saturday night, one of the neighbors was playing music really loudly until around midnight.  It didn't bother us at all because we were up and hanging out on the patio (which is also really nice), but I'm not sure if the \"\"very quiet neighborhood\"\" description is entirely accurate.  At least not on that one particular night.\""
8930592,82698740,2016-06-28,2966106,Paige & David,This was a quiet oasis in busy Boston. Dan's apartment is well furnished with three private bedrooms. The memory foam beds were comfortable and the window unit air conditioners kept us cool while we slept.
We found the transit easy to get to downtown,taking the bus to the T station. Because our visit included Sunday,we were even able to find free parking on the street near the apartment for our car during our stay.,,,
We enjoyed drinking coffee on the back deck in morning.  The kitchen enabled us to make breakfasts at home in the morning before heading off for our day.,,,,,
The wifi was quick and much appreciated as we had a little work to do remotely before site seeing each day.,,,,,
Dan left clear instructions and was easy to communicate with during our stay.,,,,,

Orchid is definitely a great host. I despite staying there for roughly 3 days, I never came across the mouse that was alluded to in other reviews.

4924009,28826784,2015-03-30,28815032,Romina,"Regular. El departamento estaba sin terminar. Huecos en la pared con cables que salian. La television no andaba, lo reclame y nunca lo soluciono.

Eddie , Ahmed's assistant , is very friendly and did everything possible to make check in early . The appartment is well equipped for two and the bed is comfortable ."
Regarding the negatives: was poorly finished,quite dirty and dusty. Also had holes in the walls,and lights and outlets that did not work .,,,
As regards the building is very old and we needed to climb stairs to get there. It is particularly dirty and unkempt. It has central heating,"so inside the department was warm sometimes and in several opportunities we had cold.\"",,,,
4924009,31795802,2015-05-10,30408250,Ashley,"An associate Eddie, met us at the apartment in good time after our arrival and showed us around our accommodations. The apartment was quaint as we new it would be however must be under construction as there were several holes in the walls (not shown in photos). Another thing we noticed as we were attempting to get ready the next day was that only two out of the several outlets were in working order."
On the bright side the location in the city could not have been any better. We were within walking distance to Boston Common and the Public Gardens as well as the T station located in Boston Common. There was also a Starbucks on the block which was great! We were within walking distance to several amazing places to eat,"the Prudential building as well as Newberry street for shopping. Although we were located right in the heart of the Theatre District which was hopping it was fairly quiet in the apartment. If you are looking for an authentic Boston experience I would definitely recommend staying here!\"",,,,
4924009,32191010,2015-05-15,17898817,Leonid,"The location is great for sight-seeing, it's close to downtown and many historical sights. The building looks run down but the apartment itself has been renovated. It is nothing special but everything works. Wi-fi access was fast. Downsides: the restroom was quite small, the toilet seat was too close to the wall to the point it's uncomfortable, the exhaust fan was very loud."
4924009,33069226,2015-05-25,15029089,Priscilla,This apartment is very well located and Eddy are really friendly .
Previous reviews were right when the finishing poorly made and cleanliness average . The bathroom should be renovated and the big holes left by the electrical work make the dubious apartment. Water was also cast light on the bathroom one morning. After a call to Eddy,a man came quickly .,,,,

4924009,33505675,2015-05-29,30282678,Chris,Communication with host was good. It should be noted he is not the owner. It was downhill from there...
Apartment was terrible especially for the price they are asking. Entrance to building was filthy and there was construction debris scattered everywhere. Garbage in the hallway outside the apartment. Inside the apartment was a slight (and I mean slight) improvement. Bathroom was from the 1940's and shower had mould in it. There is drywall cut out throughout it in various spots,exposed electric panel (drywall cutout around it) - odd you don't see the drywall cutouts in the photos??!! I raised all of this with the host and got various excuses/reasons why for all of this.,,,,
I stayed in it for 2 nights and had to leave. I asked for my money back and got nowhere. I realize Boston is an expensive city,"but stay elsewhere. for $1100 USD I was HUGELY disappointed. \"",,,,
4924009,33732846,2015-05-31,33318164,Carlo,"Stayed the weekend at Ahmed's place in Boston. Honestly,  there were some significant differences from the photos and description provided. Over a dozen holes in the walls,  most outlets didnt work,  no air conditioning were the major ones.  We weren't in the studio much so we still had a great trip. Location was good for visiting Boston. Basic amenenties provided."
4924009,34739040,2015-06-11,5107301,Adam,"My stay was excellent, Ahmed was an excellent host and everything was exactly as described. The property manager Eddie met me at the front door for my check-in, ran me through all the ins-and-outs of the room, and also gave me some helpful tips for navigating the local area."
Others have commented on the look of the apartment,but overall I didn't mind it at all. It's an older building,so expect a bit of wear and tear,but it had a full kitchen and fridge,the bed was comfortable and clean,and it was a GREAT location. The bathroom was a bit small
4924009,35327403,2015-06-17,32940601,Steve,"We stayed in this apartment for 2 nights and were pleased with our time there. For whatever reason we found it quite difficult to communicate with our host on days leading up to our stay. We were hoping to check in a bit early and were unable to contact anyone until the day we arrived and fortunately finally talked to Ahmed who passed us on to someone who we coordinated our arrival with. Although temporarily frustrating, we were able to access the apartment without any further trouble and still a little bit early."
"A small apartment with the basic necessities we enjoyed our short stay. It was nice being able to watch tv when it rained for a short time. Didn't have any soap or anything in the shower but all in all a good experience.\"",,,,,
4924009,37150644,2015-07-05,99411,Dan,"This studio is a 3rd floor walk-up (so I hope you're traveling light) though it's located in a great part of town that is very convenient to the theatre district & Boston Common.  The building and unit itself, however, are still both very much in an ongoing state of renovation. If Ahmed had been a little more forthcoming about this fact in his listing, I'd have probably been a bit more understanding/less disappointed when I arrived, but since it was presented as being a good bit nicer than it was in actuality, well, suffice it to say that I was a bit disappointed upon my arrival. That being said, Boston is an expensive city and housing often seems to come at a premium, so whether you're on a budget or not, you're probably going to be hard-pressed to find anything private in this same area for less than $250 a night, so I suppose that it's best to be prepared for less than ideal accommodations if/when you do. If you're ok with the prospect of quasi economical urban camping, then you should be fine enough with this listing, but if you're looking for a place that's been wholly & completely renovated, or are simply accustomed to getting a good bit more bang for your buck as I have apparently become, then this place is probably not for you, at least not as of this posting. In the 4 years that I've been using AirBnB, this was one of the most expensive properties that I've ever booked, yet at the same time, it was of the lowest standards I've ever encountered."
In addition to the frequent trash piles often left in the hallways of the building,the numerous holes in the walls,exposed outlets and dangling electrical wires,the bathtub also needs replacing as it is significantly stained and mildewed,and for some reason,the entire building also lost power for six hours one night. Additionally
4924009,38730016,2015-07-18,2589375,Austin,"The host was very easy to work with and very timely in response. During the visit we interacted with his assistant, who was very helpful and timely to accomodate our stay. Overall the listing is pretty accurate - it's definitely an older building and you can tell. However, it does exactly what you need it to - great place to sleep, clean, friendly, and a fantastic location. It's a great, central location to go explore Boston."
4924009,39417121,2015-07-23,21059638,Henrik,We came to enjoy the location in Chinatown and nearness to Common Park & Back Bay. Eddie the supervisor was of great assistance on various occasions!
4924009,40483588,2015-07-31,9390941,Kelley,"This studio apartment served my purposes, particularly in it's location, but I have to say it was right at the edge of my creepy tolerance level. The studio itself is ok, although there are a few raw parts still in need of completion - and the bathroom is small in a way that makes the toilet challenging to use (normal sized person here). The window looks straight into a small well at other windows, and a fire escape stair is beside it. It's the entry and hallway in the building that is particularly sceevy, not that that is in Ahmed's control - but it is a factor. One should be used to some rugged accommodations before staying here."
4924009,41057282,2015-08-04,23819374,Thomas,"As the other comments mentioned, the building itself is not the most welcoming place with its exposed wires, trash bags in the hallways and dangling light fixtures. The apartment, however was much nicer. There were a few negative points (holes in the wall, stained/mildewed bathtub) but overall our experience was very positive. We had a great stay there, and you really can't beat the location: it is within walking distance of everything and a perfect place to explore the city when you're there for just a few days. It is right next to Boston Common and Chinatown, which offers plenty of choices for food."
4924009,41410302,2015-08-07,12639541,Lien,The location of this apartment is perfect. The apartment itself is not so nice. I think it is quiet expensive for what you get.

He ensured someone was available to check us in, show us around, and make us feel welcome.  They were quick to respond to my questions."

1) I never met Ahmed,only Eddie,his friend...,,,
2)Ahmed is very precautions,no calls,no sms,no (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN).. weird and lots of drama.,,
3)The apartment is smaller what I was thinking about. expensive because the buiding is really in bad conditions.,,,,,
4) Every morning waking up at 8 am,workers making noisies fixing the building. It was compulsory and I demanded as a priority DO NOT BE DISTURBED,and next day I checked in,he said they will be fixing the building.,,
5) After checking in I didn't have any contact with Ahmed,I was complaining about the noise and I texted Eddie,and he said he doesn't work with that ) that Ahmed is the one dealing with reservations trying to find if he can find another apartment. Ahmed said no,and I didn't like his way just asking for me to explain and he was giving me silly reasons saying that the noisies from the apartment above probably they took the carpet out and that's why I hear the woman walking.,,
6) 2 floors by stairs,Forget it if u have big suitcase like me! No elevator because building is very old.,,,,
7) The bathroom need renovation URGENTLY,decoration from 30 s.,,,,
POSITIVES.,,,,,
1) Hot water in shower and restroom in just seconds.,,,,,
2) Location is very central.,,,,,
3) Eddie brought an iron as I requested.,,,,,

4924009,56750177,2015-12-17,240316,John,"All the good reviews are true and the apt is just as pictured, but unfortunately the review about construction noise is also true, at least currently (Dec 2015)."
Good news is future renters will have brand new windows,bad news is I was the one woken at 7:30 am and told to leave the apt because they were putting them in,followed by ungodly noise as they broke the windows across the airshaft so I couldn't just refuse and go back to sleep.,,,
With a noon checkout I think it's reasonable to expect to sleep till 10,but if you need to I'd suggest waiting till Feb 2016 or so before trying this building (though I bet he can charge more once the work is finished). If you're an early riser this is not a problem,"and otherwise the price and location can't be beat.\"",,,

The stairs are a bit shotty in the building; but the apartment is wonderful and makes up for it. Everything you need is stocked and available inside. Overall I was happy with my stay and would most certainly book Ahmed's place again and again!"
4924009,59569666,2016-01-12,48187490,Matías,Check in at 3pm was very punctual. The neighborhood was awsome and right in the middle of the historical trail and theater district.  The apartement was warm and cozy.
Cons:,,,,,
- the bathroom is DISGUSTING. black stains in the tub,"dirty vents. but the worst was the toilet: it was so near the sink on the right and the wall on the left that you litteraly don't have space to \"\"sit\"\" properly (my elbows would hit the sink or the wall when i tried to wipe!).",,,,
- the foam in the matress was really thin,you could feal the wood underneath,,,,
- the apartment was dirty. there was dust over the kitchen and the fridge that looked like it had been accumulating during months! i dont know why i paid for cleaning service...,,,,,

The location of the studio is wonderful - very close to Boston Common and multiple T lines. Getting around was really easy via subway or walking.
The building is old and the neighborhood can be a little noisy at night....frequent sirens due to fire/medical nearby. The bathroom is small and shows wear,and the air vent could use a cleaning,but we found everything functional and when problems arose,Eddie and the building super responded very quickly. The mattress was a thin Ikea one as other reviewers have noted,but we slept fine. It was nice to have the small kitchen and decent-sized fridge so we didn't have to eat out for every meal.,

If you're looking for a brand new,modern type of stay,this is not for you. The bathroom needed some improvements,but didn't bother us at all because we weren't in Boston to stay in a room all weekend,we were there to explore the city! It was perfect for our purposes.,
The hosts were wonderful! The building manager let us store our bags before we could check in,we had an early check in and they installed a window air conditioner when it got too hot!,,,,

I never met the host, or the elusive Eddie (friend of host) but they had keys all ready to go for me, and someone came to let me into the building no problem.  That person and Eddie were very nice and responsive.  The apartment was fine other than it really needed cleaning (food and dirt on floor in kitchen, hair in shower that wasn't mine) and the mattress is beyond bad, thin wasn't the issue it just has huge dents from being overused.  You get what you pay for with this place.  Great location but CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED."

The apt is very old; the shower on arrival did not work at all, but they fixed it in no time by sending a \"\"plumber\"\" that lived in the same house. So +1 for that responsiveness"
In general the place is kinda dirty and does not feel it gets the attention it deserves. Bathroom and main room are affected by that similarly - including the fridge and kitchen elements.,,,,,
Good part is that the apt is really in good chinatown/downtown boston location.,,,,,
Due to our problems we had to change to the hostel near by. I would recommend to not rent this place especially if you are not travelling alone or if you want a clean place. The bed is too small to accommodate two comfortably and the bathroom is also very tiny with toilet being almost under the sink.,,,,,

4924009,88901979,2016-07-25,43456402,Bruno,Great location and price. The room is clean and the location is fantastic!
4924009,90185960,2016-07-31,31117875,Darek,Ahmed did a great job accommodating me and was readily available to give me access to the unit when I arrived.
The unit itself is accurately depicted in the photos but is located in a very run down building - not a problem,but worth knowing.  It's also worth noting that there is no elevator and the building entrance door does not lock.  The unit was clean and air was fresh (despite cigarette smelling hallways).  The bathroom is clean,but very old (shower/bathtub needs a face lift).,,,
Overall,I was pleased with the experience and the unit's location is excellent.  It's within walking distance to everything.  Great for someone travelling on their own.,,,,
"Thank you Ahmed!\"",,,,,
4924009,91213100,2016-08-04,2537996,Pamela,"The studio is a bit rough, but a good value for the money because it is clean and in a great location right near Boston Commons and the Boylston T.  The bed could be more comfortable, but if you are not a light sleeper, go for it!"
4924009,92234617,2016-08-08,27654811,Jay,Great location and clean. Very responsive. Had a great time.
4924009,93674970,2016-08-13,77698785,Megan,"A little bit of a late start to checking in because of rain, but overall Eddie (one of Ahmed's associates) was very accommodating and friendly about getting me in as soon as possible. The location seems sketchy at first, but the longer I stayed the more comfortable I felt. The building is old, and that's something you have to take into consideration upon entering! Overall, I would stay again. It was a great location central to everywhere."
4924009,93961650,2016-08-14,40713257,庭瑋,"The landlord is very nice,and I like the decorations in the house."
But I think that if the sound-proofing can be Stronger is better.,,,,,

8090623,47825773,2015-09-21,30214828,Laura,"Lovely home, accommodating host!  Thomas offers a stay in a gorgeous home in the perfect city location.  An  amazing roof top terrace offers a beautiful view of the  Charles River and the flat is located within walking distance of the myriad of Charles Street shops, as well as, much of the rest of the city.  For further exploration, the subway, trolley, and bus system are equally accessible.  As we were in the city for a family gathering, our time with Thomas was limited; however, for those unfamiliar with the city, he definitely would be able to offer advice and suggestion as to making the most of your Boston experience.  We would definitely consider another stay!"

We arrived late in the evening and he met us outside the front door to make sure we got in OK.  He proceeded to take us on a short tour of the neighborhood, and Beacon Hill is wonderful.  His hometown and neighborhood  knowledge helped us tremendously and we found our way around with relative ease and enjoyed some of the local establishments at his recommendation."
"The space was nice with rooftop access offering a place to relax and enjoy tremendous views of the city.  I hope to be back to Boston in the near future and would be lucky to find his place available.  The value was worth it.\"",,,,,

Tom's apartment is extremely clean and has everything you need to be comfortable -- including two cute puppies who like to cuddle.  Tom is kind, informative, and very accommodating.  I placed my request on the same day that I needed the room and it wasn't a problem.  I would highly recommend staying at Tom's."

- getting curtains that can block light more effectively,,,,,
- outfitting closet with nicer hangers,,,,,

This apartment is a phenomenal location on Comm Ave, walking distance to green line T stops, Copley Square, Newbury Street, Kenmore Square - basically perfectly located in Back Bay. The apartment was cozy and charming, great shower and kitchenette. The mattress is quite firm but very comfortable - not a problem for us. Also of note  is the décor which gave the room a charming character (grandfather clock, old paintings, wood floors). Overall this is a fantastic find and I would recommend to anyone visiting Boston."

This one is bigger than the other. So I got enough space to unpack our two large pieces of luggage. And the apartment is really close to the T. It makes the apartment an excellent choice especially for the travelers who have a lot of luggages. I definitely will choose to stay here next time.

However the review does not state that there is a family living here, who were perfectly fine but I prefer to stay in places away from small kids.  Just a heads up"
4967219,30443672,2015-04-22,10624609,Mark,"We enjoyed our stay. Anthony communicated well and was well organized. Room was clean, well lit, sunny, warm. Bed comfortable. Desk, drawers, closet, small sofa, bottled water included. Plenty of space for 2. Room is part of 3 bedroom apartment with one shared bathroom. Anthony's family of four live in the apartment, but were away for most of our stay.  A second, smaller bedroom had another airbnb couple for the weekend. Apartment is on 3rd floor, 4 flights of steep stairs from street level. Received large, clean, soft bath towels when requested. Savin Hill T close and convenient. From Logan, take SL1 to South Station and then Red Line to Savin Hill. Close to Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants on Dorchester Ave. Savin Hill Bar & Kitchen restaurant close and good too. Not aware of hot tub, washer or dryer, but did not ask about them. Close to shore line (water), nice for walking or running. Apartment is right on freeway but noise did not bother us. Might be more of an issue if windows were open. Overall enjoyed our stay and would like to stay again next time we are in Boston. Thanks to Anthony and his family for welcoming us into their home!"
4967219,30790672,2015-04-27,12012751,Hilda,Very convenient location and nice room!!! Recommendation!
4967219,31111880,2015-05-02,2930327,Jason,I don't have much to add to these other reviews.  They and the photos are quite accurate.  The house is indeed literally a one minute walk to the Savin Hill T stop.  I was attending a meeting at the convention center and this was a fantastic way to save money and still be reasonably close to the meeting.  You could even take a taxi from Anthony's house and still come out WAY ahead of booking a hotel by the convention center.
The bed was comfortable,there is plenty of closet space,a desk,bottled water provided,functional wi-fi/internet.  A great,basic accommodation.  If you go into this space not expecting a hotel and realize you're paying a very good price for a place to stay in Boston
The truth is,I barely saw Anthony.  I saw him for a total of maybe 30 seconds,but when I did see him,he was quite friendly.  We stayed in touch via text message (prompt responses) and I had no problems with him as a host.   A had a few questions that were responded to quickly.,,
I kept to the room,but didn't feel unwelcome to use the living room.  That said,there are other people in this space.  Anthony's sister and her young child (adorable).  There is also another room that gets rented out.  There seemed to be only one bathroom,so waiting for the bathroom might be an issue from time to time for some,but was not an issue for me.,
Also,the living room had quite a lot of clutter in it given the small kid and her toys and craft projects and whatnot,however,again,this is not something that bothered me as I used this space primarily for sleeping and kept to the bedroom which was clean and orderly when I arrived.  However,if you're someone who is looking for a common space to hang out in during your stay (i.e. not your bedroom)
Lastly,I was worried that highway noise would be a problem after seeing the photos for the listing.  The house does literally overlook the highway.  However,at least with this particular bedroom,I did not find it intrusive at all.  I also sleep with white noise (from my phone),so maybe take that with a grain of salt,but even when that wasn't on
"Thanks Anthony!\"",,,,,
4967219,31468692,2015-05-05,31254997,Woraya,"Although it's my 1st time in Boston and was a very short stay for a night, I had a very great welcoming from Anthony.He's very kind and full of service minded, helped me alot such as giving pieces of advice for restaurant, places to visit or even how to access to his house. He also cared about me during my travelling alone in Boston by texting me to keep update about my (URL HIDDEN) more big thing was he helped driving me to the Airport early morning at 04:30 to take a flight to Washington D.C. For the accommodation, the room was so clean, had enough space to relax and keep stuffs, bathroom was also nice to use. It was easy to access to any places by taking red line metro,the station was about 2-3 mins walk from the house.I love this place and if I have a chance to visit Boston again, I will definitely stay at his place. Thanks alot again for your big help and warm-hearted welcoming that made my trip in Boston so wonderful."

4967219,39175506,2015-07-21,31986948,Natalie,"This location is amazing! Steps from both the subway (the T) and the beach, which is so convenient. As far as the actual room goes, it was clean and good for a night's sleep. The apartment is on the third floor so it could be an inconvenience if you have a lot of luggage. Also, the apartment can get pretty warm in the summer time, but there is an A/C in the room which is definitely nice. I didn't have any interaction with Anthony during our stay, but he was very responsive to questions before our arrival. Overall, it was a great place to stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if I ever find myself in Boston."

4967219,39498079,2015-07-24,28719254,Dave,Anthony was very good and communication and helpful with check in and out. Didn't actually met him. The people in the property we very friendly although didn't speak English. The room was spotless and had air con. Location was perfect less than 5 min walk to subway so really easy to get into centre and some really nice restaurants close by. The road noise didn't bother us at all.
4967219,40000920,2015-07-27,36443585,Katie,"I didn't get to meet Anthony personally, but I did reach him easily on the phone when contacting him about checking in! His family welcomed me and my cousin into the home and we got situated easily. The room was great-just as advertised, and the air conditioner worked well after a long day out on the town. His house was right across from the subway, that was easy to navigate and took us downtown. In the morning his aunt was very kind and made us breakfast! Anthony's place was very accommodating and I would definitely recommend it to anyone needing to stay in Boston!"
4967219,40321315,2015-07-30,4969829,Richi,Anthony was very reliable and answered  all my questions with quick response.

It is so convenient to the Metro station and also, Boston is such a place that you can get anywhere you want with a metro station. thanks! Hope can come back again!"
4967219,41686881,2015-08-08,39697072,Maria Camila,Excelente ubicacion a unos pocos pasos de la estacion del tren. El barrio muy agradable y la habitacion muy limpia y comoda :)
4967219,42258450,2015-08-12,32690740,Thomas,"The room was as described. It was very loud because of the Highway directly in front of the house. The T-Station was in 2 minute Walk distance. Anthony organized everything perfectly for us, but we did not meet him face2face. The communication with his family members was hard, they dont speak english."
4967219,42848247,2015-08-16,34780449,Seth,The location is great just a minute walk to the T and there is a beach just minutes away as well as jogging paths.   We didn't see Anthony but everything was as described in the posting.  He and his wife were readily available by email and cell to answer questions we had.  The on street parking was very convenient.

4967219,44358491,2015-08-25,22546360,Avanti,Thank you Anthony! Everything was very comfortable. The house was very conveniently located near the subway so it was easy to get around.

The room was warm and cozy, and everyone we saw (other travelers, Anthony’s family) were very nice. It is noisy, but for us it was good background noise to fall asleep to. You might have to wait for the bathroom, but otherwise it’s a great place to stay!"

4967219,46871775,2015-09-14,34171496,Jonas,Anthony was a really nice and friendly host. You can get really fast to the train and to south station. (FYI: The last train goes around midnight). Unfortunately the toilette and our room were not very clean.
4967219,47083714,2015-09-15,34270949,晓悦,"A good place to stay,and very near to the metro station.I left my watch in the (URL HIDDEN),Anthony informed me of this."

The room was very sunny and clean. We had enough space. There's a small desk,small furniture to hang your clothes and a mini sofa. It was all very convenient.,,,,
Anthony perfectly explained us how to reach the house and get the keys,it was all very easy.,,,,
Nevertheless,there's a little negative point,the room is pretty noisy. There's the highway just close by the house. But with ear plugs,we slept perfectly.,,
"It was a very nice place to stay for visiting Boston !!\"",,,,,
4967219,48581772,2015-09-27,26073257,Christiane,Anthony had sent us perfect information before we came. Unfortunately at that time we hadn't understood that the text message we had received was not the complete information and that the lacking part was standing in an extra email- thus when we arrived it took us a bit of time to understand how everything was going on ;-) The room was nice and clean and the public transport into Boston very easy. Just for people who are very sensitive to noise it can be very loud because of the nearby highway .
4967219,48681625,2015-09-28,32958774,Ilaria,The room is very bright and it is only two steps to the train that brings you downtown Boston! For that I recommend it to those who want to get easily to the city because it's not far at all!
I was there with my boyfriend just for one night but honestly if we had booked for more nights I would have rather spent the double of the price and booked a hotel room... the bathroom was very dirty,hairs all over the floor and we wouldn't have managed to have a shower there if we weren't together! We didn't want to touch anything indide the bathroom! And since there it lives a family we didn't feel comfortable to use the kitchen and other spaces in common....,,,,
Anyway the room was clean,but since it is beside a high traffic road and the train it is noisy as hell! We were tired,"that's why we had no problem to sleep!\"",,,
4967219,48893252,2015-09-29,39726017,Hayri,"Location of this house is really perfect. 2 min to subway on foot and and with subway you can reach wherever you want. Anthony and his family is kind and hospitable. The only problem is that they don't English except Anthony. Sometimes it can be hard to communicate with them cuz or that. He also allowed us for late check-in. However, on our last day nobody was at home and we had little problem to take out luggages from his home. To sum up, i recommend this pretty house, you won't be regret. Thank you for your hosting Anthony!"
4967219,49217118,2015-10-02,11411460,Aleksandra,"Although we didn't meet Anthony personally, we had a pleasant stay at his appartment. The room was clean and big, the AC worked fine but earplugs are a must if you're a light sleeper. We didn't use the kitchen and the bathroom is shared with all the rooms."
The communication with Anthony is great,he responded very quickly to every message and when we arrived,"a family member was there to show us the room (not speaking English but we managed to communicate :)). It was a good experience overall.\"",,,

4967219,50290548,2015-10-11,41467191,Kyuwon,"I thought that my first Airbnb experience was okay. I really liked the room at Anthony's place, but right, the noise outside next to the highway was extremely disturbing. But then, the location being accessible to the public transportation was awesome, and the price was reasonable. I wouldn't go back to it just because I found the bathroom floor not clean at all for having a guest over. But I would prefer coming here than choosing a hotel because I felt safer and more like home in this place."
4967219,50830257,2015-10-15,34398324,Pierre-Luc,"We stayed at Anthony’s place for 4 nights. It was our first Airbnb experience and after that, maybe our last."
We actually never met Anthony but only had contact with his family (as least we thing it was his family). She could barely speak english and we had a really hard time communicating.,,,,,
When we arrived we found hairs in the bed. There was no flat sheet,only a fitted sheet. We had to sleep with the duvet cover in direct contact. They were no other blankets and the room gets really cold as it it drafty. There was a bad smell in all of the appartement.,,,,
The worst part; The bathroom. It was smelly moldy and overall dirty. There was hair on the floor and the sink. The walls were covered in dirt and leftover glue from message that were glued on the walls. All hand towels were wet and smelly so we had nothing to dry our hands after washing them. The bathtub was moldy and very dirty. There is no fan in the bathroom and the window was always left closed so it smelled bad. We always felt dirtier after leaving the bathroom. The sink counter was always covered in water that was droping on the floor. The bath mat was always soaking wet. Towels were not provided. The timeframe to use the bathroom was also impossible. Since we couldn’t communicate with the family,we never knew when it was ok to take showers or even go to the bathroom. There was only one bathroom for everybody so it was almost always in use. When it wasn’t,it was even dirtier than before. Each morning,after the family used the bathroom,the lady would use the bathroom sink to clean and rinse her mop,there was brown dirt water and hair everywhere. Only after that we could use the bathroom and by then
We were also supposed to have acces to the kitchen but it was so dirty  (food from the night before still on the table,plastic bags full of stuff on the counters) and there wasn’t any space for us. We only wanted to put a take out box in the fridge and there weren’t any space.   The pictures that you can see on the page are clearly of before they moved into the appartement,,,,
The pictures are also not of the present bedroom used. Furniture is not all the same.,,,,,
We would not go back. The price of the room is high for such a bad experience. It is also very noisy,even with earplugs we could ear the Highway.,,,,

4967219,51273955,2015-10-19,14262853,Marijn,Although my girlfriend and I never got to meet Anthony check in went smooth with the instructions provided. Our stay was pleasant! The room was big and clean and the bed comfortable. One night it was pretty cold  and we were provided with an extra heater which we really appreciated! Communication with the Family that also lives there was minimal because of not speakng English. Nevertheless we felt welcome all the time.
4967219,51518830,2015-10-20,46883943,Donna,I never met Anthony.  He emailed after 1030 at night to see if I had any questions.

The room was ok and price was reasonable. Host was nice even though we couldn't communicated but she tried her best to help and also we got a little girl helping to translate. Be Careful if you are living room#3 door knob couldn't be locked from inside it would like a trap and it took us to open the door like 30 mins. There was only 1 bathroom in the apartment ( We have to say that as We don't think it is a house, it look more like 3 bedroom apartment to us) it could be traffic to use a bathroom and it's not clean enough!!!! Rugs were wet, toilet bowl cover had some sticky black dirt on it. I gave 3/5 as everything was quite nice if comparing with the price."

4967219,52586678,2015-10-31,29814086,Victor,We just spent one night in this room. The communication with Anthony was very good. There is park space outside and easy to arrive. It is located in a neighboorhood with Vietnam population. Someone from Anthony's family was at home when we arrived. She didn't talk English but she showed us what we needed. It was an usual room next to a main road (a bit noisy but we slept anyway) with TV and heating.

pictures are not accurate.,,,,,
the kitchen is so disgusting that the only thing we,very cautiously,used was the toaster.,,,
the disgusting kitchen causes the entire apartment to smell bad.,,,,,
bedroom is 'clean enough'.,,,,,
did not meet anthony,but he seemed nice via text,email,"etc.\"",,
4967219,53941343,2015-11-14,48522835,Mena,The trip went smoothly and Anthony was very communicative and accommodating. The bedroom is in a walk-up apartment- very conveniently located by the train station (red line). Great location if you are visiting colleges in Cambridge because the Red line takes you strait to Harvard Sq and MIT. Even if you bring a car you would save so much time and money taking the train (parking in Boston/Cambridge is a nightmare).
The bedroom is nice and clean!  The bed is comfortable for two. There is also a space heater in case it gets cold. And the TV was a pleasant surprise! We brought an extra blanket and pillow and it was definitely a good idea! Also consider bringing your own house slippers because the owners do not allow shoes inside.,,,,,
"Overall I would recommend staying here for a night or two if you are swinging through Boston. \"",,,,,
4967219,55193533,2015-11-29,20777631,Beatriz,"It was what I expected. Really a very clean place. Although it is located right in front an avenue, the traffic noises were not disturbing. I recommend it."
4967219,56747998,2015-12-17,48376210,Crystal,"The room is clean and big, location is really good. But the air in the room is not that fresh because the windows are sealed. Also you would be living on 2nd or 3rd floor, we have very heavy luggages and that's a pain. Anthony is very nice though."
4967219,56900925,2015-12-19,49050886,Wantong,"The experience here is really great. Real close to the train and the little town. It would be totally fine if you return not too late. Water is hot, rome is big enough for two. Windows are big, and not noisy though so close to the train. After all pretty great, wish I came earlier."
4967219,57014459,2015-12-21,17953312,Philipp,"Positive: Private room, very clean, located 2 mins walking distance from the t-station (12 mins with the train to downtown). Also the bathroom was nice and clean. Anthony is a polite and friendly host. We could check in right at 2pm (earliest possible check in time). There is a TV and a fridge in the room."
Negative: The room was cold when we arrived until we found out how to turn on the heating. To have it warm at night,you have to leave the heating on which means that the light emitted by the heating will also be on. On the second day,"the bathroom floor was completely wet. It's not possible to open the windows for fresh air because there is plastic between the windows and the shades on the inside.\"",,,

4967219,57800504,2015-12-29,43778329,Songyuan,It was really cold outside when I was in Boston. And Anthony's place don't have central heating but there is one radiator working in the room. The windows were sealed by plastic film but you can still feel a little wind blowing in. I thought it would be cold that night but I didn't feel anything after falling into sleep. Maybe it is because I was too tired. The house is just one minute walking to metro station. Really convenient. It is not a bad experience anyway.
4967219,58857112,2016-01-05,42967571,Annika,"First of all, Anthony and his family was nice and friendly and tried to make our stay most comfortable as possible under the rooming conditions. However, the room was incredible cold, the windows were covered with kind of plastic wrap to keep the wind and cold away but it did not work out at all. The room faces the highway and it was horrible noisy as well during the day as well as in the night! It was very difficult to fall aslepp as a matter of fact."
4967219,59211479,2016-01-08,48202394,Doris,"The location is very convenient which only takes 2 mins to red line subway on foot, and red line can bring you to many attractions."
The bedroom is spacious and clean,but the bathroom is acceptable because it's public use. By the way,"the door lock is broken which we spent much time managing to open the door. Hope the host can improve it :)\"",,,
4967219,59667438,2016-01-13,53453874,Linjie,"first of all, I have to say thank you so much for the bedroom. the location is great, which just took us 2 minutes to go to the red line subway station. And the neighborhood is very kind."
However,I have to say,the bedroom is so cold that we can't sleep well at night. During the time in Boston,it snows,but the center heater doesn't work,even we opened the electric heater
all in all,"the bedroom is good and it worth the price. Thank you Anthony!\"",,,,
4967219,59808704,2016-01-15,9841755,Long,"I have used airbnb for almost 3 years, either by my own account or my sister's account, and I have to say this was my worst experience ever. I honestly never want to write anything negative when leaving comments, reviews, but last night was just too much for me. The biggest problem was the heater. It was ok during the 1st night, just a little bit loud. But on the 2nd night, it started to make very loud and weird noises periodically, about 1-2 times per hour, for the whole night. When I left the place, it was still making loud noises and all that completely ruined my night. I almost could not sleep the whole night, it was like a long nightmare, and the next day was a long day for me. I messaged host, he replied instantly but there wasnt anything that he could have done. I dont know if it has happened to anyone before, or I was just unlucky, but that was really the worst night ever I had using airbnb.This was a horrible experience."
In addition,the bed was really bad. It kept collapsing very frequently although I was really gentle,and I had to keep fixing it. I cant even turn myself normally during night because it may collapse again. It was a really bad bed.,,,
Again,I never want to post a negative comment,but this was just too much for me. I guess the only cons is that parking is easily available,and maybe a relatively low price. But still,I think for that price I can get a better place where I can at least sleep peacefully at night.,
Lastly,Anthony was easy to contact with,"he replied me instantly.\"",,,
4967219,60130390,2016-01-19,35906223,Barbara,"Nice neighborhood, quiet as far as foot traffic and immediate road traffic goes. Free parking on street, but that can get filled up at the wrong time of day. Unfortunately, the house is situated directly next to I-93, so lights and highway noise 24/7. Never met the host, don't know if he even lives here. Did meet other guests, plus someone who I think lived there? Not sure, as we were unable to communicate in English. Everyone I met was very nice. House rules didn't indicate whether it was okay to use kitchen to make hot water for tea in the morning. Had continual trouble with lock on door room. First lock was changed out, second lock also stuck. Easy foot access to open space on beach, but walking to UMass campus is not as convenient, involving a larger detour to foot bridge across major road. Easy MBTA access - the station is right on the other side of the highway."

4967219,63937050,2016-02-28,17242786,Olivia,"Anthony is very accommodating. He is very reliable by text, he is flexible for check-in time and lets you keep to yourself and go about your travels. The apartment looks just like his pictures, it is just across the street from the subway line, and it's 20 minutes to get into the city center (by the main train station and theater district). It's 40 minutes to BU, or Cambridge area. It's very easy to get around, and there are some restaurants/bars around if you don't feel like going back into the city. There is a bar called dBar that is said to have a good brunch, and McKenna's was packed. A heads up for early birds, there isn't much that is open before 11am for brunch on the weekends. Also, if you're into Vietnamese food, there are plenty of supermarkets with hot food & pho. (But these are mostly  cafeteria style, asian bento box style set ups, not sit down restaurants.) Thanks Anthony, you were a great host!!"

4967219,72271944,2016-05-01,4155193,Rafael & Marie,We did not have the opportunity to meet Anthony in person but he made sure to provide us with all the information we needed to get to his apartment. He was also available by phone during the whole time of our stay.
The location of his place is ideal as it is located at less than 5 minutes walking distance from the train station. From there you can go everywhere you want in Boston.,,,,,
The apartment is shared with Anthony's roommates,they are polite and so quiet that you will barely notice they are there.,,,,
The bedroom as well as the common areas were perfectly clean.,,,,,
The bedroom is equipped with a heater that works very well and will keep you warm all night even when the weather is very cold outside.,,,,,

4967219,72736975,2016-05-04,67638578,Anton,"The place is located really close to the train station. Besides the room was clean and the self-checkin procedure was very convinient. We haven't met the host, but other roomates were very quiet. However, one should take into account that the place is really close to a highway and the windows aren't noiseproof (and cold-) enough."
4967219,74909053,2016-05-17,53158992,Paul,Fast response. Room is clean.
There is a portable heater in the room,good for low temperature night.,,,,

The neighborhood is near the freeway and the red T, which is convenient. However, the noise from the freeway and trains was quite disturbing. It was hard to sleep the first night even though we had ear plugs on. Overall, we had a good time in Boston. Thank you Anthony!"
"\"",,,,,
4967219,76075033,2016-05-24,61812449,Nayeli,"Although we never met our host the process was smooth and easy. The only difficulty we had at the beginning was parking since it was on a Monday and there are limitations as to where you can park, but he was quick to respond and let us know we could use the driveway. It's also really close to public transportation!"
4967219,76398085,2016-05-27,72115219,翘航,Soooooo convenient place!Only 1 minutes to subway.All the things you need is been prepared well by host.
4967219,76486928,2016-05-27,30631859,K.C.,"Anthony's private room was clean, spacious and really a very convenient one minute walk to the T. We used his place to stay 1 night and travel further via train to NY. We did not meet him, but he helped us out by texting and was fast in his replies. The shower was clean and warm. I talked to his mother or aunt and she was very welcoming."
As it is right next to a freeway,when we did not use the air conditioning,we could hear the constant traffic. Since a family is living there and using the kitchen a lot,I did not feel comfortable to use the kitchen area.,,
For the low price,"it was the perfect place for us to hop through towards NY by train.\"",,,,

The only con is that the room is next to a highway and it gets really noisy at night. If you are a light sleeper,"this place is probably not for you.\"",,,,
4967219,80008310,2016-06-15,14586565,Mathilde,Anthony a été très arrangeant pour que l'on dépose nos valises avant le check-in. L'appartement est bien situé mais décidément trop bruyant (proximité de l'autoroute).
"Anthony allowed us to drop off our luggages before check-in time. His place is very close to the station and the freeway. Convenient but very noise.\"",,,,,
4967219,80191301,2016-06-16,61621261,Claire Hyunjung,"Very close to subway(Savin hill). Even you can see the house in subway station and access to downtown in 15 min. No elevator (3rd floor), some noise from nearby highway at night, but clean, cozy room and comfort rbed, fully eqipped, and reasonable price. I couldn't meet Anthony in person, but he was good at arranging the resevation and telling me how to get to the staying from airport. I highly recommend!"
4967219,80493975,2016-06-18,3131401,Suyoung,Easy to communicate with. Family was living next door for extended stay and they were very helpful. Can be a bit scary at night to walk just because it is very quiet. Overall good experience.

We didn't get to meet each other but he's always available whenever I messaged him. The place was clean and near the train station, which was good for transportation access but at the same time, rather noisy from the trains. It was on the 3rd floor and I wished it was mentioned on the listing because we had big luggages, also the bathroom is shared among 2 other rooms. But overall, good value for the money we spent."
4967219,83389402,2016-07-02,64043424,Judith,"We only stayed one night in our room. It was comfortable and clean, but unfortunatelly hot."

4967219,85719405,2016-07-12,64591476,Amandine,"Nice private room in clean and welcoming residential area. The subway in one minute in feet is very enjoyable, nevertheless, the expressway below the house remains unpleasant, in particular the night."
4967219,87166177,2016-07-18,4549223,Megan,"Anthony responded to all my communication very promptly, and he accommodated our need to park and drop off bags before check-in time.  The room was exactly as pictured (plus an A/C unit!), and the location was ideal for hopping on the T to get into the city in about 15-20 minutes.  At night, the road sounds were a bit loud, so I recommend guests bring ear plugs.  Overall, a great value for a quick trip to Boston!"
4967219,89623859,2016-07-29,84758746,潇,Nice home. Comfortable bed.
4967219,90422973,2016-08-01,35731843,Kristine,"Anthony responded to all my communications very promptly, usually within one-two minutes. The room looked just like the photo and it was comfortable, spacious and clean. The free street parking without time limit was very convenient. Anthony also mentioned that we can use his driveway to park if we could not find a parking space. However, I wish it was mentioned on the listing that we are sharing the bathroom with the other two rooms, including a family. When I first stepped into the bathroom, I was surprised there was a washing machine standing in the middle of the bathroom and someone was using it. But overall, reasonable and fair price in Boston area. Thank you, Anthony!"
4967219,92886480,2016-08-10,88246804,Weiye,"It is a really convenience house. The host is very nice. We check in a little bit late and I miss the instruction Email, so I sent messages to the host and ask how to get in the house.He call back very soon and teach me with patience. Nice experience!"
4967219,93564934,2016-08-13,49571617,Jing,"The room is sunny and there is a separate fridge. As a whole, this one is larger and better than the other one in the apartment. However, it's a little bit noisy. Washing machine and fridge in the kitchen cannot be used and there is not very much communication between host and me. The host didn't answer some of the questions I asked, which makes me a little bit disappointed. Also, breakfast is not provided as the description. Anyway, it's close to subway station."

This action was so sweet or we would lost chance staying with a such nice host. He dropped off us to home when we were arrival and gave us a ride to subway when we were gone. That made us more easier because we had heavy luggages. We had a good conversation with him too. He was nice to talk. Besides, his son and his cat were so cute. And location was good as well.

Even before we took off to Boston, the communication was prompt, accurate and informative which made us really comfortable interacting our upcoming host. And, sure enough, they are one of the most generous and modest persons you could imagine. Since I had a training/conference opportunity near Boston, my wife and I decided to arrive a few days in advance and enjoy spending a weekend like locals – not just staying at drabby hotel room. And, as soon as we stepped into Sami’s house, we felt like this is our home away from home. The house was absolutely spotless, really cozy and quiet, yet welcoming atmosphere where everybody would relax and spend some quality time. Besides, there was an excellent public transportation system that allows you to get you in and out from downtown Boston easily. Naturally, as you walk into someone else’s house, we do need to respect our host as well as neighbors. Yet, as far as you have a common sense to stay just like you were invited to your friend’s house, your experience would be just wonderful. We are looking forward to have another stay at Sami’s place in the future. Thank you very much once again for having us to your lovely house."

753446,71771142,2016-04-28,15740747,Jon,Sami was a wonderful host! He made sure we were comfortable and was able to help us work around our weird schedule! Would highly recommend the accommodation.
753446,71886227,2016-04-29,11831795,Mireille,Sami is very sympathetic. This first stop in our trip is the first good souvenir from our holidays in the USA. The bed and accommodations are very good.  I recommend this home to stay.

He is overall very supportive and Chester, his cat is very cute. The bathroom is clean and has it all. The bedroom is neat and clean as well. My friend and I truly enjoyed our stay at Sami's. :-)"

L'appartement est très propre et bien rangé la salle de bain est grande et tout comme le reste de l'appartement elle est très propre."
"Merci Sami pour cet accueil et à bientôt j'espère.\"",,,,,
753446,75870426,2016-05-23,59244783,Violet,"My friend and I had a long layover (16h) in boston, and wanted a place to shower/nap. We contacted Sami and asked if we could use his place during the day, checking in at 9am and checking out in the evening. Sami was very accommodating, and said that would be no problem. He always responded to our messages within minutes, and gave us his cell phone number before our stay just in case we had any trouble finding the place."
The house is in a good location. Quiet neiborhood,easy to get to by public transit,and within walking distance of the Arnold Arboretum. The room and bathroom are clean,"and served our purpose of showering and napping perfectly. We were very happy that we found Sami and his place!\"",,
753446,76077179,2016-05-24,89693,Jade,"Sami and his apartment were wonderful. The room was comfortable, the bathroom was super clean, and the communication/coordination with Sami was easy and stress-free. I would certainly recommend, and I will personally try to stay here again!"
753446,76612943,2016-05-28,6986436,Kris & Laine,"When we first arrived we had run into some terrible traffic that had set our arrival time much later into the night than we had originally planned. Sami was very understanding and kind when we finally did arrive. The apartment is very clean and neat and easy to find. The room itself is slightly small and may not be the best option for travelers with a lot of luggage. Since we were traveling for over a month we had two people and four pieces of luggage so the room size was a bit too small but would do well for short stays and less luggage. The beds themselves are bunk beds and are not the most comfortable but will do for a short visit. We enjoyed our stay, the only part that was a bit difficult was the rule of no showers past 10. Understandably Sami's son stayed and went to sleep earlier however, when traveling in a new city it is often difficult to gage how long things will take and we found ourselves rushing back to try to take a shower before 10. All in all I would recommend for a short stay."
753446,77482261,2016-06-01,73238738,Ehsan,"Sami and his son, Joshua, were really nice and welcoming during our 3 nights of stay. Sami was very understanding and helpful. He gave us a ride one day on his way out, and was very accommodating overall."
The location is relatively easy with public transportation (one bus to the closest subway station). I would definitely recommend this location to stay.,,,,,

753446,77905931,2016-06-04,63005076,Tim,"We arrived in Boston on a Friday afternoon somewhat unfamiliar to the territory. I contacted Sami as soon as we were off the train and he helped us navigate the subway system to his place. It's less than a $7 Uber ride from the last stop on the Orange Line to Sami's place, and he even offered to come pick us up! Once we arrived at his place, he was extremely welcoming, we spoke about his vinyl collection and how excited we were to see the Red Sox play. When we left the next day, Sami waited with us while we waited for our Uber and we had a very pleasant conversation. Sami is a wonderful host, and if I ever visit Boston in the near future, he will be the first one I call."
753446,78527949,2016-06-07,64607736,Seven,The house really looks the same as the pictures and every room has different color (URL HIDDEN) really clean.Sami is really helpful and he pick us up at the subway station as we first arrived.And the neighborhood is nice.Near the neighborhood is a nice area with lovely restaurant and supermarket.
753446,78830257,2016-06-09,70395846,Emily,Our stay was pleasant and the location was about 25 minutes from the city. Sami was a great host and made us feel safe and comfortable. I would stay again!

753446,81665405,2016-06-24,76826138,Martin,"What can I say Sami was a remarkable host. My son and I has traveled to Boston to watch a game with out any reservations. Just because I didn't have an idea of what to do after. I had contacted Sami after the game and he opened his home to us. Sami is a very nice and pleasant host, my son loved his cat. It was nice to talk to him and get to know him a little on a personal basis."
Now as for the room,"it was perfect for us. We slept on a bunk bed. The room can be small if you have a lot of luggage and bed small if your tall. You be about 20 min from the ball park and 30 from bus station. I uber to get around and it was easy and affordable. I recommend Sami place to others looking to visit Boston he is reasonable on all aspects. \"",,,,
753446,82253585,2016-06-27,79169393,Shruthi,It was really great and Sami was a very warm and helpful host.

Overall a great AirBnb stay, that was just a short subway ride from downtown. Would gladly stay with him again!"
753446,85271313,2016-07-11,63468859,Brett,Sami was an extremely welcoming host! His place is very clean and organized. He provided us with towels and allowed us to use his Kureig! Bunk beds were comphy.
He is located a little outside the city,"so we used Uber most of the trip. There is a nice bike path that is fairly easy to get to from his place that will take you near the MFA without using much public road.\"",,,,
753446,85992493,2016-07-14,76751572,Regina,Sami is a great host. The location was just what we needed for a few days to access downtown south Boston.

When we asked him if we could do laundry, he said that he did not do laundry. Nevertheless, he used washer and dryer quiet often. It's not a problem if he just says \"\"sorry"

He was always available by (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), and he even wait for us to arrive. He even accept my reservation a day after my arrival (that was a life saver). The room is exactly like the photos and it's very clean. The area is very nice and secure, which is very near to a bus station and the subway!!! But if you have car, you can park it on the street. Thank you very much Sami! It was a fabulous experience being with you!"
753446,91116551,2016-08-03,35829016,Tina,Sami is a good host and he made us comfortable as home. The room is more warm and cozy than on the pictures. The place is about 5-10 mins far from the station and it's easy to find. Chester the cat is so friendly just like Sami!
753446,98351435,2016-08-30,90957621,Nikolas,This is a nice location for Boston and only a few minutes’ walk to restaurants nearby. Sami is a great host and his place is comfortable. The location is great and it only took about 20 minutes or so to drive downtown.
1197857,5353111,2013-06-25,4731222,Julie,We arrived very late in the middle of the night and found the apt to be clean and nicely air conditioned. There were extra linens and towels to accommodate all three of us.  The bed was comfy but the sofa bed wasn't unfortunately.  It was better for my friend to sleep directly on the sofa.
It can be noisy from street traffic even though we were on the top floor.  But that didn't really bother us.,,,,,
The unit is quite small for 3 adults but if it's just one or a couple,then there's enough room.  We appreciated that the condo was modern and minimally decorated.,,,,
It's pretty conveniently located and street parking on the block over the weekend was easy considering we were not residents and most neighborhoods require resident permits.  We also rented bikes that we rode around the city.  There is a bike rental area a block away,"on the same block as an awesome coffee shop called Render Coffee.  \"",,,,
1197857,5704245,2013-07-12,2821780,Nic,"Tidy, comfortable apartment. Smaller than it looks in the pictures, but still a nice size for one person. Enjoyable stay!"
1197857,6302335,2013-08-07,6857911,Marilyn,"We had a great stay here.  The location was ideal, so close to the Mass Ave. orange line, and easy walking distance to all the action in Back Bay and beyond.  We arrived early in the morning on a redeye from the West Coast, and Will was very accommodating, letting us check in early.  It was a bit small for a couple with two teenagers, but it met our needs just fine as we really weren't spending that much time in the apartment anyway.  We liked it much better than staying in a hotel--it's great to get up in the morning to your own coffee and breakfast, and occasionally eat dinner in as well.  Easy walking distance to grocery stores and restaurants--Estelle's and Parish Cafe just downstairs were great!  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 was the nighttime noise level, which wasn't a surprise given the other reviews.  We would definitely stay here again, just remember to bring ear plugs."
1197857,6787678,2013-08-25,6091709,Kristi,"This apartment was PERFECT for us! We stayed a week while we moved our daughter to Boston -- It's in a great location, very convenient to the Green Line or Orange Line T, walking distance to the Whole Foods, plenty of nearby restaurants.  Our daughter used the inflatable mattress for a couple of nights until her apartment was ready--that was a little cramped, but doable. Although the building is old, the apartment has been redone, with everything in it new; very clean, good A/C circulation, extra linens/towels. Yes, because of it's location, it is a little noisy at night (restaurants/bars/busy city scene), but no more so than any other big city location I've stayed in. This was my first Airbnb experience, and it could not have been better. Thank you, Will! We look forward to coming back! (PS: If I had been traveling alone, I probably couldn't have gotten my very large suitcase up the stairs by myself...next time I will travel lighter to navigate the stairs.)"
1197857,7581377,2013-09-25,1129430,Kyle,"It was a great place in a great location.  The only two downsides are that we stayed on the 4th floor so there was a lot of walking up and down with no elevator, and the traffic could get a bit loud, but you're in the heart of Boston so that can't be helped.  My girlfriend and I had a great time and enjoyed staying there.  Would definitely stay there again if we are ever in Boston"
1197857,8019437,2013-10-13,6047542,Daniel,"This apartment worked well for us. We were attending a conference, so the location was ideal, and it was clean, with everything (WiFi, appliances) working. The place is small, but for a couple, or two friends who don't mind the living room being taken up with the folded down sofa bed, it's fine. Would definitely recommend it. Will supplied us with all the necessary information, so check in and check out were simple processes."
1197857,8373961,2013-10-28,8127911,Rachel,"Overall a very good experience: very clean, well equipped apartment; comfortable bed; good shower; new, modern appliances; washer and dryer in basement. Availability of items like hairdryer and coffee machine was a plus (would have been nice if coffee was provided too)."
Location is quite good for South End,close to Mass. Avenue on the orange T line and with the silver line bus to downtown and South Station on the corner of Mass. Avenue and Washington Street also close by. Some good restaurants nearby (tried Orinoco and El Centro,both on Shawmut Ave.),,,
The whole building is made up of apartments rented out in this way,and access is by code,which makes things convenient as there's no need to arrange a meetup with the owner.,,,
Only major warning: be aware that Tremont is a busy street and the traffic noise is really quite loud in the apartment even overnight,"so if you're a light sleeper ear plugs are recommended.\"",,,,
1197857,8776313,2013-11-17,7546654,Vicki,Booked at really short notice but everything was easy and smooth.
The apartment looks exactly as in the pictures and is clean and tidy,I was visiting alone but it'd be a perfect size for 2.,,,,
Wifi was a bit patchy at times and slow but great when it worked.,,,,,
Would've been nice to have some basic supplies like tea and coffee but I understand why some people don't leave them in a kitchen.,,,,,
"Would definitely return and recommend. \"",,,,,
1197857,9101521,2013-12-07,1968965,Benjamin,"The apartment was very comfortable and the location worked out well, as we were needing to be near North Eastern University. Beware the walkup, it's long!"
1197857,10094845,2014-01-30,11264334,Jordan,Overall experience was great! Location and apartment are fantastic and Will was very responsive.
1197857,13133777,2014-05-20,9307214,Jesse,"Very nice apartment, and the immediate neighborhood is very nice as well.  Loved the keyless entry, everything is opened by keypads on the doors, very convenient.  Will was available when I called him on my way into town to make sure I was all set up."
The set up of the apt could use some work.  If the TV and the couch were swapped it would flow a lot better,as the couch being on that side of the room really closes off the living room.  For the first two days I was kicking the couch or the table every time I entered the room.  Since I didn't use the TV anyway,I actually moved the couch to the other side of the room where it fit nicely into a nook and it really opened it up!  Counter/cabinet space is also an issue,if you are staying longer term,don't plan on buying groceries that go into the cabinets.,
Make sure you keep your head about you,as a few blocks over it does get kinda dicey.  I never had an issue,"but spoke with many people locally who all said \"\"don't go that way.\"\"  I will restate",I did not have an issue with safety,but thought it was worth noting.,
Location is convenient,walking up Tremont is great for restaurants,Estelle's and  Parish are both right down stairs and have great beer selections,"as well as a great staff.  Mass Ave is also a nice walk to get down to Newbury St. or the Copley area.  I was here for two and a half weeks and it was ideal for me (besides the cabinet space).  I'd definitely stay here again!  \"",,
1197857,13651103,2014-06-02,11230372,Jo,"We had a lovely stay in this apartment.  South End is a great location as you can walk to lots of central areas including Copley Square and the main shopping streets. Or the T line stop is just down the road, plus there are buses to Cambridge that go from right outside (the number 1).  There are loads of nice places to eat and we fell in love with the Flour bakery."
Will was very helpful in advance of our visit,and provided a travel cot (pack and play) for our little boy to use.,,,,
The apartment itself had everything we needed,with a nice well equipped kitchen that meant we could cook a few simple meals with no hassle.  The rooms are all a good size and there's a nice view of the Piano Factory over breakfast.,,,,
The apartment is on quite a busy junction,with a gas station right opposite,so it is quite noisy and also bright at night.  We found it OK with the windows closed (there is air conditioning) but we were on the top floor - I think the lower floors are probably really quite noisy.  Saying that,we didn't hear a peep out of any other neighbours so it was quiet inside the building!,,
We used the laundry room which was really useful and easy.,,,,,
"Thanks Will!  We've recommended your place to our Boston-based friends to suggest to other visitors in the future!\"",,,,,
1197857,15049015,2014-07-01,3724571,Alejandra,The reservation was canceled 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The apartment is a lot smaller than it looks in the pictures, however is clean and tidy. The location isn't the best in Boston and not as close to downtown as I thought. The neighborhood is up and coming and still has some desirable characters around. The noise was a little excessive as its on a main road and close to a building being renovated next door."
1197857,16082129,2014-07-22,7953294,Karina,In a class of its own. Great place. Very modern apartment.  Close to everything. In walking distance of town-center.  We recommend this place to others
1197857,18171188,2014-08-23,2064324,Lennie,"Small but nice apartment. Check-in went very easy (I was e-mailed the access codes a couple of days before our arrival) and we were allowed to leave our luggage in the building after check-out, which was a big plus. Close to public transport (bus stops across the street and two metro lines are a 5-minute walk). Bars/restaurants downstairs and a lot more up Tremont street (10-minute walk). Only big downside: the noise. The apartment is on a big intersection and it appears that nothing is done to cancel out the noise from outside. I was able to fall asleep with earplugs and the traffic noise dies down late at night but we weren't able to sleep later than 7AM due to traffic and construction noise. It didn't ruin our stay but I wouldn't have chosen the apartment if I had known."
1197857,18367388,2014-08-25,6291327,Ali,Great apartment. Everything was kept in excellent form. Superb location. Easy access. Couldnt have asked anything more from a host.

So I myself cannot comment on the comfort of the beds, but the feedback from them was all great and they really loved the place and its wonderful location. I will definitly recommend this place again for out of town guests."

The owner provided fresh sheets, pillows, towels, an iron, a hair dryer and a coffee maker.  Also, he left us a notebook of all the various things to do in the neighborhood and their proximity to the apartment.  The neighborhood was great, but the apartment is on a busy street.  It could be troublesome for light sleepers.  However, it was close to a ton of nice restaurants, coffee shops and parks.  We were abIe to rent bicycles around the corner from the house and tour the city.  That was awesome!  Boston is a great city to tour by bike.  It's flat and easy to get around.  All in all this was a great apartment and would recommend this to anyone."

1197857,30140910,2015-04-18,25138503,Ross,"My first airbnb experience.   This is a small apartment building, very central and convenient, tastefully remodeled, and at a very fair rate.  Easy walking distance to the Common, Freedom Trail, Fenway Park and more.  Excellent laundry machines in the basement, which was an unexpected plus.  Well-equipped kitchen ... except for the lack of a fullsize frypan.  No contact with the host, but this was not a problem."
On the  downside: This place works only for a couple.  The sofabed is not usable.  We were three people - grampa,dad and 8-yr-old son. so Grampa slept on the floor.   Should not be rented to any more than two people.,,,,
The stairs are steep and narrow.  Worked ok for a 67-year-old grampa,but be prepared for a climb.,,,,

It was very clean and bright inside, apartment and house in very good condition there even was a walk in closet for the luggage. Easy access via code made the arrival and departure an easy act."
The only problem we met upon arrival was a lack of towels and difficulty with air mattresse,which both were fixed the very same day. Our apartment was on 3rd level which was a good and appreciated exercise for us but perhaps not for those with reduced mobility.  Neighborhood is great and we felt safe. A nearby Hubway station made it easy for us to cycle to nearest attractions,shops and restaurants.,,,
"Highly recommend!\"",,,,,
1197857,33495153,2015-05-29,23302437,Kim,"A very modern, bright, and airy flat. It was really well equipped and had everything we needed to make it a 'home' to go back to after exploring Boston. The entry code system made checking in so simple and meant you didn't have to remember a key. A great location as it's close to the T station making it convenient to get around Boston. Quite a few places to eat nearby though my favourite has got to be Giacomo's. Massive portions of amazing pasta. Two of the six nights we stayed there were loud 'pops' outside around 2am which sounded like gun shots but coming back after dark and walking around during the day felt absolutely safe and I'd never have believed it could happen in the area. I'm half hoping for an alternative explanation or that I imagined it! Regardless I'd definitely stay there again if I was coming back to Boston. Thanks for a brilliant stay."
1197857,33829826,2015-06-01,19253390,Lauren,The apartment was perfect! Super clean with everything we could want or need! Wifi and TV worked with no problems! The location was ideal- easy access to great South End restaurants and a short walk to Back Bay or Fenway! I would definitely recommend this place for a stay in Boston!
1197857,34860585,2015-06-13,30609237,Betsy,"The apartment was very welcoming! Easy to find, easy to get in and the neighborhood is a great location! The posting is very accurate! It fits 4 if you want 2 to the bed in the bedroom and 2 on the pull out couch. It's a little tight, but just enough space to go back to at the end of the day to sleep. My only complaint is that we only had 3 bath towels for the 4 of us. And only one kitchen towel, but we made it work. Other reviews were on spot with the noise, so be sure to bring earplugs. Thanks for a wonderful and easy stay!"
1197857,35217536,2015-06-16,8424730,Ed,"The booking process and follow through could not have been smoother.  Booking confirmation within hours of inquiry and contract followed close behind.  A few days before our scheduled arrival, we received the digital entry codes into the building and specific unit along with local contact info if we needed anything and WI-FI passwords.  The unit was clean and had everything we needed for our 3 day stay.  Very minor things, a few burned out light bulbs here and there did not impact our stay.  The building has been renovated, but there are a few things you should make note of -- this building is located at a busy intersection within a true urban area, so there is outside noise.  The area felt safe.  We walked through the surrounding neighborhood during both the daytime and evening.  A number of restaurants and other business nearby.  We also visited the Museum of Fine Arts which is an easy walk, which we greatly enjoyed.  Whole foods and smaller convenience stores are within easy walking distance.  The pictures provided are an accurate portrayal of the apartment . . . it's small, but good light and perfect for a couple.  Another couple mentioned their review they shared the unit with another couple -- obviously doable, but a little too cozy in my opinion.  If we were headed back to Boston and needed lodging in the South End, I would most certainly rent here again."
1197857,36699301,2015-06-30,34745290,Kimberly,"yes we felt welcome, liked the codes to get into the doors instead of keys, described just like it was"
we enjoyed our stay,"we would stay there again\"",,,,
1197857,38707157,2015-07-18,5844570,Lace,"This South Side apartment is great for walkers - an easy 2-4 blocks to 2 T-lines (subway), a Whole Foods, a Trader Joe's, & CVS. In addition, several hospitals. Situated in a residential neighborhood,  there's a cute jazz club (Wally's) that you MUST go to for Latin Jazz night. The apt is a true-2 person, modern, compact & cozy spot. It's great to come back to after a long day out and rest/sleep. Not much room for visitors or children. The pullout couch has a worn/unusable mattress. The airmattress was an acceptable substitution. Although it is a variable the host may have no control over, the neighborhood gets noisy at night. I would invest in double-pane glass windows as to not deter future reservations. With that exception, I would stay here again."
1197857,39740771,2015-07-26,29755778,Ryan,The place was great. Very clean and easy check in and out. Very accessible and walkable to the majority of the city. We loved it.

1197857,41328741,2015-08-07,31289600,Robin,"The unit was very neat and clean, with clever uses of space, and clear directions for guests.  Location was great for us, as our friends lived nearby and transportation was very accessible. Plus restaurants nearby were fabulous.  It is on a big noisy intersection, and despite reassurances, we had to use earplugs to sleep because of the sirens and car stereo noises. (and we are used to city noise!) But it was quite a comfortable room.  We had no direct contact with the host when we arrived. When we left a request for an air mattress that didn't leak our first night there, they left one in the unit the next day.   The air mattress on the floor worked great as a secondary sleeping area once it arrived.  It is a perfect unit for two people, perhaps three, but four (two adults and two kids) was doable but tight."
1197857,41484671,2015-08-07,5991821,Stephanie,"The apartment in Boston was just as described. Easy to find, well located, very clean, and nicely decorated.

1197857,44628742,2015-08-28,606077,Michelle,"Apartment was great - clean, well situated, easy to find. I would definitely stay here again! Only complaint would be that the windows don't block out any noise from the street, so be prepared with some earplugs."
1197857,45571369,2015-09-04,29800956,Kristy,"Will's apartment was exactly as described. Perfect location, just a few blocks from the T. Loved the keyless entry. We did NOT find our apartment to be noisy from traffic, although we were on the 6th floor. I would recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Boston!"
1197857,47150310,2015-09-16,36266233,Sonia,Everything was as described. The apartment is very clean an good located. We received prompt reply to any question. We had a great time in Boston and can highly recommend the apartment.
1197857,47360030,2015-09-18,23654292,Laurent,The apartment was clean and well equipped but it's a bit far from downtown.
We had some inconveniences but staff was very reactive to our concerns.,,,,,
The place is not managed by a private individual but by a company,"so it's not very \"\"airbnb spirit\"\" and it's very impersonal.",,,,
Nevertheless,"it's a good place to stay.\"",,,,

It was well furnished and the access was convenient with a code to enter the common space and the apartment itself.,,,,,
It is well located and you can access all Boston areas from there.,,,,,
The only limitation from our point of view was the departure. As the flat is not run by will itself but belongs to its business,it is not flexible concerning the storage of luggage,and you can not discuss it with him like we always did with real host in our former stays in AirBnb flats.,,,

I would absolutely recommend this and stay there again."
1197857,54715203,2015-11-23,20238140,Mike,"Will's place was exactly as advertised, very clean, and very nice.  Worked very well for the 4 of us.  You could potentially fit 5 if you had 2 couples and 1 for the couch, but no more than that.  Might be a tough climb to Unit #6 for anyone with mobility issues."

Everything from the kitchen supplies to the shower and the bed were high quality. Buses and subway nearby. Not to mention tons of amazing south end restaurants. Highly recommended.
1197857,66156955,2016-03-20,49348259,Jason,"The host made me feel very welcome and the check-in was very easy since the building and apartment have keypad entry. The apartment is very close to the Orange, Green and Silver Lines making getting around Boston simple.  It is also on the #1 bus route which goes directly to MIT and Harvard.  The laundry in the basement was free and easy to use and the Wifi was very fast. The only three cons to the apartment are: (1) that the street it is on is quite noisy because of the traffic; (2) it is located on the third floor which requires climbing two sets of steep stairs; (3) the apartment is very bright with a skylight in the living room and large bedroom windows which can make it hard to sleep in.  But even with these in mind, I would definitely stay there again."
1197857,67181789,2016-03-27,31249411,Sasha,"Very cozy 1 bedroom type apartment, even the staircase up was lovely. I liked that we had the privacy and basic accommodations of a hotel, but still felt like we were staying with someone living in Boston."

Ci ha inviato i codici per accedere alla porta principale e dell'appartamento. Appartamento accogliente e pulito e con tutto il necessario. L'unica pecca e che essendo al 3 piano quando arrivi con le valigie si fa fatica a salire avendo scale ripide. Comodo alla metro e per chi vuole anche a piedi ci vogliono 15 min per il centro. Supermercato e ristoranti vicini. Ci siamo trovati bene!! Grazie"

We got lucky for the first two nights and found parking in front of the building.  On the third night, we have to park in a public parking across street which costed 30 dollars a night."

The description and the pictures were accurate, however a key detail that was missing was that the bathroom that was in the hallway had to be shared with other residents staying next door. In our case 4+3, total of 7 had to share 1 bathroom. Street  parking was free, although was not readily available on the same street. Very often, we had to park 2-3 blocks away.

We did not get our instructions how to get the keys before we arrived, and when we arrived, there was nobody there to let us in. We were standing there on the street with our suitcases, trying to reach the host, which we couldn't at first. Finally he sent us a code for the keybox, which he should have done in advance. It was very hard to communicate with him."

They had welcome snacks and beverages ready for us laid out with the flair of a fine hotel.  They treated us like old friends, chatting and visiting but retreating to allow private time to enjoy the deck and sun.  Our breakfast was ready when we woke, delicious and plentiful.

I could go on about how clean the boat is (very) or how close it is to much of what Boston has to offer. But what really made our stay were all of the thoughtful touches that made us feel special - how we were welcomed, the mini floral arrangements, how our cabin was set up and ready for us, coffee and hot breakfast in the morning. An FYI for those who rarely go on the water - even while docked, the boat will have a subtle movement from time to time. I only mention this for those who might be extremely sensitive because it's barely noticeable. No surprise here - we hope to stay with Terry & Chris again."

Booking communication was promot and informative.  Arrival was seamless and gracious as we were greeted by Terry who walked us from our car to the yacht and had  refreshments waiting for us aboard.  We had a wonderful visit with Terry and CJ who provided us with great information about how to best navigate the city, key points of interest within walking distance, and recommendations for dining that proved to be outstanding!   Our cabin was immaculate, as was the entire yacht.  Comfortable bedding and amenties in both the cabin and bath made us feel right at home with a little extra pampering.  We were pleasantly surprised to have a lovely breakfast waiting for us each morning and only wished we had more time to spend with these great guys.  We own and operate 6 vacation rentals and list on this site.  For 3 years we have searched various vacation rental sites for accomadations while embracing the paradigm shift in lodging.  This is the FIRST one we actually booked.  Terry and CJ have set the mark high and we really appreciated being able to enjoy their efforts in making their  home available for us to enjoy.

4304969,23795029,2014-12-10,7173715,Cory,Gene was an amazing host! Very responsive. The apartment is located right in the heart of the North End next to Hanover St. Perfect location to walk around Bostons little Italy and easy access to the MBTA.

4304969,25290995,2015-01-11,24480929,Nicolas,"L'appartement est spacieux, en très bon état, très bien équipé (cuisine, serviettes de toilette, etc.), il est situé dans un quartier animé, avec beaucoup de restaurants et à une courte distance du métro."
C'est également très calme et la literie est de qualité.,,,,,
Le seul petit défaut est qu'il est au rez-de-chaussée,"au fond d'un long couloir entre deux immeubles et ne reçoit donc que peu de lumière malgré des fenêtres dans chaque pièce.\"",,,,
4304969,25472385,2015-01-17,5671666,Ashley,"My friend and I stay at Gene's place while we were in town for job interviews and loved it! It is a cozy little place to come home to after a long day. The location couldn't be more perfect for all that the North End has to offer, as well as, only about a 7 minute walk to Haymarket Station. Gene was also very pleasant to correspond to over the course of our weeks trip, and always available if necessary. I would definitely stay at his place again if the situation ever arose!"
4304969,28294510,2015-03-21,29660089,Sharon,The reservation was canceled 372 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4304969,30138955,2015-04-18,28373596,Camila,"The apartment was very good and clean. It was just like the pictures: modern, with complete appliances (hair dryer, iron, AC, heat, oven, TV, cable, wi-fi, etc), contemporary furniture and design objects. Although the apartment itself was excelent, another amazing feature is the location, which is in a touristic neighborhood, next to several great italian restaurants, 24/7 convenience stores and bakery."
Finally,I would like to compliment the host,Mr. Gene,that kept me updated with any information that I was suppose to know. We had a little misunderstanding on my arrival,but Gene,knowing the time that I was going to arrive there
4304969,30581803,2015-04-24,18949688,Jeffrey,"Perfect location in the North End. Complete quiet -- I didn't hear the slightest noise from the street or neighbors. Easy access to the front door key, even after my delayed flight got me there at 1:30 AM. Gene checked in on me to make sure everything was all right, which it was, in every detail."
4304969,31094782,2015-05-02,26294652,Steve,This was the perfect fit for my husband and I in Boston's North End! The apartment was clean and conveniently located. Gene was available when we contacted him upon arrival and even checked in on us by phone during our stay. This is our first Airbnb and we loved it!
4304969,31602765,2015-05-07,17744661,Ellen,"My husband and I had a great time staying at Gene's place!  The apartment perfectly located in North End, right near the Freedom trail and amongst many fantastic Italian restaurants.  Gene wasn't there to greet us personally, though his instructions on gaining access to his apartment were abundantly clear and made our arrival a very smooth process!  Once we were settled, Gene was great at providing suggestions for restaurants, bars and things to see and do in the area, and checked in with us via email to see how we were going which was great."
"I would highly recommend staying here for anyone who is wanting to gain an authentic Boston experience - I will be sure to when I am next in town!\"",,,,,
4304969,32228652,2015-05-16,25558298,Sean,"Gene was a great guy, left water in the fridge for us, went and bought a coffee maker/coffee when he found out we like coffee. Told us repeatedly if we needed anything to let him know. Would definitely stay here again, being in the north end was a great location. My wife liked the painting so much I think we're getting one just like it."
4304969,32500859,2015-05-19,27279887,Jeff,Great location for food and history. Apartment was perfect size and had everything we needed. Parking was 34 dollars a day at pilgrim but if you don't need to travel far(Waltham) don't bother with a car.
"Gene's place is about 2 blocks from Paul Revere's house and you'll be walking across the freedom trail multiple times a day. Couldn't have found a better spot to see Boston.\"",,,,,

4304969,33563087,2015-05-30,25159336,Juergen,"My wife and I spent a week in Gene's apartment. We found everything we needed to feel well, the apt is quiet and fully equipped. The surrounding is absolutely picturesque and an ideal basis for a Boston visit. All kinds of services (laundry etc.) and restaurants available. Gene kept close contact and did everything to ensure uncomplicated check-in and check-out. A good experience!"
4304969,34042457,2015-06-03,3528262,John,Great Stay! Highly recommend Gene. Really nice guy. I'd prefer dealing with him than a hotel any day. It was also very clean.
4304969,34276895,2015-06-07,11038160,Laree,"Great experience all around. Super clean and cozy apartment - perfect for the two of us. Every thing is as it looks in the photos - floors were clean. Exceptionally quiet - had no trouble sleeping. Towels and linens smelled freshly washed. Everything you could need to cook in a kitchen, but why would you want to when so many amazing restaurants are right out your door in this location? Minutes away from everything in Boston - including train stops. Easy to access everything you could want to do from this location."
4304969,34711529,2015-06-11,32350448,Cait,"The only issue I had with the place, was that I wasn't able to stay longer.  It is a cozy little spot with modern comforts and perfect for my stay.  I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I should've as I was only home to sleep and shower.  Gene kept perfect contact with me and was so accommodating to all my needs as well.  This was my first time using Air BnB and it was such a success! Can't wait to try it out in other cities and visit Gene's Downtown Designer Digs on my next visit to Boston! Nothing better than strolling through the North End, feeling like your waltzing through the streets of Florence but right here in the US! Thanks for everything Gene!!"
4304969,34979123,2015-06-14,33244712,Allison,This was my first air bnb experience and it was great. Gene was easy to work with and very helpful. The apartment was exactly as advertised - clean modern and quiet in the heart of the North end. Great place to stay for a Boston visit.

4304969,36110369,2015-06-25,24423717,Beth,Ideal location in the North End. So many awesome destinations within walking distance! Also easy access to the Subway.

Highlights of our visit - Freedom Trail tour (with State Parks Ranger),Cannoli from Modern Pastry (Mike's gets all the love!),Improv Asylum (comedy),Parla cafe/wine bar,Samuel Adams Brewery tour ... too many to list here!,
"We'd stay here again. \"",,,,,
4304969,36783616,2015-07-01,33238810,Jacey,"It was very easy to be in contact with Gene, both before and during my stay. Although the need didn't arise, it was good to know just in case... If you like being in the thick of things, you cannot beat this location or this apartment. Being in the North End was very convenient to everything in the city, and it doesn't take long before you feel like a local. The apartment is perfect. It's small so I wouldn't recommend any more than 3 people (2 in the bedroom and one on the fold-down couch) but it's very clean and accommodating. It's also in the back of the building so even though it's on a somewhat busy street, the apartment is very quiet. The a/c is excellent, as is the internet. And it's very safe! This is an excellent choice for a vacation rental!"
4304969,37209601,2015-07-05,4591827,Amy,The apartment is in a great location - very close to everything on Hanover Street and Salem Street.  It's also very clean and comfortable. We had a great time and highly recommend Gene's apartment!
4304969,37763885,2015-07-10,2708815,Thuy-Lan,"Gene is super fast and responsive. The apt is in a good location with lots of restaurants - very touristy so if you like that, its awesome. It is not noisy and i had a nice stay. The only thing that might have been good to know before hand is that the apt is quite closed with closed windows and i needed to circulate the air by turning on a/c."
4304969,37973419,2015-07-12,15618629,David,"My fiancé and I had a wonderful stay.  The apartment is in a great location in the North End of Boston.  It's surrounded by amazing restaurants and historical sites of interest.  The bed was amazing comfortable and the air conditioners offered much relief from the heat.  As the pictures show, the apartment is tastefully decorated.  We would definitely stay again on our next visit."

It's in a lively, interesting neighbourhood but because it's set back from the street, it was quiet inside. Very convenient and well placed for sight seeing and eating out. We'd absolutely recommend it."

The apartment had everything we could need and the location was the best!  Easy access to the rest of Boston and so much to do (and mostly eat) right outside the door.  We will be back!
4304969,41953187,2015-08-10,35010721,Julie,James was so easy to work with! Perfect little apartment in an ideal location in Little Italy/north end. Super walkable area near lots of great sights and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again on a return trip!

4304969,44033655,2015-08-23,2578015,Juliana,"We had a wonderful experience with James and his place. He warmly greeted us as soon as we were accepted. A day before our stay, he reached out and gave us all the details on where to find the key and made himself available to any questions we had. We didn't arrive until late, and he still made sure we got in ok. The place was perfect for the two of us. Clean, safe, and in a great location. It is in the heart of the Italian district of North end, so we were surrounded by food, cafes, and history. The place had everything we needed for our stay in Boston. We highly recommend and will stay here again!"
4304969,44191580,2015-08-24,19584805,Johnny,Although we never met the host communicated well with us and sent directions via email and text message for the unit. The listing is as pictured.

4304969,49010040,2015-09-30,41180340,Lex,Our host made us feel welcome. He had to come over to the apartment to help with the WiFi as the router seemed to be having a problem. We also needed bath soap and paper towels which he quickly provided.
This apartment is in a very convenient neighborhood in north Boston. We loved the Italian restaurants and bakeries and the ability to walk to many historic sights. Thanks James for renting us a great place.,,,,,

We LOVED the neighborhood! Great restaurants,walking distance to almost everything (and a quick,convenient subway trip to anything farther away.) We felt very safe walking around.,,,

The apartment is perfect for two ppl, maybe 4 too, if you don't stay that long and only come to crash. It is clean, comfortable and very, very quite. You can sleep until late, need be, because it's dark, as the windows face a small brick niche. The bed is super comfortable. You have everything you need (dishes, silver, towels, toaster, coffee machine, microwave, stove). The location is awesome, in the heart of the best neighbourhood in Boston - North End. Walking distance to Quince Market, Faneuil Hall, TD Garden, the Aquarium, the T/ underground (green, orange and blue liner) and a million restaurants and pizzerias (check Regina, 5mins away!!!) and pubs catering to all tastes' and wishes (there's even a Sushi place around the corner)."
James was great,not bothering you for no reason but prompt in answering messages and fixing problems if the case - like the bathroom sink wouldn't drain when we got there; we sent him a msg b4 going out and when we got back it's bn fixed already.,,,,
So great place,great host. Highly recommend!,,,,

Everything in the property was nice and clean. We didn't meet James in person, but he checked in a few times to make sure we made it to the property and checked in again halfway through our stay. I would recommend James' place to others and would want to stay here again when we come back in the summer!"

The neighborhood was super-nice: you get a chance to experience inside of Little Italy not only in the evening with the rest of the tourists, but also early in the morning when local Padres are drinking their coffee) It also gives you a chance to sneak into famous Mike's Bakery around the corner and try local cannoli early in the morning before masses of sugar-fans arrive) The apartment was just as described in the add - modern, well thought through and pleasant to stay in. The only downside is the lack of direct sunlight (there is only a light shaft, where the windows are located), so it's not exactly perfect for hanging out. Rather than that, it's a great place to come back 'home to' after a long day of new experiences ))"
4304969,63936261,2016-02-28,54809774,Edward,"You cannot ask for a better location in Boston to explore the city.  My wife and I both love to visit a 'walking city', and Boston was exceptionally great in that regard.  Most locations we wished to see were within a couple of miles, and many were only a couple of blocks away -- walking the Freedom Trail, visiting old churches and graveyards, seeing the USS Constitution, having a few drinks at a local pub, dining on great Italian food, sushi from the North End Fish Market, and Mike's Pastry (one has to try their connoli!)."
On the evening of our arrival,James got in touch with us to make sure that everything was OK and to call him if anything was not to our liking.   Everything was fine and we did not need any assistance from him during our stay,,,,
"This was our first time using AirBnB.  We will definitely try to stay at Mike's abode again.  We love Boston!\"",,,,,
4304969,64623943,2016-03-06,56708665,Sharon,"Our host quickly responded to our calls when needing additional information. The space could not have been cleaner....loved that! The bed was extremely comfortable, and quality linens. Well equipped kitchen, but not really used as there were so many amazing restaurants within 2 blocks. Busy fun neighborhood, but apartment is tucked back in and very quiet. Highly recommend!"
4304969,65065972,2016-03-10,59855220,Andrea,"The area of the apartment is really nice, in the middle of Little italy - a lot of nice Restaurants and Cafes around. Easy to reach and really central! The Apartment is super nice, modern and cozy - definitely a place I would always come back!"
4304969,65187817,2016-03-11,57491866,Maureen,"James was an excellent host and the apartment was exactly as listed. It's beautifully appointed and very comfortable. The location in the North End is perfect for walking to restaurants, coffee and sightseeing but was also secluded and quiet at night. I would definitely stay here again."
4304969,65275153,2016-03-12,61241530,Allison,Great place and amazing location. Tons of restaurants and cafes just down the street. An easy walk to any of the Boston sights.
4304969,66394152,2016-03-22,33714628,Sibyl,"We never met James but he was really good at communicating during our stay. We stayed for a longer period for both work and holiday, which made the location ideal - it's 5 mins from the T stop/the public market and within walking distance of countless bakeries including the famous Mike's Pastry as well as a 24hour one. It's also one street away from the 'freedom trail'!"
The flat is really nicely furnished,quiet and the bed and linen is extremely comfortable. We appreciated the kitchen area and cupboard space. The only downside is the lack of natural light (there is three windows but the light doesn't really reach),which can't really be helped with the location,"but we did feel it sometimes if we were in for more than a couple of hours during the day (especially since some lightbulbs were out too for a few days). It's not a major issue though as we were mainly out during the day and it does keep the flat well insulated and warm. Overall we had an excellent and comfortable stay and would highly recommend it. \"",,
4304969,67173166,2016-03-27,50921828,Dave,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and James made it a good one.  He was very good about communicating with us, making sure we go in alright, and that we had what we needed."
The place was exactly what we expected,from the posting,and the neighborhood was great.  We felt like we were wandering in and out of Italy.,,,
We will definitely stay again,"next time we are in Boston.\"",,,,

The T was great and made it easy to get to the North End.  Everything was SUPER clean, and James made sure to confirm that things went smoothly.  Would be happy to stay again!"
4304969,68765201,2016-04-06,6024436,Joel,"Sweet apartment in one of Boston's neighborhood gems: the walking is great.  James is an extremely solicitous host.  Sometime minor problems can't be helped (like a burned out bulb), and he went the extra mile to make my stay as comfortable as possible.  Highly recommend."
4304969,69634684,2016-04-12,39343765,Evan,"Highly recommend staying here if you are planning a trip to Boston. The apartment was a perfect size for my wife and I, very comfortable and in an amazing location. Near all the best restaurants and shops in the North End. A short walk to historic landmarks, parks and public transportation. Very safe walkable neighborhood day and night. James was a perfect host. Provided us with all the information we needed to make our stay extremely enjoyable. Can't wait to stay here again."

We walked everywhere, saw many sights- so much interesting history, and ate at delicious restaurants. Panza (right around the corner) was probably our favorite!"
4304969,72476079,2016-05-02,56191987,Amy,"Such a great place to stay!!! I highly recommend it!  Super clean and exactly as it was described.  Right in the heart of the North End, quick walk to Quincy Market, right on the Freedom Trail, 20 minutes from Boston Common.  We were so sad to leave.  James was great!  He gave full accurate directions on how to check in and made sure throughout our trip that everything was going great.  If we ever go back we would surely stay there!"
4304969,72857168,2016-05-05,57260550,Elizabeth,James' communication was speedy and very helpful. Everything about the stay was exactly as expected.
We adored the neighborhood and walked to everything--the aquarium,Boston Common,the Freedom Trail. Excellent location.,,,
Had there been any sunshine during our stay AND had we spent much daytime in the apt,the view of the brick wall may have bothered us (maybe) but as we mostly just relaxed in the evening and slept,it was no problem at all. It really is a cove,"with a cool tunnel entrance.\"",,
4304969,74035155,2016-05-12,33655093,Lucas,"This was our first experience on Airbnb, and our first international trip with my wife. We are delighted with what we have chosen. James was an exceptional host, always there for us although we didnt get to meet him personally. Location was a 10, surrounded by italian restaurants, close to the TD Garden and the train station, the apartment was almost perfect and pretty cozy, a tv in the living room would have made it superlative. The only difficulty was knowing how to enter the apartment, since we had a 13 hr flight from argentina and we werent able to get the instructions that same day. We had to stay at the caffee on the corner to get them."
Other than that,"loved the city and james did a big part on that.\"",,,,

James was very accommodating, and responded in a timely manner when we contacted him. We had no trouble finding the place or the lockbox due to good directions. It was a quiet place and very convenient to everything. Thanks so much!!"

4304969,77113010,2016-05-30,6440866,Kim,"Easy arrival, great location and beautiful apt.  Very quiet area and apt.  There are several other apts in the building but you would never know it.  You don't hear the people above you and there isn't anyone next to you.  Everything you would need is in the apt and James is very reachable if you need him.  I can't wait to go back."

I exercised by running by the water and on a baseball field very nearby. It also is in the heart of Boston's North End which unfortunately I didn't get to enjoy. It would be a great place to have city get-away smack dab in the middle of a great neighborhood. Next time!"
4304969,78396472,2016-06-06,63866466,Qiming,"The apt is very cozy, clean and convenient. And I love the neighborhood very much,it's very quiet at night and only 5 min's walk to subway station(which has green and orange line). I didn't see James, but he is very helpful and easy to reach. This is the first time I use Airbnb, and have a good experience."

His apartment was as described in the listing and very clean ... and James was quite accessible, as needed.  Our preference would have been for an apartment with more natural light, but most of our time was spent away from the apartment so that was a minor issue.  All in all, it was a great experience and James was a great host."
4304969,79985271,2016-06-15,29187082,Misti,Wish we had more time! We flew into Boston for a quick night before heading to NH for a wedding. This place was perfect. The location was amazing and allowed us to walk to great restaurants and sight see. James was great and checked in on us to make sure everything was good and see if we had any questions. Would definitely go back.

You must get a cannoli on Hanover Street! The bed was very comfortable, the tv was a nice relaxing touch at the end of a long day, and it was convenient to have a kitchen for our leftovers. And we were very thankful for the AC on the hot Boston days!"
4304969,84323608,2016-07-06,35967197,Katherine,"James' place was in the heart of the North end, and a great Boston location.

It is so tucked in and quiet but again step out of the apt and you are where everyone wants to be. I stayed here for 5 days and my mother came up from the cape for 2 of those days to stay with me. We were there for the Fishermans Festivial- highly recommend this seafood fest in the North End.. James communication, though I did not get to meet him,  was  fast, quick and caring. He made sure I got in OK and again checked  in with me that everything went well as I left.  I rate James place 5 stars--Location-Location-Location and Communication!!!!"

7292184,95635496,2016-08-20,55330954,Kay,"Mounir was helpful to help me check in. His place is quiet, 10 minute to grocery, 5 minute to DLR station and it takes less than 20 minutes to get Canary Wharf. The room is small but clean. Plus I had access to the kitchen. The only drawback was that the trash was full when I arrived, probably it was because that Mounir was away. But his roommate handled the trash once I contacted Mounir. Overall the price is unbeatable and I would recommend the place to others."

The room was impeccably clean and comfortable, and I had a nice time staying there.  The neighborhood was very quiet, and although it was a little further from the train stop than I thought it would be, it was still within walking distance."
7292184,99080847,2016-09-03,18760624,Frank,"Mounir is a very nice host, the place is warm, and he is very flexible to my request when I found out my daughter  need spent one night with me when she needed move out on 8/31."

The room was private with a comfortable bed. With our short stay we didn't make use of the kitchen which she made fully available to us, even the food! We walked to and from the airport which was close and the neighborhood felt very safe and quiet. Even though it was close to the airport, we heard no noise from planes. Lana communicated well with us before our arrival with quick responses to our questions. She met us at the door to let us in and was even kind enough to walk us to the harbor and give great information. We will have to come back to Boston to really enjoy the beauty of this city."

Her house is located in a great location.  You can walk to the Blue Line from her place with takes you to downtown Boston.  You can also walk to the Silver Line at the airport,which will take you to South Boston.  If you flying into Boston,I would recommend that you take the taxi to her place,as the exit for pedestrians is difficult to find.  The taxi is about 10$US.,,
The bedroom is a decent size.  The bed is a good size,enough room for two people. Pillows are soft,not my personal preference but I had a comfortable sleep. The bedroom has an A/C unit,which cools the room quickly.  On the dresser,there are multiple flyers and maps of activities in Boston,which helped us get around.

"From the apartment it's a nice 10-15 min walk to Copley square or there's public transportation to most parts of Boston. I recommend this apartment.\"",,,,,

The kitchen had all the essentials & there were even a few items in the refrigerator & cabinets for cooking. The location was perfect with many restaurants & shops. Everything I needed was within walking distance. It was easy to park & close the highway for commuting. Greg was a fantastic host. He communicated promptly and it was very easy to receive & drop off the keys. My puppy stayed with me as well & enjoyed the apartment & loved going on walks to the nearby dog park. I would highly recommend Greg's apartment & would love to stay again on my future work trips to Boston.
2326445,37335525,2015-07-06,9986734,Christy,"We had a great stay at Greg's condo.  It was as pictured in the listing -- very clean with a lot of natural light.  The bed was comfortable (and was a standard double bed - I know one reviewer said that it was small, but we found it to be the size of a regular bed).  Accessing the condo was a breeze.  Greg was very responsive to the few questions we had."

No problem whatsoever  Never having been to Boston it was an ideal location - only 10-15 walk along Washington Street got you to the T line and if you didn't want to walk the Silver line bus stop was located 30 seconds from the apartment - just steps away so perfect if you weren't inclined to walk ( we like to walk)  .Foodies (grocery store) is right around the corner so convenient!.   The apartment was clean and bright and I would definitely stay here again.  Thanks Gregory - we had a great time!
2326445,44925939,2015-08-30,14103359,Ryan,A great experience in the South End of Boston! Gregory was very hospitable and responded quickly to any questions I had. The apartment is gorgeous and very bright. Wonderful tub and a beautiful kitchen with a fantastic gas stove.

The condo has everything you need with a full kitchen, washer dryer, extra towels and linens, kitchen table for 4, flat screen TV , and wireless access. It's quiet so you can get a good night sleep while still being walking distance to some of the best restaurants in the city.  Also very convenient to foodies market, the new Ink Block Whole Foods, as well as the SOWA farmers market for those that plan on an extended stay and want access to grocery's. Overall a great value and awesome location."

2326445,50759927,2015-10-14,14242266,Alexandra,"Gregory's studio is a perfect place to explore Boston. We did most of it by foot, but public transportation is also just around the corner. So are several nice small cafes, bars and restaurants."
The apartment is small,but bright and clean and got all we needed for a few days stay. The only thing to remark is that the bed is relatively small for two tall persons,but I guess that's a matter of what you are used to. All arrangements and communication with Gregory were easy and smooth. He responded quickly to any question,"e.g. where to get a drink on the night of our arrival or where to rent bikes for the day. That made things easier for us. So all in all a good place to stay. I can definitely recommend it.\"",,

She said it was perfect for someone travelling alone or even for a couple. Gregory was easily accessible and quick to respond to any inquiries. If we are ever in Boston again I will surely be booking this apartment. Thank you Gregory!
2326445,53508518,2015-11-09,46707394,Kathleen,"This apartment is in such a good location. Having never been in Boston before, we were taking a little bit of a gamble in booking. But, this place really fit the bill. It is surrounded by great restaurants and coffee shops and it is an easy walk into downtown. The apartment was very clean when we arrived and finding the lockbox with the keys was simple because it is just down the street. Gregory was an attentive communicator and we had no issues!"
2326445,53750491,2015-11-12,1326890,Mari,One of the best we have ever stayed in . A real home from home in a great location and gregory was  an excellent host.

Easy key pick up
2326445,58442820,2016-01-02,16906909,Shannon,"Gregory was a wonderful host for a weekend in Boston. A busy one too - New Years! We never saw him, but he made sure me and my bf  had everything we needed by often communicating with us. The apartment was welcoming, clean, and had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here next time I am in the South end of Boston. We arrived late, so we couldn't find street parking. Instead, Gregory suggested a place for overnight parking that was close - $33/night, a good deal for the security you get. Thanks for a great stay, Gregory!"
2326445,59160612,2016-01-07,52172388,Hida,"Gregory's apartment was very welcoming, very clean,  with nice neighbor in a nice neighborhood. I will go back there  given the opportunity.

The studio is located in a slightly residential area but within walking distance from some nice trendy restaurants and pretty much everything and if you don't feel like walking there's a bus down the block.  Communicating with Gregory was very easy and he answered quickly.  To be honest we would love to move the studio to NYC to live, it's that great.  We would gladly stay there again."

2326445,78133952,2016-06-05,17532272,Sydney,Greg was a great host. He was easy to get in touch with and was very attentive to our needs.

In terms of location I doubt you can do better.  The apartment is easy walking distance to many South End restaurants and comfortable walking distance to the Museum of Fine Arts, downtown and even the Esplanade.  Also, it is less than a ten minute walk to Whole Foods which was a great resource during the stay.  The neighborhood is very quiet with little traffic noise.  Finally, for me, the apartment was worth booking just to enjoy the amazing winding staircase."

There was also great communication during our stay. Painters were going to be in the stairwell, and Gregory informed us well in advance so it wasn’t a surprise when we left the apartment. As for the apartment itself, it was clean and exactly as the pictures showed. The central air was a welcome relief during the heat wave. The neighborhood was fantastic, close to great restaurants and an easy walk to anywhere you would want to go. Overall, it was just a great experience."
2326445,90586541,2016-08-01,81676589,Anja,We arrived at a cosy and clean studio with all the things you may need supplied for us. The studio is in a top location and we walked everywhere. We went to some of the bakeries on Greg's guidebook and liked them a lot. We had a unforgettable time!
2326445,92219906,2016-08-08,58043694,Patrick,What a great little loft to stay in! So clean and welcoming. Gregory let us check in early due to our plane arriving so early in the morning.

Kristin's home was so welcoming and comfortable. Everything was spotless and she provided us with everything we could have needed.
Charlestown was spectacular! Very quiet and charming. The USS Constitution and USS Caussin Young were all of about a 4 minute walk away. Kristin's suggestion of visiting Pier 6 (which was even closer and only one of many suggested places to visit) was great,such a perfect place for an afternoon drink and bite to eat. Also a great neighborhood to go for a run in.,,,,
The ferry to downtown was also only a 5 minute walk away and came every 30 minutes during the week (Kristin also provided us with a ferry schedule). However,if it's a really nice day,you can walk right over the bridge into downtown in about 15-20 minutes.,,,

Kristin was very flexible with us checking in early and checking out late. She always responded right away to any questions.  The apartment was quite roomy with two huge tvs! The bed was great (we didn't even miss our own bed).
We loved the neighborhood because it is within walking distance of the north end/td garden/north station (less than a mile over the bridge ) but still a quiet place to come home to.  You can pick up the freedom trail right by the apartment,take the T ferry over to the aquarium/harbor/whale watches ($7 each round trip)  There is a convenience/grocery store a couple blocks away.,,,,

Everything is immaculate and I was beyond comfortable throughout my stay. The bed is great and I loved all of the natural light pouring into the entire space each morning. I was traveling alone so really appreciated the safety of the neighborhood and the security of the building. I didn't rent a car and was easily able to access public transportation within just a few minutes' walk.
Favorite places for food and drink were the Navy Yard Bistro and the Warren Tavern,both of which were easy walks. The Bistro is very close. The Tavern was a bit of a longer walk but such a pleasant one and a great way to get a feel for Charlestown.,,,,
"Kristin's communication leading up to my stay was spot on. She responded quickly every time. I loved that this continued during my stay. All of my questions (\"\"where are your dish towels?\"\") received a speedy response.",,,,,
Finally,I appreciated the thoughtful touches that speak to her going the extra mile,like s cup of change for me to use for the bus and  a loaded laundry card. I didn't do any laundry but those extra touches say a lot.,,,

And What a perfect location. Great apartment with everything you need and plenty of space to just hangout if you want! This was my first time to Boston so I did not know one neighborhood from the next, but we were so close to everything! We took a uber to Cambridge from the apartment and it was under $15. The public transit is all really easy to get to from where  the apartment is. On a map everything looks like it is so far away but will be just a couple of miles, so if you are up for a nice walk in a beautiful city I recommend walking from place to place! Cafe Nero around the corner had great coffee, B&G Oyster bar is around the corner as well, and Blackbird donuts down the block, all worth stopping into!"

James' apartment is confortable, and we enjoyed our time at his place.  We didn't meet him, but he let us a lot of useful informations in the apartment."

11902134,83564634,2016-07-03,72892493,Chris,"What a great location! James approach and communication was timely, responsive and professional.  The neighborhood is wonderful and readily accessible to Boston, etc... The home was great, and we really had a good feel for living in the South End. Lots of area pamphlets and information is readily available in the home.  We had been in NY prior to coming to Boston, so the Washer/Dryer were extremely helpful.  Everything you need to cook and/or clean is available.  Kitchen appliances and bathroom plumbing are older, but in good working order and we had no problems.  Would absolutely stay here again."
11902134,84505272,2016-07-07,43118689,Amy,"Overall a great stay at James' place! Can't beat the location and for the neighborhood, we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the fully stocked unit. James was very responsive via email and text and made every effort to make sure we had everything we needed. Check in/out was easy and James even accommodated our early arrival time. We would definitely stay here again!"

It's in historic south end Boston and thus property is older.  The furnishings are quite old and the shower in a bathtub with wrap around curtain takes some getting used to.  As long as can put up with some minor discomforts, a great deal in a great location."
11902134,88493968,2016-07-24,16338785,Amy,We loved our stay here. It was in the mid nineties while we were there and the AC kept it nice and cool. Beautiful building and street.

Small kitchen appliances, filthy; shower curtain liner, moldy; bathroom floor, filthy; one headboard nearly detached from bed; dining table broken; couch , torn; food in fridge very very expired (i.e. soy sauce, 2008)."
5991427,30266566,2015-04-19,31306237,Yannick,"Carols and her family were very friendly and the description of the place matched the actual experience. Given how expensive housing is in Boston, this place offered quite the bargain. All the essentials were present, and the place is well-furnished. The location of the house is very convenient - no longer than a 10-minute walk from the train station, and a 15-minute ride to downtown Boston. The only thing for me is that the neighborhood gets a little quiet after dark, but for the price we paid this was again a bargain for a weekend's stay."
5991427,32615296,2015-05-19,32876527,Dyanne,"The neighborhood was very quiet and residential but not far from a main road. The room was small but clean. The shared bathroom took getting used to but wasn't bad. Overall, I'd stay there again!"
5991427,33192181,2015-05-25,10927211,Hervé,"This place is in fact a hostel that Carols created in the basement of a house. Then, don't expect staying at Carols' place, and exchanging with her about Boston (we didn't see Carols, just her mother who opened us the door. She wes nevertheless very quick to answer the text messgaes)."
The kitchen,bathroom,and bedroom were clean. The bedroom was a little bit small,but with a TV (if you're interested in it) and wifi access.,,
"The main problem is that the \"\"hostel\"\" is located in the basement : it's quite dark and there is no windows",and no daylight coming.,,,,
We were also a little bit disappointed not to have towels (as it was said in the description).,,,,,
The other big flaw is the sound-proofing : the walls are thin and we could hear all the converation coming from the neighbouring bedroom.,,,,,
The location is quite good : 15 min walk from the red line,then you have a train every 10 minutes and then you reach downtown in 20 min.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5991427,33748329,2015-05-31,318832,Carin,Carols was easy to communicate with before arrival and saw to it that we could get into the room although she was not at home. We hardly didn't see or talk to the family but they seem nice and friendly.
The room is in the basement with 4 other rooms and is rather small,basic and dark. No space to sit down or put your suitcases. The bed is good. The kitchen and bathroom are very basic to. They tried to do a good job by painting the bright colours but it stays a basic basement. It looks better on the pictures than it is. We didn't know they do not provide towels so we didn't bring any,but Carols gave us towels as an exeption.Positive thing is that you can sit outside in the back when the sun is shining and that there is only a 10 minutes walk to the subway.,,,
"Prices in Boston for accomodation are bery high so when you afe on a budget there is not much choice but do not expect much.\"",,,,,
5991427,38059535,2015-07-12,37402701,Marie-Hélène,"La chambre était très propre est bien rangée, avec une armoire, une télé et un bureau, exactement comme sur les photos. Il y a aussi un ventilateur, ce qui est très agréable étant donné qu'il n'y a pas de fenêtre et qu'il peut y faire assez chaud. La salle de bain était assez propre également, ce que j'ai apprécié. Quant à la cuisine, j'étais satisfaite de l'équipement dont je disposais (notamment la vaisselle de base, le grille-pain et le petit four). Par contre, le frigo n'avait pas du tout été nettoyé et les étagères étaient toutes collantes."
Sinon,il était agréable de pouvoir manger dans la cour sur les tables et chaises de jardin.,,,,
Globalement,"je suis satisfaite de l'accueil de Carols et de sa famille; ils étaient toujours prêts à nous aider si besoin. J'ai aussi aimé le fait que de nombreuses cartes de la ville et du réseau de transport en commun étaient disponibles pour les invités.\"",,,,

Ligne rouge direct pr le centre ville (south station,  downtown...).  Très pratique pr les voyageurs comme nous qui arrivent par bus à la South Station."
Bel espace extérieur aménagé avec un petit salon de jardin sous moustiquaire,et un petit coin pour manger.,,,,
Chambre en sous sol de la maison.  4 chambres au total.  Cuisine et salle de bain partagées. Si toutes les chambres sont occupées cela peut peut être un peu compliqué de se partager l'espace commun.,,,,,
Lorsque nous y étions une seule autre chambre était occupée et nous avons pu cuisiner librement. Cuisine bien équipée.,,,,,
Salle de bain OK. Dommage que les serviettes de toilette ne soient pas fournies.  Même si c'est précisé dans l'annonce ce n'est pas très pratique.,,,,,
Pr ce qui est de la chambre,étant située en sous sol forcément ce n'est pas très lumineux; mais en vacances il est très fréquent que l'on soit dehors toute la journée et que l'on ne rentre que le soir à la chambre; du coup nous n'avons pas trop été gênés par cet aspect.,,,,
Toutefois le fait d'être en sous sol une odeur de renfermé persiste. Assez désagréable au départ.,,,,,
La chambre n'est pas grande et les murs qui séparent chaque chambre assez fins. Une fois encore si toutes les chambres sont occupées cela peut peut être poser des soucis d'intimité.,,,,,
Par contre le lit mérite d'être changé de façon urgente. Matelas à ressort très inconfortable,nous sentions tous les ressorts.,,,,
Nous n'avons pas rencontré Carols mais les contacts par internet ont toujours été très précis,sympathiques et la réactivité de Carols est très agréable.,,,,
"Dans l'ensemble nous avons passé un bon séjour.\"",,,,,

5991427,43342637,2015-08-18,30480587,Drew,"Great, simple hostel-styled basement. Personal room with shared kitchen and bathroom among 4 rooms total I think. The walk to the train is about 10 minutes but that's not too bad. The neighborhood isn't the greatest, but it seems safe enough with lots of fast food and convenient stores nearby."

Le quartier est bien desservi en transports et l'appartement n'est pas loin du métro,ce qui permet d'être dans le centre-ville en 20 minutes.,,,,
En revanche,le quartier n'est pas sur et on ne se sent pas en sécurité la nuit tombée.,,,,
De plus,le logement n'était pas propre. Nous avons eu l'impression que les draps n'avaient pas été lavés et que le ménage n'avait pas été fait dans la chambre.,,,,
La salle de bain était sale aussi et il n'y avait pas de serviettes de toilette ni de savon...,,,,,
Nous n'avons pas utilisé la cuisine car elle n'était pas propre non plus.,,,,,

5991427,76432826,2016-05-27,32921562,Miriam,We had a great 3 night stay at Carols place! The room was tiny but very lovely and clean. The neighborhood is save with some restaurants and stores right around the corner. It's only a 10 minutes walk to the Metro station. Carols was always very nice and helpful! We definitely would recommend this place to our friends for a trip to Boston!

Je pense qu elle a trouvé le moyen d'arrondir ses fins de mois, de plus elle n'était pas là pour nous accueillir.  Ne répond pas au message.  N'a pas sa place sur airbnb. A fuir."
5991427,92524165,2016-08-09,16391164,Güven,"Me and my wife stayed in Carol's place for 4 nights. It is 10 min walk to metro station. with metro it takes 20 min to city centre. It was ok, transportation was fine. but the room was absolutely not a bright one. actually it is part of a renovated basement with 4 rooms and one bathroom. and our room had a very small window which was not even possible to open. the room was quite humid inside and smells humid."
the bathroom was a shared one,we shared with some guys,who weren't flushing the toilet,which was not Carol's mistake. but it should be cleaned more often.,,
there was also a kitchen which was not so clean and not fully equipped. there were some place out of the basement,fine and nice to have breakfast.,,,,
Carol was not responding quickly before we arrived. we had to push her via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) to get some answers. During the stay she responded us and took care of our problems.,,,,,
To summarize,the room was like a cheap hostel room,for me,not in airbnb qualifications,where you feel like home. if you stay one or two nights,it's fine. for more nights
5991427,95323086,2016-08-19,70570583,Nathan,check in was smooth.. unfortunately never met the host.. room was clean and location was close to rail and bus connection..

2278704,13166958,2014-05-20,15447424,Ting,I felt at home when staying at Cynthia's house.  Home-style traditional Jamaican breakfast I have tried for the first time is an unexpected experience.  Transportation provided by Cynthia's family member has made my trip exceptionally ecomic one since it allows me skipping the pricy parking cost and no need to even rent a car.

A wide variety of breakfast foods and drinks were available upon waking up.  There is a big yard with the cutest and friendliest dog you will ever meet.  Every member of the family that we met in our short time there was very nice and ready for conversation.

I drove into Boston late at night not knowing what to expect from the host and the house. As soon as I arrived, Cynthia's daughter, Bobelle, greeted me and helped me in. She was wonderful to me during my entire stay.  She helped me with directions (after I got lost) and saved a parking spot for me a couple of nights. My room was large, comfortable, and clean, and the house was quiet. Having breakfast and coffee with Cynthia in her beautiful kitchen was a very pleasant experience. Over the course of four days I was able to meet several family members. They all made me feel very welcome.  It truly felt like visiting with family. You’ll love it there."

Wenn man aber Angst vor Afro-Amerikanern oder Jamaikanern hat, sollte man nicht in das Viertel gehen denn man fällt definitiv auf. Wir haben es aber als sicher empfunden und alle Leute waren sehr freundlich."
Frühstück war eine Auswahl aus Brot/Bagels mit Frischkäse,Erdnussbutter,Marmelade. Zu trinken gab es Kaffee,Wasser,Tee oder Saft.,
Chris,der Sohn,hat uns Jamaikanisches Essen näher gebracht. Wir waren sehr günstig ein paar Patties essen. Zudem hat er sofort geholfen,als wir ein Auto kaufen mussten.,,
Das Mobiliar ist nicht gerade das neueste,aber wir konnten gut schlafen und waren morgens ausgeruht. Unsere Privatsphäre wurde berücksichtigt und wer 2 Sterne zahlt,aber 5 erwartet und evtl keine andere Personen im selben Haushalt mag,für den ist AirBNB eher nichts.,,

the neighborhood is very quiet and residential. we felt we didn't want to stay outdoors too late at night there. it is also quite far from the main city. we had to take a bus to a train or two every time we wanted to venture out. we felt we spent a lot of our time on public transportation. it's about an hour to get to the center of Boston.,,,,,

It is a very family centered environment. Mattapan is sort of a hike outside of the city, but the bus stop is literally less than a block away. The room I stayed in was very comfortable and clean and, again, Cynthia was very accommodating. I would definitely stay there again if the need arose."
2278704,32370282,2015-05-17,18997464,Thiago,"Everything was perfect and as described, the room is very comfortable and it has everything I need. The bathroom is also really big. Cynthia is very nice host and for sure will help you with everything you need. Very recommended."
2278704,33223234,2015-05-26,26622532,Maciek,I spent one more night at Cynthia's after getting back from Montreal. Nothing changed from what I wrote about my previous stay there :)
2278704,33516408,2015-05-29,21480669,Thomas,"Cynthia and Keith are very nice hosts, super friendly and make sure the guests have everything they need. The room is big, clean and it looks exaclty as it looks on the pictures. They provided us with breakfast in the morning which is a very generous gesture which we appreciated a lot (bagels, fruits, coffee, tea, eggs, bacon). The small bathroom is shared with the whole family plus other guests but this was fine. I would recommend this place to other people, but it may not be the best one for people who like it ectremely clean because they do have pets which are definitely noticeable."
2278704,33590565,2015-05-30,26622532,Maciek,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here a couple of days and in fact I don't think we could find a better place in Boston. The room is cozy, there is wifi and tv, and the house is less than 2km walk from Mattapan Station which connects you to the Boston subway system. Cynthia and her family are  very warm, welcoming people. It was a pleasure to be there."
2278704,34025019,2015-06-03,34000039,Fiona,"This was my first Airbnb stay and I'm really happy that I choose to stay with Cynthia and her family. They were very welcoming and helped me to find my way around Boston. Although the house is located a little bit outside the Boston downtown area, it has a good connection to public transport(bus and train). I also enjoyed the breakfast they offered. All in all I would  recommend staying there and if I ever come back to Boston, I would stay with Cynthia and Keith again!"
2278704,34655615,2015-06-10,33564966,Zhang,The place is nice and beautiful. Families and pet here create a comfortable sense and Cynthia is nice and will to communicate with us.
2278704,34833135,2015-06-12,20279056,Violetta,Cynthia and Keith are both really nice and welcoming and it is great to chat with them! They are also very helpful and happy to provide suggestions/information on the area. The room was homey with a comfortable bed and their house is really close to public transportation. We definately recommend a stay with Cynthia and Keith. Violetta and Thomas
2278704,35171820,2015-06-15,35375527,Anna,"Thank you to Cynthia and her family for welcoming us into their home. We had a lovely experience. The room was great and the house was beautiful. We also had the added bonus if meeting the gorgeous Izzy, a very friendly dog."
2278704,35597027,2015-06-20,35191437,Nicole,"Très bon accueil de Cynthia et de Keith, son mari, très chaleureux tous les deux! Le petit déjeuner copieux était très appréciable. Chambre très confortable, petite difficulté, l'accès à la salle de bain/WC avec les 3 chambres occupées, un WC extérieur serait le bienvenu... Pour se rendre au centre ville, il faut compter une heure entre l'attente du bus, le trajet en bus 31, le métro, ligne orange, mais c'est faisable tout de même... Je recommande chaudement l'adresse!"

The room and the bathroom correspond to the description. The neighborhood seems fine, and it is 25 mins from downtown Boston taking a bus and then the subway."
2278704,42349618,2015-08-12,21000589,Luisa,"Staying at Cynthias house was really nice for me and my friend. Cynthia wasn't there for the first two days, but her grandchild Misha was. She showed us some spots in the city and we had a lot of fun. Their pets are so cute! Our room was very clean and we even had our own TV and Wi-Fi there. Breakfast is served in the morning, which is also really good."
It can be a little hard to get there,"especially if you're backpacking like us. But it is possible to go there via public transportation.\"",,,,
2278704,43574689,2015-08-20,12048979,Inge,We were part of the family. We felt very welcome. Breakfast is a social event.

2278704,46201530,2015-09-08,20713687,Sophie,Cynthia is a very nice and helpful person.
She made sure someone was there to welcome us after a long day of travel. She has a lovely house which is clean and familiar. Her house is 20 minutes away from downtown. We could use her kitchen any time. Cynthia made sure that we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. Her daughter always gave us good suggestions of places to go.,,,,,
And the best was: the breakfast every morning :),,,,,
Thank you very much,"for the nice time.\"",,,,
2278704,47440499,2015-09-18,38614432,Daniel,"My wife and I loved it here, Mrs. Cynthia was a great host.  Honestly, the room was big and comfortable like an upscale hotel.  Public Transportation was close by.  Would highly recommend!"
"\"",,,,,
2278704,47804606,2015-09-21,43306941,Sheila,Cynthia was very responsible. I contacted her before checking in to see what we needed to do and she responded within a good time frame.  Room was clean and warm and her family members definitely made us feel at home.
2278704,48328337,2015-09-25,42866549,Jun Hui,"Cynthia and her family were extremely accommodating and friendly to us. They took care of our short stay in Boston. The location is great, just one block away from bus station and Boston transportation system doesn't disappoint. All in all, I had a great airbnb experience with Cynthia and family."
2278704,49059114,2015-09-30,28876039,Andrés,Nice comfortable room. Bed was perfect for me. Everything is very organized! They were kind enough to let me stay one night only.
2278704,50362085,2015-10-11,44701555,Ana,"Everything was awesome. We felt like home, staying there. Cynthia and her family were so nice and kind to us. We learned so fast how to get to downtown and it was only 25 min. to get there."
2278704,50532400,2015-10-12,39346207,Manohar,The place is okay for budget travel & short-term stay.
2278704,51200348,2015-10-18,22294619,Larisa,Cynthia and her whole family were very welcoming.  My daughter and I felt ourselves at home.  Cynthia went above and beyond to help us navigate Boston.  I wish her and her family well.
2278704,51420150,2015-10-19,327878,Harry,The host is very accommodating in terms of the schedule of checking in. Keep in good communication. Very helpful by arranging pick up at the bus stop. The room is spacious.
2278704,52138635,2015-10-26,14953069,Anastacia,"I loved staying with Cynthia and Keith. They are both wonderful kind people, and the room was perfect. I recommend this Air B and B to anyone! I would stay here again in a heart beat. Thanks again for a great stay in Boston!"
2278704,70538820,2016-04-18,66750236,Judith,"My visit was quick, just a night, but the room was just what we needed. Comfy firm bed, clean sheets and towels, and a great shower! The family was welcoming but not obtrusive. Cynthia was welcoming and generous."
2278704,74162424,2016-05-13,68651998,Colin,"Stayed for 4 days at this residence in Dorchester. About 40 mins to get downtown in all (walk + bus + train). Parking easily available outside. The room was spacious and had a good view + clean. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean. Did have some bathroom issues as only 1 bathroom shared with a family of 3 people + 2 guest bedrooms. Me and my companion woke up early each morning to avoid these bathroom issues, but the last day we were a bit delayed as the second guest bedroom was rented . Other than that was a delight staying with the family, its dog and rarely visible cat."
2278704,74987953,2016-05-18,15693421,Eric,"Overall great experience. Very comfortable and clean room, very good food in the morning, and very kind and welcoming hosts. I'd definitely stay here again."
2278704,78749717,2016-06-08,13530755,Anna,"Das Zimmer war geräumig und wie beschrieben, mit einem bequemen Doppelbett und sogar Fernseher im Zimmer selbst. Badezimmer und Küche werden mit der Familie geteilt, aber alles problemlos und sehr sauber."
Cynthia selbst haben wir leider nicht kennengelernt,dafür hat uns ihre Enkelin sehr freundlich willkommen geheißen. Die Gastgeber waren auch sehr flexibel mit der Ankunftszeit.,,,,
Das Zimmer liegt etwas außerhalb von Boston,ist aber mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln gut zu erreichen (Bushaltestelle nah beim Haus 10 Minuten Fahrt + 25 Min. mit der U-Bahn; alternativ 12 Min. gehen + 20 Min. Fahrt mit der S-Bahn).,,,,
Auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen,"haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt!\"",,,,
2278704,83002798,2016-06-30,804939,Sorin,First of all I want to mention that Cynthia is a very nice and welcoming person and we enjoyed her presence.
We were a bit disappointed that the room didn't quite look like it was presented in the pictures on the site,though maybe our expectations were a bit high. The bathroom could have been cleaner.,,,,
Overall it was ok,"but we have to rate it as average because we had better accommodation during our US trip. \"",,,,
2278704,83668076,2016-07-03,41803072,Audrey,"The host had been very welcoming, the room was clean, the sheets were too (very important). There was A/C and wifi. No problem with having our privacy. The house is in a Jamaican neighborhood, it had been a bit of culture shock but we felt at home really quickly and we're happy to learn more about the culture and the food. Great experience, we would book with her again !"

2278704,84292043,2016-07-06,71584207,Michael,"Cynthia nous a très bien reçu! Nous avions une grande chambre avec la télévision et le Wi-Fi, l'air climatisé, un lit très confortable, des maps et feuillets informatifs de Boston à notre disposition et surtout la très sympathique famille de Cynthia pour nous accommoder!"
2278704,85511405,2016-07-11,34390761,AnneMarie,"Cynthia met us very late to let us in and was very welcoming and accommodating. The house and room was clean and pleasant. Unfortunately we stayed on a Saturday night and the noise from the street was very loud as various neighbors were partying. The Windows are thin and if you are a light sleeper this place might be difficult on a weekend. Also, the walls are thin and you can hear if people are walking around outside the room which is another difficulty for light sleepers. We ended up not getting any sleep because we are both light sleepers and decided to stay somewhere else the next night. A lovely and clean home over all with kind hosts though."
2278704,88424733,2016-07-24,85532717,Arlene,It was a very comfortable home and vwry beautiful.  The riom was perfect and just what we needed for the night.  Everyone in the home was super nice and helpful.
2278704,89580160,2016-07-29,44039995,Chirag,"Cynthia was great! She was very helpful in giving us ways to get to and around the city as first timers! Our room was nice and clean too! Her home is located a few miles away from the city, but it is so quick and easy to get there via bus, train, or car. Overall, she was an awesome host and her home is a decent place to stay for a couple of nights."
2278704,91469750,2016-08-05,25108250,Maleen,"The host hasnt been there as said via mail before. When we arrived another couple was waiting for the closed door. After 45 Minutes her son arrived, but didnt let us in. After a while and a call with his Mum, we could enter. We asked to cook Pasta Because we were very hungry, he didnt allow. We had to wait until his mom came. She was at least Friendly. The Room was okay, tv doesnt work. Bath not that Expected clean. Loud Family. For one short Night okay."
2278704,92037276,2016-08-07,48958788,Josileide,"Cynthia and her family were so nice w me and my BF, they waited for us until 4am to do check in , we felt free in her house!

10730,10969,2009-09-21,38782,Alejandro,"I went to Boston with my wife and my 7-month old son. The apartment was very nice, good located, Anne was quite helpful; and the whole experience is highly recommended."
10730,12385,2009-10-04,39067,Erin,"The location was perfect--right next to a T stop and about 10 to 15 minutes from anywhere we wanted to go. The apartment was in a very nice building.  The apartment itself was fine, though directions for connecting to the internet would've been helpful.  The apartment was clean, though dusty.  We ended up having to change the sheets as they were not clean, fresh linens.  There also wasn't any toilet paper, paper towels, or coffee filters so we had to get our own. Anne was very kind and helpful, though.  I would definitely recommend staying here or in another one of her properties.  I would certainly stay at one of her properties the next time I'm in Boston."
10730,14243,2009-10-19,20229,Howie,"Wow, Anne offers a nice Apartement near the Town Hall and is very helpful with everything. We had a very good time and would visit again for sure. Thank you again, Anne. ;O)"
10730,14959,2009-10-25,43960,Christine,"We had an enjoyable stay. The location was perfect. The place was comfortable, although a hair dryer in the apartment would be helpful. We did not have the best return communication from Anne prior to our arrival, however, she was very pleasant and helpful in person. We would not hesitate to stay here in the future, and we have already recommended it to friends."
10730,17355,2009-11-15,37366,Paul,"A bit of a pain getting access but the place is nice enough, in a great area and the building itself is very nice"
10730,37242,2010-04-22,103573,John,Great location and very helpful host. Everything I needed was in the apartment. Warm inside on the cold days. Very reasonable rates as well. Much more homely than a hotel room. This will be my first choice next time I come to Boston.
10730,41654,2010-05-11,104700,Frances,"The Apartment was great. Perfect location, 2 mins from Boston Common. Everything you need for your stay is in the apartment and it is close to all amenities. Easy access to and from airport and around Boston on T. Cheaper than a hotel and a lot more private. Would not hesitate to stay here again"
10730,79150,2010-08-16,105835,Afroditi,"The appartment was real value for (URL HIDDEN) was centrally located and provided easy access to Boston's attractions.the apartment itself was cosy and comfortable.Due to location there is trouble with parking and the nearby parking places are quite expensive.However the parking in Boston common had more reasonable prices.Overall we enjoyed our stay in the bright one bedroom on Beacon st. Anne was a very helpful host ,accessible and provided us with all info necessary.She was friendly and helpful.Iwould recomend her as a host."
10730,4104914,2013-04-10,4238256,Jose,My stay was very good.
Anne is very helpful and readily available.,,,,,
The apartment has old furniture but is very comfortable and quiet. Heating works like a charm. Bathroom is spacious and the kitchen has all you'll need.,,,,,
The bed sofa can accomodate two people. If you plan on having visitors note there aren't doors between the livingroom and the bedroom (there's a corridor) and the bathroom door opens to the bedroom.,,,,,
Wi-fi works fine and with good bandwith.,,,,,
The location is simply the best. Being a young adult,It's a 2 minute walk to Park station,5 min to State and Downtown Crossing (and that should cover all T lines). It's a 15 min walk to the MGH hospital complex or the shopping area at Boylston/Newbury street. Boston University,Beth Israel,Harvard square are 30 min away by T line. You're on top of the hill which isn't too steep to walk around. There's lots of pubs,fast food and restaurants. There's a very helpful conveniency store with ATM machine on the building next door.
If you're planning on visiting Boston for tourism you might not even need public transportation to see 80% of the city's points of interest. If you come to work,you'll get most places fast. The Beacon Hill neighborhood is a lovely and safe location to just stroll around.,,,,
Taxi cost me around 25$ from the airport to the apartment sunday night. If you bring luggage from the silver line note that Park street station does not have elevators.,,,,,
"Definitely would come back.\"",,,,,
10730,13222908,2014-05-22,11533513,Inka,Our stay at Anne's place was great. Anne was very professional and easy to communicate with. The apartment had everything we needed plus an amazing view of Boston from the rooftop deck. The location is perfect. We would definitely book again.
10730,14549840,2014-06-22,12335207,Eduardo,Just loved it! Thanks!
10730,16072187,2014-07-22,4765216,Michael,This apartment in Boston was prefect for me.  I was in town for a month for work and had my wife visiting so I wanted a place with more than a hotel could provide.
This apartment has an amazing view of the Golden Dome from the living room. The kitchen is small but adequate.  The bedroom is big and full of light.  The mattress and pillows are old and need replacing. The bathroom is big with minimal to no counter space and low water pressure but not terrible.,,,,,
I was in Boston in July. It was hot.  There is one widow AC in the living room which cools nicely but as the bedroom is down a long hallway it stayed a pretty warm temp. So,I asked for a fan to get some of the cool air from the AC down to the bedroom.  Anne provided one the next day. I like it cool/cold when I sleep and the fan was perfectly adequate to make me comfortable sleeping. I suggest getting a 2nd AC for the bedroom however the fan worked just fine.,,,,
Anne was extremely accommodating.  To the extent of not only getting a fan,but getting a new TV for me when I mentioned I travel with an AppleTV and the existing TV didn't have an HDMI port.  I came home the next evening and she had replaced the TV with a newer one that had the necessary inputs!,,,,
The Building is beautiful with a doorman and rooftop deck over looking the Golden Dome and Commons in an amazing area.  Just beautiful. I had a great time.,,,,,
"I highly recommend this listing.\"",,,,,
10730,18464599,2014-08-27,12844676,Brent,"The place was great and as described in the listing. Anne was excellent, quickly responsive to any communications,  and a pleasure to work with. I will do business with her again next time."
10730,20561331,2014-10-01,18552226,Gautam,"This is a lovely apartment, and Anne is a great host. She has just the right mix of attention and non-interference. We never saw her, but replies to text messages came almost instantly. Everything was where it should be (from the keys to the coffee filters), and the place was very clean. The location is convenient and the building is lovely. The kitchen is well-equipped but a little cramped, but then most people on holiday will probably not be eating in much."
"We know where we will be staying when we come back to Boston! \"",,,,,

10730,45073374,2015-08-31,20157265,Lindsay,"Anne was very responsive and very helpful! The location of the apartment can't be beat. The only caveat is that the bed is uncomfortable. There is only one a/c unit, which worried me, but with the aid of a box fan, the whole apartment cooled down quickly. Thanks, Anne!"
10730,50431695,2015-10-12,2105155,Pam,"The apartment  was clean and move in ready!  The kitchen was great, it allowed us to cook for ourselves and not eat out everyday. Whole foods is right around the corner."

Il est près de tous les spots de la ville (la grande bibliothèque,  Trinity Church, le freedom trail...). Il est très beau et bien emménagé. Nous étions 3 et nous nous sommes sentis à l'aise. Le quartier est securitaire et plein de charme. Jesse est très avenant et la communication avec lui est facile Je recommande cet appartement pour passer un bon séjour à Boston qui soit dit en passant est magnifique."
Good place! Near touristic spots at Boston ( Public Library,Trinity Church,Freedom Trail...). Spaceful,"beautiful furniture. Safe neighbour and so charming. Jesse is a good host and the contact with him is easy.  Boston is a beautiful city and Jesse's is the perfect to enjoy your trip.\"",,

My host Jesse was very courteous with my check in and check out. I look forward to Returning to Boston and staying in this great location.
11211273,65834784,2016-03-17,35355483,Mona,"Jesse's apartment has an unbeatable location. We were within walking distance of almost everything in Boston including the Public Garden, Downtown Crossing, Boston Commons, Newbury Street and much more. As for the apartment itself, it's small so it's good for 2-3 people, more than that it will be too crammed. One of the downsides, there was no place for us to put our clothes all the ,closets were full. The kitchen is not fully stocked; so you have to go food shopping as soon as you get here. The Wifi is excellent, very fast. The bathroom is small; the tub wasn't very clean, towels weren't plentiful so I suggest bringing extras. Other than that everything was good, and we had a good stay."

11211273,70683630,2016-04-19,35152322,John,The location could not be beat for marathon week-end. There was plenty of bottled water for our runner :)   Jesse went out of his way to make sure we would have enough bedding for the four of us. It was a tad small for four people but it certainly worked. Jesse was very accommodating regarding check-in and check-out. We would stay there again if we were to visit Boston again.
11211273,73818768,2016-05-10,54341035,James,"Clean room, clean sheets, clean towels, toiletries. Wifi was provided, overall had a decent experience."
11211273,74004949,2016-05-12,11459211,Josh,"Jesse is a fantastic host. From our first communication to checking out, he went out of his way to be friendly and helpful. He provides a great list of recommendations to local restaurants and sights in the area. The apartment itself is located on one of the most beautiful streets in Boston, and overall made for a very comfortable and restful stay. When I'm back in Boston, I hope Jesse's place will be available so I can stay again-one of my best Airbnb experiences yet!"
11211273,74550428,2016-05-15,10919287,Erwin,"The loft was spacious, my family had a great stay. Would recommend 5/5."
11211273,75044095,2016-05-18,12671033,Gail,"Had a wonderful few days in Boston at Jesse's Back Bay studio.  It is as cute as pictured and in a fantastic location.  We literally walked EVERYWHERE we wanted to go no problem - the riverfront, Newbury St, the Provincial Tower, Public Library, Faneuil Hall (and I know I spelled that wrong - sorry!), Public Garden, Commons, to the harbor for a cruise, North End/Little Italy... it was great!!  Apt is clean, cute, comfy, nice kitchen, couple interesting books, TV (which we never watched - too many other things to do!), plenty of room for two.  Jesse was nice, met us on the front steps, left us some touring info... nice host.  Would definitely stay here again."
11211273,76261100,2016-05-26,12801404,Branden,"My folks from the west coast were visiting me in NY, so we planned a night in Boston, as they had never been before.  This place is AWESOME! The location is amazing,  lots of food options, bars, coffee shops, and everything else you can think of.  Commonwealth Ave is gorgeous, and all of Boston is pretty much walking distance from this place.  The place itself is super cool.  Old, but super well kept building with lots of character.  Jesse was great as well.  I got in a little late but he was able to meet with me and my folks at the door step, gave us a 5 minute tour of the place, handed a handy sheet with all kinda of things to do,  places to eat, etc and then he was on his way.  Great host."
11211273,78070394,2016-06-05,65494974,Adam,Great location and great place. The place was within walking distance to Feenway Park!. Jesse was very accommodating and flexible with our arrivals and departures. I would definitely stay here again.
11211273,78721891,2016-06-08,71675783,Chris,"A fantastic central location, and a great way to live like a local. Jesse was great to work with and I would definitly rent here again."
11211273,80346328,2016-06-17,5658259,Carlos,"This was a great stay in Boston! The location is excellent, the place is very comfortable, and the interaction with Jesse, the host, was very straightforward. Jesse was very flexible about my check in time and met me to show me the place and give me information upon my arrival. Everything was clean and ready to go. When needed, Jesse was quick to reply and give me information as needed. Checkout was a breeze. Would happily stay here again."
11211273,80801438,2016-06-19,39752872,Tim,"Great location and a very charming building. The place is cozy, but was perfect for me, my wife and teenage daughter. Quiet at night and close walking distance to lots of dining, shopping and entertainment in Boston. Bed was a little uncomfortable for me and my wife, but wouldn't stop us from staying here again. Host Jesse was a great communicator and flexible with check in and out. Recommend!"
11211273,84767989,2016-07-09,81906665,Sue,Jesse was gracious and very approachable. He gave us great direction of the area with a list of places to go and things to do. Really enjoyed meeting him!
11211273,85651702,2016-07-12,60504457,Emily,"Jesse's apartment was a great place to be for our few days in Boston. It was in a very convenient location and had everything we needed. Its view of the park was very pleasant, and it was great to be near the action on Boylston and Newbury Streets. We had a great time there!"
11211273,86537271,2016-07-16,81011342,Humaira,This is absolutely the best location in Boston. I wanted to show my kids what it's like to live in Boston and thanks to Jesse's bnb I did.
Jesse wa super nice and accommodating in terms of check in and check out.,,,,,
I was worried abt my morning coffee so he went an bought extra nespresso pods.,,,,,
The place is cute and full of character. My kids loved the loft. He has board games,books and an Apple TV was a big plus. You can watch pretty much anything you want if you have an apple product that connects to internet.,,,,
The kitchen was full of pleasant surprises,coconut oil,couscous ... Yum,,,
Jesse said he vacuumed before we came . That's the only thing I can think of which he can improve upon.,,,,,
He cleaned like a typical guy,not like a cleaning lady.,,,,
"Mattress and bedding was average but again at home I've splurged on memory foam so I shouldn't compare !\"",,,,,
11211273,87795497,2016-07-21,67359793,Hui,"The room is perfect! We liked it a lot. Jesse always responded in time and helped us to fixed the wifi. In the room, there are coffee and beer and was really helpful when we just arrived. We should fill in some coffe and bear for the newcomer, although we stayed too little time and left too early. Sorry for that. Jesse left us a list with best restaurants we could try. Thanks a lot. Hopefully we didn't damage anything in that lovely room."
11211273,89478006,2016-07-28,28945923,Hong,"The location of Jessie’s house is very good, and we basically walked to everywhere in our 4 days of stay in Boston, and the metro transportation is also very convenient. The couch and bed are comfortable and I’ll recommend this place to my friends."
11211273,91470046,2016-08-05,14489430,Jeff,"\"My wife and 7 year old son stayed in Jesse's and it was perfect.  My son especially like that he got to sleep in the loft.  The location was great.  It was very convenient to many restaurants, the \"\"T\"\" and within walking distance of many sights.  We would definitely recommend the place and would stay there again.\""
11211273,92439521,2016-08-08,24241184,Michael,Jesse was a great host and the apartment was situated in a perfect location.

10881994,65696796,2016-03-16,38246439,Robert,"Paige's place was great. The location is on beautiful Commonwealth Avenue, which has a nice park through the middle that leads you to the Boston gardens. Perfect for walking a dog or just getting some excercise. Shopping and restaurants are only a few blocks away. Fenway park is close by and there is a stop for the hop-on hop-off trolley that will take you on a tour of the whole city."
10881994,66410529,2016-03-22,56412216,Meredith,"Stay at this place. It's a great location for walking or taking the T anywhere you need to go in Boston. Great neighborhood, the apartment is very spacious/clean, and the host is extremely responsive/friendly and we got a deal for staying at her place. Couldn't have had a better experience!"
10881994,66895149,2016-03-25,56038049,Kristin,Paige was very easy to get in contact with via text message. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for our stay.
10881994,68367394,2016-04-04,53549227,Christina,"This apartment has a perfect location. Only a block and half away from the T and steps away from Newberry St., which has plenty of restaurants, galleries, and shops. The apartment has two rooms plus a bathroom and the kitchen is fully stocked; both beds are also comfortable. Paige was a fantastic host and always responded immediately if we needed anything."

10881994,69795775,2016-04-13,1760217,Lauren,"We had a great time at this location! It was perfectly located near Fenway Park and so many awesome restaurants and bars. My Favorites were Mei Mei Street Kitchen, Hojoko, Eastern Standard and so many more. I would love to return one day!"
10881994,71302964,2016-04-24,66249468,Jessica,"The location was fantastic, in a cute building on a beautiful block, and close to Newbury Street, the T station, and great places to eat. Paige was extremely responsive and provided us with everything we needed. Check in and check out were fast and easy. This Airbnb really made our weekend in Boston amazing :)"
10881994,73073209,2016-05-06,59909238,Jonathan,the apartment was exactly as presented in the profile... Paige was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed... location was great for walking and very inviting... 5 stars!
10881994,73358490,2016-05-08,14376843,Peggy,"This is a review for 384 Commonwealth 42, Boston, MA."
Unfortunately,we did not have a good experience. We arrived at the apartment around 6PM,after a long day of traveling. The main problem was the extreme heat coming from the old style wall unit heaters in each of the rooms. There is no thermostat control in the apartment to regulate the heat. When we tried to plug in the air conditioning unit in the bedroom,the wall outlet started to spark because the cord was frayed. We had no choice but to open the windows and cool off the apartment. The building is on a very busy main street,so between the traffic and parties,it was pretty loud.
This is an old somewhat run down building. While it's decorated very nicely,the pictures don't represent the old condition of the apartment. Also,the TV didn't work,the main room heating unit was leaking and there was significant dry rot on the floor,the bathroom sink hot water spigot didn't work,and there was a lot of peeling paint.
We tried to contact Paige by email,phone,and text from 6-9PM,but there was no response. We finally heard back from her by text at 4:15am.,,
By this point we were exhausted,and decided we couldn't stay for the second night. We texted Paige to tell her we were leaving before her 11AM checkout time. We walked a few doors down to the Eliot Hotel,and they were nice enough to let us check in early.,,,
We asked for a $200 refund from Paige,but she said she never gives refunds for any reason. We submitted a resolution request through Airbnb,and because of our pictures and explanations,they agreed to refund the $200 since Paige would not. They also gave us $60 towards a future Airbnb booking. We have had great experiences with our last 2 Boston Airbnb rentals,and we will absolutely use Airbnb again. But I cannot recommend Paige or this apartment.,

Close to Fenway Park and only a block away from Newbury Street and shops!  The apartment was clean and as described/shown in pictures!  Loved our stay in this apartment!"
10881994,76184355,2016-05-25,40599865,Changlong,"we lived in 384 commonwealth avenue 42, where is great location,5-10mins walking to Newbury St. There are a lot of nice restaurants, stores and bars nearby.  It is really convenience for tourists living here. Due to cleaning lady’s careless, they forget to clean our apartment when we arrived. That was really disappointing. We contacted Paige, she quickly responded us and sent a cleaning lady to clean the apartment.  My friends and I read the instructions and followed what it tells us, but we still cannot find additional sheets, towels. The apartment should give more instructions for future Airbnbers about these, or just putting on the bed. Anyway, Paige is a kind and helpful host, very patient answer all of our questions."
10881994,76658137,2016-05-28,63472727,Katherynn,"\"Although we had good communication from Paige before we arrived in Boston for our trip and she did allow us to drop our bags early since check-in time wasn't until 3, I can't say we had a pleasant stay.  When we arrived to check in the apartment at 3 it was extremely hot since it was almost 90 degrees that day.  After trying to plug in the air conditioner it was apparent it wasn't working.  I contacted Paige to ask her about the air conditioner.  She stated that her assistant dropped off a new one and they were installing them in June, but for us to feel free to put it in the window and replace the old one ourselves.  WHAT?!?!  I was so shocked by her response.  I stated that that is not something WE should be doing.  Then she stated that she could come by help us install it in the morning because \"\"they are super light and easy\"\".  Obviously she knew there was an issue with the air conditioner before we arrived...why was it not fixed/installed beforehand?  The new one is sitting in the bedroom.  Not only is it unprofessional"
10881994,77266266,2016-05-31,9916614,Penny,"Paige was an amazing host! All of the instructions were clear and concise, and we had everything we needed. The location of the apartment was top-notch too. All in all, a great stay in a great city :)"
10881994,77771418,2016-06-03,9687492,Elisabeth,"L'appartement est bien situé dans Boston. Ceci étant, il n'est pas aussi agréable que les photos le laissent paraître. De plus, la proximité d'une voie express ne permet pas aisément d'ouvrir les fenêtres lorsqu'il fait chaud, surtout si l'air conditionnée ne marche pas (notons qu'elle ne fonctionne que dans la chambre)."
Pour ce qui est des relations avec Paige. Nous pouvons dire que Paige est un hôte qui a su répondre rapidement lorsque nous l'avons contacté pour les dysfonctionnements de l'air conditionné et l'excessive chaleur de l'appartement. En revanche,les notes et consignes laissées dans l'appartement ne sont pas très claires,tout comme le fonctionnement de la clé d'accès. Par chance,"ce sont des voisins qui nous ont renseignés et nous ont permis de rentrer chez nous le premier soir !\"",,

Cute apartment: clean, quiet, comfortable bed and fold-out couch with nice sheets, good towels (and two towels per-person - appreciated!), and a well-equipped kitchen. Clear instructions, both in text sent prior to our visit and instructions in the apartment. We were glad we'd brought a small fan for the main room, based on comments from other people who'd stayed - indoor temperature was very comfortable with fan, even with warm weather."

4364925,23131793,2014-11-23,14423582,Michele,"This 2-bedroom apartment was quite spacious and definitely enough for me and 4 of my friends. The high ceilings made the space seem even more spacious, so place is actually bigger than it seems in the pictures. The place was well-decorated and had everything that we needed (i.e. towels, sheets, dining ware, etc.). The closest T stops are about a 10-minute walk away. The neighborhood is quiet as there are many families who live in the area, and there are a number of great restaurants nearby. I'd definitely recommend this place for a visit to Boston."

4364925,52471133,2015-10-29,6547268,Julie,"What a terrific surprise this stay was! In town for a convention at the Hynes, we chose to spend the night at this beautiful unit rather than the hotels in the area. Great price, far more comfortable than any hotel room would have been and a very short walk from the convention center. Perfectly clean and prepared for our arrival. We will definitely repeat this the next time we need a place to stay."
4364925,55521348,2015-12-01,49701434,Steven,"It was a last minute trip. Glenn was very good helping us check in late. Apartment was great, had plenty of everything you would expect from upscale hotel and more. Keep in mind it's a very old building, but apartment is in excellent condition. Great area, nice restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner within walking distance.  Parking is tough, but very easy to get uber. Overall very good experience, loved Boston. Staying in this apartment definitely adds to Boston experience."

He also worked with us when we had a change in plans for getting the keys. The place was in a great neighborhood and I felt safe. There are plenty of restaurants and bars within a ten minute walk in almost any direction. If you are looking for great breakfast sandwiches, take a nice 15 minute walk to Mike and Patty's. The apartment had nice upgraded features, with plenty of utensils and pots/pans to make meals. All of the beds were very comfortable. It was clean and cozy. The cross street has one side of 2 hr visitor parking M-F 8am - 6pm, so we were able to save some money over the weekend. I would stay here again and would recommend to my friends."

During our trip to Boston,we stayed in Glenn's place as a party of four. It was roomy,well equipped,very clean   and definitely large enough for all four of us. The building is charming and very typical of the south E scene. We found the location very convenient to get to anywhere in Boston.,,
Kevin,a friend of Glenn,met us upon arrival and was very kind to stay and point out his favourite spots in the local area. Communication was always clear throughout the stay.,,,
"If you're ever in Boston we highly recommend staying here. Thanks Glenn.  \"",,,,,

4364925,69066628,2016-04-09,51943120,M.R.,Lovely flat in excellent location. We particularly enjoyed the Appleton cafe on Dartmouth Street. Kevin came to meet us reliably and Glenn responded to our queries.
4364925,70145295,2016-04-16,54284590,Lynn,"Loved our stay in unit #3.  Four of us stayed in this unit.  It was spacious, clean and had very comfortable beds.  We had everything we needed for our stay and Kevin who met us at the unit, made us feel right at home.  I would definitely stay here again.  Great home and great location in Boston."

"with our move in; definitely would return \"",,,,,
4364925,71977273,2016-04-30,51252282,Emma,"We had a wonderful stay at #3 670 Tremont. Prior to our stay Glenn and Kevin gave us tips on where to park, which was most useful. Upon arrival we were greeted by Kevin who have us a great run through of everything we needed to know. He also had a pack and play there for my 1 year old, which was great. The place was well equipped and even had tea/coffee etc. The towels were lovely and soft and the place was nice and clean with lovely big rooms with high ceilings. The location was perfect, all the main attractions of the city were walkable. There is also a Starbucks and a mini supermarket within a few minutes walk. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone visiting Boston."

Having three sets of keys was very convenient."
4364925,76678776,2016-05-28,8649222,Teresa,"The listing was accurate, and both Glenn and Kevin were very helpful. The apartment was spic and span, and the beds were very comfortable. The location was also great. The only thing I'd suggest is that it's made clear that, because it's on the first floor, there is noise from the apartment(s) overhead, so it might not work for people looking for more peaceful accommodations. That said, it is in an apartment building (not a private home) so knowing that one can always come prepared with earplugs!"
4364925,76889734,2016-05-29,60491572,Matthew,The place was extremely well kept and spacious with easy access to everything in Boston.  We were able to get to the apt very easily with a gracious host.

The apartment was very comfortable, the KS bed we slept in was probably the best bed we've ever slept in. We cooked a simple pasta dish that night & the kitchen is well stocked. Location was very handy as a base from which to explore Boston. We enjoyed our 3 night stay very much"
4364925,78229038,2016-06-05,55596044,Africa,"The place was exactly as it is described in the pictures.  The area was great! We walked home from MIT graduation, we walked to the Prudential Center and environs...that's how close it is to everything! Five of us fitted comfortably in the apt. Everything was great. We didn't get to meet Glenn but met Kevin who was just as pleasant. Highly recommended...hoping to come back in a few months!"

L'appartement est spacieux et bien équipé.  L'accueil a été très facile, car une personne s'occupe de l'appartement."
4364925,89225524,2016-07-27,38966718,Cynthia,Glenn was not available but he had someone waiting for us on our arrival.  She gave us a tour and told us everything we needed to know.  She was very pleasant and helpful.

4364925,98154089,2016-08-29,45743229,Yung,"This home was beautiful, spacious, tidy, and equipped for the 7 (4 seniors and 3 adults) of us who were in Boston to attend a family wedding. It was located in a very convenient and central area with lots of delightful restaurants and cafes within walking distance.  Our hosts did note the inconvenience of finding day and overnight parking for our cars ahead of time.  Parking was definitely a big issue for us.  While the last minute addition of our aunt required us to pay an extra fee, we weren't too fussed since we did change from 6 to 7 guests in the last minute and paid.  Exchanging keys was smooth and Kevin was helpful in providing all the necessary information about the apartment and neighbourhood.  Thanks for a wonderful stay! I would definitely recommend this home for others visiting  B-town!"

13509242,93635824,2016-08-13,40061790,Jaclyn,"Afsoon was very good at communicating prior to the trip, however we went out of our way to accommodate her because she was not there in person to deliver the keys. The apartment was ready for us, but was less than could be desired. Perhaps we expected too much, but it was average for our stay in Boston. In the future we would probably spend more for a nicer place."

The apartment is kept very clean , and nicely furnished.  The kitchen is completey set up, and is awsome.  Bathroom is also very clean.  Easily would handle four.  Beds were very comfortable.  Very quiet neighborhood.  We really enjoyed our stay here and hope to return sometime."
6080461,35467138,2015-06-19,31944512,Shaun,Terry is a very welcoming host and couldn't be more helpful.
The accommodation is great. The furnishings really make you feel like you're at home. We are a family of 4 and there was plenty of room. The building has lots of character,and the neighbours are nice and friendly.,,,,
The location is safe,quiet and very pleasant. It's a very short walk to the bus and train.,,,,

It's one full bed and a pull-out couch (the couch wasn't super comfortable for sleeping, but it worked and the bed was great)."
The Uber drivers didn't have anything positive to say about the neighborhood around this apartment,but we didn't have any problems during our stay.,,,,
A very minor and somewhat amusing con: the low part of the bathtub is at the opposite end from the drain. No big deal,just a heads up.,,,,
The water is great,the electric locks make it simple,"and it was an affordable place to stay.\"",,,
6080461,47204952,2015-09-16,42869253,Kristin,We had a wonderful experience.  Terry was very responsive throughout the process.  The apartment was just as described and was impeccably clean.  There was a very nice welcome book with lots of great information.  Highly recommend staying here!
6080461,48536085,2015-09-27,38380564,Elizabeth,"The apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures, very clean and cozy. The neighborhood did not match the description for Roxbury in our opinion. We were pleased with the close proximity to the metra station. Terry's recommendations were fantastic!!"
6080461,49039902,2015-09-30,43351188,John,"Didn't get to meet Terry , but everything was in perfect shape. Beautiful apartment, great location, the walk into the city is a little long (20 minutes) but doable. Street parking was available and we never had an issue finding a spot. Highly recommend Terry's apartment."
6080461,51142159,2015-10-18,43041901,Lisa,"My husband and I had a great stay in the second floor unit. The building is full of original character but also has the conveniences of a modern home. It is located a short walk from the train which will take you right to downtown in 10-15 min. The neighbourhood is also full of character. Although we were not out too late at night we felt very safe walking back from the train. Parking is very limited in the neighbourhood so this is something to keep in mind if you do have car. There is a grocery store a 15 min walk away, which was easy to walk from with a few groceries for breakfasts and snacks. Terry was easy to get a hold of and directions for getting to and into the apartment were very clear. Overall a great alternative to the high priced hotels of downtown."
6080461,53263312,2015-11-07,3641741,Jenn,"Great apartment, beautiful building, easy-access neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again. Slept like a log! For sleeping four I think a couple with two small children would be ok. Thanks Terry!"

5940866,32913082,2015-05-23,18059325,Sherry,I had a great time with Valerie and Jason. They were very kind and attentive hosts.
The room itself was expertly prepared for. It came with lots of towels,a hair dryer,and even bottled water. The room is very spacious and very comfortable. There is even a mini fridge and additional closet space. The only down side is that it can be a bit loud in the morning,not sure if it was a one time thing when I was there,but it is always a good rule of thumb to bring ear plugs. The bathroom was located a bit far from the room,but it was very clean and even had shampoo and body wash for use.
"Valerie was pretty good about responding to my texts promptly. The couple even offered me breakfast and asked me to join them for ice cream. I felt very cared for and at the same time quite independent. I enjoyed my stay very much and would recommend it!\"",,,,,

Even though we had difficulty to get to Boston and arrived hours after midnight, Valery was very kind to us and gave us access to her home which made us feel very welcome.

5940866,36531631,2015-06-29,32211233,Daniela,"The house was exactly what we expected, based on the description. It's a beautiful multi-story house in the wonderfully diverse East Boston. There is ample parking close to the house, and plenty of unique places to eat. The train ride (the T), was exactly as far as the listing said it was. Valerie & Jason were so patient with us and our arrival time (since we were driving) and we appreciate that they took time out to welcome us! The bed was so soft and comfy --- so perfect for a long sleep after our 24+ hour drive out there. Valerie & Jason were both exceptionally welcoming and have clearly put a ton of time and energy into making the space as relaxing as it is gorgeous. We appreciate all of the small details they had, including the towels (less for us to pack!), the map of Boston with details, and both taking the time to tell us about some of their favorite things to do here. It was also lovely getting to know Vienna, and hear about what she is learning in school! When I come back to Boston in the future, I definitely plan to contact these guys about staying in their home again! Thank you, thank you, thank you! You guys (and your home) is amazing!"
5940866,36785365,2015-07-01,33392160,Darlene,"\"Valerie made us feel very welcome. She made cupcakes from scratch for us!! Delicious. And she let us keep two whole lobsters in her fridge overnight to take to Hartford the next day. Her house is precious, and the location is great... only a few short blocks to the subway. We were in downtown Boston from her front door in about 35 minutes. The room was very comfortable, and clean, as was the bathroom (large, thick towels) and kitchen. Going downstairs to the bathroom was a very minor inconvenience for us, given the huge savings over a hotel room in the city. Overall, we enjoyed our stay (two nights) very much, and will definitely look her up when we return to Boston. She rates an \"\"A+\"\" with us. \""

Breakfast was great, and Jason gave us some great tips for the day around Boston before leaving in the morning. When we got back in the evening, we were able to have a great chat over a couple of drinks. If we ever visit Boston again, we'll certainly be back! :)"

The room was the perfect size for two people. Very comfortable bed, a little refrigerator that they had filled with waters prior to our arrival, and the little air conditioner was a great addition for our summer-time visit. The location is perfect for quick access to the airport. Very grateful that this was our first Air BnB experience."

Jason and Valerie are both up for great conversation and laughs.  If you need any suggestions about seeing the city or where to catch a bite to eat, these two know there way around Boston.  I was absolutely spoiled with a fantastic dinner from their neighbor Rufus, and a little after dinner drink to cap the night off. This will definitely be my go to when I visit Boston.  5 star experience!"

They were very friendly friendly and loved to have a chat which was great, they provided breakfast each morning which just made our stay in their house amazing, it was so convenient. The listing was exactly as described. The neighbourhood was very safe and in a convenient location, close to public transport, the airport and many convenience stores. I'd recommend Valerie and Jason's Airbnb to anyone, I'd love to visit again."

Gracious when we arrived and gave us a quick orientation to the bedroom and bathroom. We were there for 3 nights and we felt as though it was a home away from home. They even had breakfast for us everyday in the morning. On one morning, valerie even made delicious banana bread which we truly loved it. I highly recommend this to anyone going to boston. Would book again in a heartbeat."
5940866,41071560,2015-08-04,32410104,Viktoria,We stayed for 4 nights in Valeries place and she and Jason were the perfect hosts. The room and the whole house was very cosy and clean. They explained us where we should go in Boston and what we could do. Jason and Valerie are very friendly and they are both very good chefs. I would definitely recommend to stay in their place.

Das Zimmer war genau so wie es die Bilder gezeigt haben. Zudem war das Bad und Zimmer sehr sauber und wir haben alles vorgefunden, was wir gebraucht haben. Das Frühstück war sehr gut und es war schön währenddessen mit den beiden Gastgebern ins Gespräch zu kommen."

5940866,43766067,2015-08-22,6491569,Vivian,"Unfortunately we didn't get the opportunity to meet Valerie but Jason was very welcoming and his friends helped carry our luggage to the third floor where the room is. The room was lovely and exactly as pictured! A little inconvenient that the washroom is on the first floor but the bathroom is clean and the included breakfast is much appreciated as I am always hungry upon waking up, haha. I love fruit and was very grateful for the fruit available throughout the day. You can imagine how amazing a cold, thirst quenching slice of watermelon is after a hot, humid day! Jason is friendly and open to conversation, it was interesting to discuss cultural differences with him from his interactions with diverse cultures in his previous employment! His expertise in hotel management really shined in all the details of this listing, from the towels and hairdryer to bottled water and noiseless mini fridge. All in all this is a great place to book. The neighborhood may be a hit or miss in terms of how safe you feel based on what you are normally used to. Personally, we felt a little unnerved at night in the dark blackness, and the sidewalks are rather broken, but it's largely fine. We felt privacy in our room and we recommend this airbnb place to everyone!"

The description in this listing is very accurate.  The location,in particular,"is excellent; it's within walking distance to the T.

Very reasonable!\"",,,

5940866,46702681,2015-09-13,34816493,Gillian,"My husband and I spent two nights in Valerie and Jason’s lovely home.  They were excellent hosts and really made us feel at home.  The room was lovely, clean and light, with lots of nice touches that you don’t find elsewhere (toiletries, lots of towels, water and mini-fridge).  Jason gives an excellent introduction to Boston, complete with restaurant recommendations (which proved to be very good ones!).  The continental breakfast was great.  The house is in an excellent location – so close to the airport (without being troubled by aircraft noise) and a short walk to the T, which whizzes you downtown really quickly.  We also liked seeing and walking through the local neighbourhood.  Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others."

The room description was accurate. Our accommodation was very roomy and comfortable. Valerie and Jason keep their home beautiful and clean which adds to the enjoyment of staying with them.,,,,,
Jason recommended an excellent Mexican restaurant only a few minutes walk away. We felt safe in the neighbourhood  and there is a laundromat conveniently located on the next corner,parking in the street was no problem. There was some street noise but did not worry us too much. Boston is a beautiful city and the location of Valerie and Jason's home is a 10 minute walk to the metro station which is only two stops to downtown Boston.,,,,

The house was very clean and tidy; detailed and accurate advice on Boston and its sights was offered and free bottled water was provided in the room. The room is in the top floor and has air con. There are stairs to the room but this lazy man with a 50lb pack had no troubles.,,,,,
We found the houses links to both the City and to the airport very convenient and the area seemed safe. There is a serviced laundrette down the block should you feel the need.,,,,,

Die Gegend macht einen ganz guten Eindruck, ist aber nicht so nobel wie manch andere Viertel. Parken konnte ich gut in der Straße. Das Zimmer liegt im Dachgeschoss und ist genauso wie beschrieben. Vor allem das Bett ist wirklich sehr bequem! Das Badezimmer für den Gast befindet sich im untersten Stock neben der Küche und dem Wohnbereich. Jason und Valerie nutzen das Bad nicht selbst, man sollte aber wissen, dass der Gast auf dem Weg dort hin durch das Wohnzimmer muss und den beiden dort auch begegnet wenn sie zuhause sind."
In der Küche stehen Kaffee,Tee und kleine Snacks den ganzen Tag zur Verfügung. Auch im Badezimmer ist alles vorhanden: Handtücher,Shampoo,Duschgel,Fön,Haarspray....

The location was really convenient.  I found the bed and room very comfortable and there was a nice continental breakfast available in the morning.  Valerie and Jason were really nice and helpful with information and I would recommend it as a great home base for a longer stay in the city.

The room is clean and a large size, with enough room. All the essentials you may have forgotten to bring are provided. They also provide an very nice breakfast and we got treated to some delicious homemade muffins whilst staying which was a bonus. The other thing I will say maybe be a downside for some is that your bedroom is on the 3rd level and your bathroom is on the 1st, but we didn't mind too much.  If we are back in the area we would stay again!"

Auch haben sie (und ihre Tochter) uns Tipps gegeben, was wir in Boston anschauen sollen und uns eine Extraeintrittskarte, die sie noch hatten, gegeben."
Die Nachbarschaft war sehr dreckig,"laut und nachts \"\"sketchy\"\". Die Wohnung war allerdings sehr sauber und aufgeräumt. Der U-bahnstopp ist ca. 10 Minuten zu Fuss entfernt. Frühstück war Kaffee",Toast und Marmelade und etwas Selbstgebackenes von Valerie (für uns Bananennussbrot und etwas mit Erdnussbutter,beides sehr gut).

Our trip was an absolutely wonderful time in a very quiet and beautiful neighborhood in a spectacular house. Valerie and Jason were not there for the majority of our stay but were very prompt on giving instructions in order to get to the house, and get in. When finally able to meet, they both were so warm and welcoming and Valerie even prepared some delicious strawberry muffins! All I know, is that no matter what I am going for in Boston, I will definitely stay with Valerie and Jason again."

5940866,73200262,2016-05-07,38268564,Fiona,"We had a fantastic 4 night stay at Valerie and Jason's. They really do offer a 5 star air bnb experience - the room is just as pictured with a very comfy bed, the area is well located for both the airport and the city centre and the little extras they provide (towels, toiletries, breakfast) all help make the stay a great one, but what really makes this place stand out from other air bnbs we've stayed in is their hospitality - Valerie and Jason seem to really enjoy hosting; they're full of tips that help you discover bostons lesser known treasures (like Ciao pizza!), and the welcome we received on our first night set the tone for a really enjoyable visit. We would certainly return and recommend to anyone visiting Boston - thank you both!"
5940866,73762530,2016-05-10,68752156,Tricia,Valerie and Jason have a beautiful home.

The house is located about 10-15 minutes walking distance to the airport subway station. The commute to the historic center takes about 7minutes and a free bus services takes travelers from the subway station to the airport terminals. The house is beautiful and Valerie and Jason made us feel welcome during the whole time of our stay. The bed is really comfortable and the house super clean.

Their home was cozy and very clean. Guests should be able to climb stairs easily as the room is on the third floor. They provided plenty of towels, pillows, water bottles in our own mini fridge, an AC unit... It was great after a long day of walking a great city! We didn't get to stay very long on our multi-stop trip- but I would definitely recommend this Airbnb!"
5940866,81915410,2016-06-25,65622475,Charles,"Valerie was really nice and she made sure we had everything we needed while we were there. She is literally only a 10 minute walk from the train and we were able to come in and out as we pleased. She was also gracious enough to provide a couple of muffins to us every morning so that we had something to eat before we left every morning. The muffins were great, by the way!

Jason and Valerie gave us good advice,where to eat or to see Boston and even a map of Boston.,,,,
The house is close to the subway (7 minutes walk) and the neighborhood is nice.,,,,,
"Thanks a lot for a lovely week-end.\"",,,,,
5940866,86231760,2016-07-15,44653,Kristen,"Valerie and Jason were very welcoming!  They were very interesting and nice to talk to and made my stay easy and enjoyable.  They are pros at Airbnb and provided everything I needed (including an umbrella for unexpected rain) and ear plugs for the city and airport noise.  The room was comfortable, clean and private.  Of note, the two flights of stairs leading to the bedroom are steep, narrow at places and turn corners, making it difficult to bring heavy luggage up, so bring several small bags if you can, rather than one large. These same stairs must be traversed to use the bathroom two floors below (a bit precarious in the middle of the night, but they thoughtfully leave several lights on throughout so you aren't fumbling around in the dark).  If you are traveling for business (as I was), there is not a desk or table in the room.  I was offered the kitchen table to work at, which I used on one occasion, but it wasn't the best arrangement for me personally.  The location was convenient to the T as promised, with my only note being that if you have rolling luggage, it's quite a schlep up hill and over very uneven sidewalks to get to the house. There are not many restaurants or bars within walking distance, but Angela's Mexican restaurant 2 blocks away had great food (but not so great drinks).  All in all, if you are going to Boston and want to be outside of the city center and not in a hotel, but with easy access to downtown and surrounds for business or exploring, this may be a good choice with great hosts!"
5940866,88944992,2016-07-26,27693766,Lesley,Valerie and Jason have a beautiful home which is possibly the tidiest and cleanest place I've ever been!
The bedroom was very comfortable with an aircon unit with R/C,a fridge with water,earplugs,info on Boston (which sadly I didn't find until just before I left - so do look for it if you stay there) and lots of thoughtful little touches; and Valerie had left breakfast out for me as they were not at home for the first two of my 3 nights' stay.,,
"I'm so glad I got to meet them on my last evening in Boston! \"",,,,,
5940866,89806765,2016-07-30,19823146,Matt,"Valerie made us feel very welcome and the room, breakfast and advice made our stay in Boston comfortable and enjoyable.

5940866,91144659,2016-08-04,7479823,Elien,"We hadn't had such a great Airbnb experience for a long time.

Highly recommended."
5940866,91906770,2016-08-07,39536445,Seamus,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Valerie and Jason's. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Jason who led us to our room. The room is at the top of 3 flights of stairs and was a bit of a challenge with large luggage. He then spent some time talking us through the city of Boston and some activities and places he recommended we visit.
The room was lovely and thankfully there was AC as the weather was very hot and humid. One note about the AC,it was quite loud,although ear plugs were provided but may be something to consider if a light sleep,luckily we are not.,,
There was a breakfast offered every day and was an unexpected surprise. Valerie is a Baker and had fresh baked muffins made every day.,,,,,
"Overall a great start and would recommend to anyone.\"",,,,,
5940866,92539411,2016-08-09,45616745,Lun,"Verlaries home is very neat and tidy. She offers practical advices and the restroom shared with her daughter is also very clean. This is my first Airbnb experience and this is also a journey I took my mum with me. So I think that might be the reason why this didn't suit us very well. In the August is pretty warm and the air conditioner is too loud for a women over fifty. Because this house is well located near the airport train station (blue line), so it is on one hand very convenient, on the other hand the noise from the plane can hardly be ignored."
In a nutshell,"this is a good choice when you travel as young visitors. \"",,,,

My wife and I decided to surprise my parents with a trip to Boston and we were looking for a place to stay that would make our trip even more memorable.  This beautiful brownstone definitely delivered!  The location was amazing as it is centrally located to everything you want to do in Boston.  There are numerous T Stations within a few blocks that lets you get wherever you want to go in Boston!  If you have any security concerns, throw them out the window as this property is in a great location!  We even decided to walk back to the property from Fenway after the game one night (30 min. walk) and enjoy all the architecture Boston has to offer!  As for the property itself, it has its quirks but that’s what makes it truly unique!  We loved the exposed brick and small details that just showcased the character of this property.  The outside patio area was so refreshing in the morning’s before we embarked on our adventures and a retrieve in the evening's where we could relive the day's events.  We had some amazing food while in Boston but we fell in love with Mike & Patty's, which is around the corner from the property!  This was our breakfast spot each morning and everything we had was fantastic!"
Now on to Emily... she was so accommodating!  We had an early flight and arrived quite early to Boston.  I had requested an early check-in and Emily quickly obliged.  This was so great as we were able to drop off our luggage and enjoy the City immediately upon arriving!  Thank you again Emily!,,,,,
If you are wanting to live like a local for a short period of time,stay in a property with true character and be minutes away of the best that Boston has to offer,then book this beautiful brownstone today before someone else beats you to it!  We just hope we get a chance to stay here again in the future!!,,,
Thank you again Emily for making this Weekend a truly memorable experience for my parents,my wife and myself!  And Go Red Sox!!,,,,

It was so nice to share the home with my family and we were able to spend a lot of quality time with each other instead of staying in a hotel.  The home was very nice and looked like the pictures in the listing, which we all were happy about.  It was very clean and nicely decorated.  Also, the neighborhood was nice with restaurants and grocery stores close by if needed.  If we decide to come back to Boston I would not hesitate to request to stay in Javier's home again.

It was clean and had everything we needed.  It's located in a quiet typical Allston neighborhood.   It was close to the green line and a Star Market is a couple blocks down the street.  She provided a parking permit so I was able to park my rental car.   I have no complaints.   It's not a fancy place, but who needs that?   I would stay there again."

It was spacious and clean, not Luxurious but practical enough for a comfortable home. It was about two hundred metres to a market with various Asia foods and approximately six hundred metres away a Star Market. She provided a parking permit so I was able to park my rental car. The green line is just in front of the star market. It’s not very fast but I think it’s good enough, very convenient to where I want to go. I lived here for four days with my family, total five persons. I’ll book the same apartment again if I'm back in Boston with family members."

The living space, kitchen, bathroom and individual rooms are every travelers dream come true.  Todd makes you feel like your at home.  What I loved the most is that every time I wanted or needed something - Todd had already provided it.   (This has not been my experience at some Airbnb's before).  Ya Todd!   The neighborhood is safe, within walking distance to Harvard Square and Harvard Business School and also easy access to public transportation if you need it.   However, I highly recommend Uber - it's cheaper and faster and more entertaining."
If you want a superb place to rest your head,then Todd is your Host.   Easy access,delightful communication and may I say clean,"modern and hip accommodations.  \"",,

The house is a newer home (rare to find in Boston) with all the amenities you could want for a luxurious stay.  Todd has thought of everything and gone upscale across the board - turkish bath towels, super comfortable beds, beautifully decorated interior - we just felt so lucky to have found his home on Airbnb.  The neighborhood is very safe, and it's a beautiful walk along the river to Harvard Square.  We especially loved the new kitchen with everything we needed, and the large living room with a flat screen TV.  There's also free laundry in the basement (new machines) and a nice little deck on the side that's perfect for eating dinner on.  We give this house and host 5 stars for everything."

10266928,60721952,2016-01-26,49185028,Monica,"This place was in a beautiful area of Boston. The listing did describe it well, however we were surprised to find out we were staying on the sixth floor and the elevator is quite scary. We unfortunately had terrible neighbors. They ruined our first night there by throwing a college party next door. We contacted Inn Boston and they were helpful with the situation, but due to snow no one could come out. We did get refunded and they cannot control rude guests."
10266928,61953212,2016-02-09,28301307,Matthew,The place was fantastic; it was very well kept and with all amenities noted ready and available.

10266928,68348503,2016-04-04,24401293,Robert,"This is a great, mysterious old building in a residential/collegiate location and we sort of enjoyed our stay here. However, not as much as we had hoped. Our previous airbnb stays have been with privately managed units that included a few personal touches. These go a long way in creating a good experience. Inn Boston is apparently not of that mindset. We arrived late at night, and though I thought I had been proactive by grinding some coffee beans to bring so we could start our first day right, there was not a single coffee filter for the coffeemaker. (It also would have been nice to have a couple bottles of water in the fridge, but this was not entirely expected.) But how about no bar of soap or shower gel in the bathroom? I suppose we could have washed up with the dish soap from the kitchen, but instead we set out to find a market. Everything was closed except for a drugstore a long walk away, which did not have the coffee filters. And alas, two bath towels, one hand towel and one washcloth were not sufficient for two people over a three day stay.  Anyone planning to come here should expect to get their shins bruised on the hidden corners of the bed - more than once. And finally, if you are driving here you might want to bring your own pillows. Other than the management's lack of attention to detail this could be a nice place to stay."
10266928,81004349,2016-06-20,42763415,Daniel,We had a great 4 day stay at this apartment.

Plenty of space - nice high ceilings and sash windows - and we enjoyed the terrace at the back.  There is good bedroom/bathroom space downstairs; this is below ground level so there is less light here.  Peter was extremely helpful and responsive: we couldn't have wished for a better host.  Worth mentioning parking: this is central Beacon Hill so there is no street parking for visitors but the Boston Common underground parking is extremely convenient and not unduly expensive.

It was very comfortable for my 3 colleagues and myself and could easily accommodate at least 3 other guests. It was very clean, well-stocked and had a beautiful common space and kitchen for us to use in between our work commitments. It would also be a lovely place to stay as a tourist.  It is in a great location right off of Charles Street (which is populated with great little restaurants) and has a beautiful view onto the Common and easy access to many T-stops (including Arlington & Charles St). Peter and his family were very accommodating and made sure that we were comfortable during our stay. We would definitely return the next time we are in Boston!"

He made advanced arrangements to accommodate our requests, made sure the unit was well equipped, and allowed us to feel at home while renting part of his home. This location is UNBELIEVABLE! We could see the famous Mallard family and swan boats out our window. Steps to Charles St and 1 mile walk to everything we needed. We barely used public transport, which is about 8 min walk away. We walked to Newbury St, North End, the Esplanade, even the Children's Museum. Way better than staying in a hotel as a group of 3 adults and 3 kids."

Great location from the T, cosy neighborhood, spacious room and bathroom even though we squeezed in 3 persons on the first night, towels and linens were provided as well. The place looks so much better in real life and the bed is very very cosy. Pam always check with us if we knew how to get around Boston. I loved the short 15mins walk to Arnold Arboretum because the neighborhood is very charming. Because my room mate and I had a late night Greyhound bis to catch, they let us leave our luggage with them for the day while we explored downtown. Thank you very much for hosting us!!"

Pam was away but Sara was a gracious host and made us very comfortable. She helped us when asked with directions and suggestions and have us privacy the rest of the stay.

1803138,14043751,2014-06-10,3472865,Kailee,"My husband and I had a great experience staying at Sara and Pam's place when we were visiting Boston for a wedding. Arrival and key pickup were smooth and pleasant. During the weekend we had a chance to chat with both Sara and Pam, who are kind, friendly, and helpful people, and we loved their cat, Derby. The upstairs area where we stayed--bedroom and super roomy bathroom--was clean, comfortable, and stocked not only with basics such as towels and soap, but nice extras like snacks and a Keurig coffee maker. The house itself is quiet and peaceful, and there was definitely a sense of privacy and independence for our entire stay. We had access to the kitchen, though we ate every meal out and primarily just used the kitchen to grab glasses of water, which is of course essential. The only downside to staying in this area of Jamaica Plain was the blaring music out of car windows during certain parts of the weekend, and some other city noises, but this didn't bother us too much. The house isn't too far a walk from the Green St. T stop, so we used this (as well as Hubway bike share) to get into other parts of Boston. A couple cute cafes are on the way to the train, and we enjoyed these, as well as some other restaurants in downtown JP (along Center Street). And one of the nicest things about JP is surely all the natural spaces, like Jamaica Pond and the Emerald Necklace parks. We didn't get a chance to see the Arnold Arboretum, so we will surely have to come back sometime. Overall, I would say Sara and Pam's place is an amazing bargain, a great spot to anchor your trip to Boston, and not at all too far from the city center if you're willing to navigate public transit."
1803138,14105199,2014-06-11,7739,Cheryl,Sara and Pam are great hosts and offer a peaceful retreat from the city while being close to good restaurants and gardens and transit. The bed is so comfy with its soft pillowtop mattress. I slept very well. The snacks and Keurig coffee maker are a nice touch. Sara and Pam were okay with me leaving the luggage for the day the day I left so I could tour the city unencumbered. The Arboretum was lovely and Cafe Ula serves a mean mozzarella-fig sandwich. Derby the cat helped me feel at home by talking to me and letting me know what she wanted (to be let out and to be petted- I could help her only with the latter). It was a perfect stay and I hope their place is available when I return to Boston.
1803138,14188810,2014-06-14,14771199,Erin,We loved our stay with Pam and  Sara! The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and clean. The space is private and very quiet. The neighborhood is charming and we felt safe taking a  short walk to the subway  every day. Pam and Sara are great people willing to lend us guidebooks and answer our questions about the best places to eat and neat things to see. Would gladly stay with them again-highly recommend!! Thanks for a wonderful first air bnb stay!
1803138,14249937,2014-06-15,16402915,Katie,"Pam and Sara were wonderful hosts!! They were flexible, responsive and super friendly. The room itself was also lovely and was the only bedroom on the top floor and had an attached bathroom. It was a really nice space. I would definitely recommend staying with them and would stay there again in a heartbeat."
1803138,14459528,2014-06-19,16882441,Chuck,"My stay with Pam and Sara was my first airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been more pleasant! The property is in a classic Boston neighborhood, but the many updates made it feel in many ways like a brand new home: clean, comfortable, and inviting. I travel often and I'm much like Winston Churchill when he said, 'I am easily satisfied with the very best.' The bed was sleep-inducing, the room well-appointed, and the private bathroom put it over the top. It was spacious, new, clean, and had a powerful shower."
Pam and Sara were consummate hosts. Both were engaging and available when needed,but allowed for privacy. Their knowledge of the area is unmatched,and there were plenty of books and maps available for those times when they might not have known an area. Excellent hosts,great place,"great neighborhood. I'm fearful if I say more I may not be able to stay here again as it is likely to be (URL HIDDEN) it should be. Don't miss it if you have the opportunity.\"",
1803138,14724249,2014-06-24,4343462,Rachelle,"We stayed with Pam and Sara for a night as we passed through Boston for a day. The accommodations were wonderful--comfy bed, spacious bathroom, totally private space. We only got to meet our hosts briefly because we were out all day, but they are so sweet and helpful, giving us ideas of what to do and how to get around with public transit. We'll definitely be staying there again next time we go through."
1803138,20270566,2014-09-26,11958074,Ann,Sara and Pam's house is great! Really easy to get into the city! And they offer you everything what's needed! The bed is really comfortable and you have a huge bathroom for your own!
"We just stayed there for two short nights (late arrival and early delivery) but I would recommend it also for people who like to stay longer!\"",,,,,

1803138,20925021,2014-10-07,13418238,Marlene,"We needed a place for 1 night with easy access to the Longwood Medical area, and Pam & Sara’s condo turned out to be very well situated. Their building is located on a corner in a largely residential section, about 1 block from a busy major street. On-street parking was available but not exactly plentiful when we arrived in the late afternoon."
Pam and Sara were very personable and responsive hosts,replying to my prearrival inquiries in less than an hour and thoroughly answering all my questions.  They were very helpful in person,too,particularly with recommendations for places to eat and shop in the immediate neighborhood.,,
Their 3rd floor accommodations were clean and spacious; everything was in good working order,although the speed of the wireless internet seemed to vary a lot and was rather slow at times.  Unfortunately the bed turned out to be much softer than we’d like,and the street noise was quite a bit more than we’re used to (despite closed windows),so overall it wasn’t the most restful night for us.,,
Although we didn’t use the T,it would have been an easy walk to the nearest stop – we strolled past it on our way to a tasty breakfast the next morning at a nearby café.   By the time we checked out,most of the morning commuter traffic had subsided and it took us about 20 min to drive to Longwood,just as Pam & Sara had predicted.,,

We chose Pam & Sara's place because it came off as very welcoming... And surely it was! Pam & Sara are great hosts and they made themselves available in case we had any questions or concerns. The accommodation is very homey, clean, comfortable AND it is even private! The location is awesome as the neighbourhood has lots of little, fun cafés and shops and it is very close to public transit. Definitely would recommend!"
1803138,30245521,2015-04-19,30808575,Dave,"It's a little unfair that my first AirBnB was this great. It's gonna be a tough act to follow.  Nice and private, cool neighborhood, great location with easy access to the train to get around.  There was nothing more I needed."
1803138,30648411,2015-04-25,15812007,Bethany,"I stayed in Sara and Pam's home in JP for 2 nights. Our schedules didn't allow for us to actually meet, but they were available over text to answer any questions and they left a message for me on the door at my arrival. I loved the space - a large room on the third floor with a private resfloor - and the neighborhood was quiet with gorgeous Victorian style homes and cute cafes. The apartment is super close to the orange line and easy to get into the city center. I'd definitely stay again."

1803138,32528507,2015-05-19,30778064,Ahmed,Our first experience in Airbnb was great thanks to Pam and Sara! They were really helpful and great with our 9 month old baby boy. The house is amazing and the fact that we were on our own floor with a huge bathroom made our stay even better.
1803138,33184375,2015-05-25,33609535,Mohit,"We arrived in Boston in the afternoon at around 1 pm, and it took us 20 mins to reach Jamaica place using the subway. We got off at forest hills station and Pam & Sara's place is just a 5 min walk from this station, very easy to navigate and reach there, they had everything that they mentioned in the listing, absolutely fresh and clean and ready to use. Unless you want to stay in the main city overlooking the harbour this is a very good option, i would surely recommend it for a couple !!"
1803138,33441033,2015-05-28,1089634,Stuart,"Pam & Sara were wonderfully accommodating. The bedroom is as pictured, clean, roomy, with flat screen TV, comfortable. Large bathroom w/ shower/tub is excellent. Complete access to nice kitchen. House is beautifully restored and solid underfoot. Friendly cat appreciates a little love but not intrusive."
1803138,33620409,2015-05-30,12252583,Marion,"Pam & Sara are great hosts. They were not home, when we first arrived but everything was ready for us and there was also a map to find the local restaurants easily. The room was very nice and comfortable. And we liked that Pam & Saras place was not far from the metro. We enjoyed our stay!"
1803138,33873012,2015-06-01,30344434,Yolanda,"This location is in walking distance from shops, parks and public transportation. Pam and Sara were very gracious hostesses! I even spent time chit chatting with them and had the most delightful conversation. They were extremely helpful in finding local places to eat, directions on how to get around and even offered an umbrella because the weather forecast was calling for rain. The bed was comfy, the tv was big and had plenty of channels to choose from and the bathroom was huge! I will definitely stay there again!"
1803138,34178023,2015-06-05,10028694,Sarah,"Pam and Sara's place was both conveniently located and incredibly comfortable. The room was quite large on the top floor with its own private bathroom, which gave us a lot of privacy. On top of that, there was a large TV with cable and a coffee maker – just like a hotel but a million times cozier. Both Pam and Sara were incredibly kind and welcoming, accepting our stay very last minute and giving us free reign of their kitchen when needed. What a great stay!"
1803138,34706989,2015-06-11,4517621,Daniel,"Great stay in Jamaica Plain! Pam and Sara were very personable and very accommodating for our arrival and departure, and they are located just a few minutes' walk from the Boston subway Orange Line, which makes it fairly easy to access other parts of the city. The room is a good size, with a comfortable bed and an attached full bath."
1803138,35239009,2015-06-16,33784728,Bomi,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was a great one. Pam and Sara were friendly hosts and I felt at ease as soon as we got there. The room was well-lit and clean, the bed was comfortable, and our private bathroom was clean, spacious and well taken care of. The bedroom even had a coffee maker that I used to make coffee each morning. Ten minute walk to the Green Street T station. Loved the local coffee shop & bakery that was only about few blocks away. Heart of JP less then a 10 minute walk away. Overall it was a great experience and, I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Jamaica Plain area."
1803138,35486077,2015-06-19,27362059,Emmie,Pam and Sara have a lovely private room and bathroom that was perfect for our brief stay. They were gracious and friendly and great sources of info for local eating and activities. We would definitely stay here again!
1803138,36190351,2015-06-26,6289910,Stephanie,We felt at home from the minute we walked in.  The room was spotless and a decent size for the two of us.  The room is at the top of the house which was great for all parties involved as we felt we had our own space.  The en suite bathroom was lovely and spacious as well with towels included.  The Green St T station was only a 5-10 minute walk away.  The area of JP was a lively and diverse area with plenty of pubs/restaurants and quirky shops to suit any taste or budget.  JP was an affordable location close enough to get to downtown Boston (15-20 mins).  Pam and Sara are a lovely couple who were extremely helpful throughout the booking process and during our stay - we shared a drink and had a great evening.  Their cat Derby was very friendly and cute!
1803138,36901890,2015-07-02,35912002,Harnek,Our first stay with Airbnb at Pam and Sara's place was great. Very nice place and a total home feel.
Very convenient to anywhere in Boston on T. Plenty of parking in the neighborhood to leave the car there and explore the city.,,,,,
Pam and Sara were super nice and flexible in terms of checking in time  and suggesting things to do while there to get most out of our time. BTW I was in the city with my 10 year old daughter to explore the city and it worked as expected.,,,,,

1803138,37202232,2015-07-05,27012266,Stephanie,"Staying at Pam and Sara's was home away from home. This was mine and my boyfriend's second AirBNB experience, and while our last experience was so lovely as well, I really loved the privacy of having a floor practically to yourself and a connected bathroom, which was ENORMOUS and so nicely renovated and lovely. The room came with a large TV with cable, which my boyfriend and I don't have at home, and at times I had a little trouble tearing his eyes from the screen back to me, but we had such a comfortable stay. The room is MUCH bigger than in the picture, has tons of space and so private. Derby was a sweetheart also. Didn't have the pleasure of meeting Pam, regrettably, but Sara was very warm and accommodating, and did everything to make us feel at home and comfortable."

Everything was just as stated - nice, large room and bathroom:)  I loved the neighborhood and it was very easy to get every where using the T.  Pam and Sara even provided a Charlie Card for me to fill and use - great idea!   I highly recommend staying here!"
1803138,37961241,2015-07-12,31331424,Mary,Pam and Sara were great with their communications. They responded promptly to all emails and texts. Morning of our arrival they contacted us to let us know that they were going out to breakfast and would leave they key for us. Met Pam in the afternoon and she answered every question about Boston and gave the best advice about taking the subway instead of the car. The subway was walking distance from their place and saved us a ton of aggravation and parking expense while spending the day in Boston. Room was as described and perfect for our overnight stay. Would stay with them again!
1803138,40642792,2015-08-01,38296476,Diana,"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was great! Just as described, we had a nice bedroom with a huge bathroom en -suite.  The room was on the top floor so we had our own space.  The house was 5 min walk from T (Orange line, Green Street) and it took us about 10 -15 min to get into the city center. Pam and Sara provided us with all necessities, including Keurig coffee maker with K-cups.  There was also a  flat screen TV, AC, and a wireless internet. They have a lovely cat Derby that visited us, but was not intrusive.  Unfortunately we did not meet Pam and Sara in person as they were away (they had to leave due to family circumstance), but they were great with their communications. We had no problem finding the house and getting into it using lock box, as well as using free street parking. They even left some recommendations about the neighborhood and good places to eat (which we used). We stayed in-touch until our departure and Pam was updating us regularly about their plans.  Although we never met in person,  Pam's communication was so caring that I felt like part of the family. I really hope that next time we are in Boston we can stay with Pam and Sara and meet them in person."
Thank you,"Pam and Sara!\"",,,,

We were able to park our car on the street for free and use the subway system, with a stop only minutes away from their home. We did not have much contact with Pam and Sara as we were out most of the time, but the few times we did chat, they were helpful, warm and fun to speak with.

Das Zimmer und das angrenzende Bad sind sehr grosszuegig geschnitten und wirklich gemuetlich.

1803138,46290977,2015-09-09,28730622,Babs,"I stayed at Pam and Sara's place for a couple of nights during my visit to Boston. Not only was this my first trip to the city but also my first Airbnb experience and both Pam and Sara couldn't have been more helpful. Bar has been set high for any other stays I will have elsewhere. From the pre-booking time, when I emailed them with questions to my departure, Pam and Sara were accommodating and when I arrived, I discovered that both girls were gluten free and Pam gave me a few suggestions of where to go for food. I also got a few ideas of places to visit, in addition to the ones I had listed."
They offer their guests the use of a Charlie card which is cheaper than the Charlie ticket. In the bedroom,which has a comfortable double bed and a large private bathroom,you find maps and guide books,for even more ideas on visiting the town.,,
On the day of departure,I was able to leave my bag in the house and collect it before my train was due.,,,,

We appreciated all the tips and recommendations during our stay, and wished we had stayed longer to enjoy more of the sights of Boston and its surrounding towns. Their home is in a walkable area and about 5-7 minute walk to the T. There are several parks, cafes, and restaurants within walking distance, not to mention the Sam Adams Brewery tour. Their home is warm and comfortable. We loved meeting Pippi! The room was a lot larger than shown in the picture.

Pippie their dog is very friendly and quiet. I don't think I ever heard her bark. When I arrived,Pam and Sara were not home. I made my way up the stairs to a very clean and welcoming room. It does look exactly like the picture. The bed is very comfy,and having cable is a plus!,,,

We didn't have much interaction during our stay other than getting references for sites to see and advice on getting around. They were very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to where to go and how to use the subway. They also provided us with a bus pass that was refillable which discounted the cost.,,,,,

We agree with all the positive things that were said about the place, but there are two things for the guests to pay attention to. First, there are 42 steps leading from the road where you park to the room."
Second,on hot summer days it's important to ask the hosts to switch on aircondition (which works very well),"because it's central. The hosts will do it without any problem.\"",,,

My bedroom was big, bed was comfy, and there was desk for doing work. If you like hearing the birds chirp, there is a tree right outside the window. Wifi was fantastic; FaceTime never looked better. Neighborhood is totally hipster/young prof/startup vibe, which was perfect. BCEC is a 15 min walk easily down D Street, and I had my own key to come and go as I pleased. Apt building is quiet for doing work. I would stay here again if I was attending another conference at BCEC."

3415033,35268151,2015-06-16,7601059,Shane,"This unit is AMAZING.  Very spacious, updated, neat and clean.  Great location.  This should actually be listed under a private room listing as this is not an entire home, but a rather a shared 2bd/2ba unit.   I had a private room and bath but share apt with the owner (perhaps I missed this point while reading this listing).   With that being said, I never ran into Donny but corresponded with him via text.  He is very nice and wanted to ensure my stay was great."
3415033,36130232,2015-06-25,21777371,Ibrahim,"Donny was a great host. He was very flexible with my early morning check in time. He communicated very clearly and provided everything I needed to have a comfortable, worry-free stay. Will return next time I'm in the area for a conference."
3415033,38347173,2015-07-14,16775292,David,I was in Boston for a conference and found Donny and Chris's listing after my hotel rez was botched.  What a wonderful find!
They are great hosts and made sure I knew where everything was and how it worked,and gave me a list of some of their favorite restaurants,too.  They were headed out for the weekend so I had the place to myself.  (I wasn't there much due to meetings,etc.),,
Their home is everything that is described...super clean,well appointed,and very comfortable.  I especially liked the secure entrance.  There's a small children's park next door if you want to sit outside.,,,
It's very quiet at night and I honestly didn't hear another person in the four days I was there.,,,,,
I found two breakfast diners within a four block radius that were both great so an easy walk in the morning was a great start to the hectic  conference days.,,,,,
Transportation is stunningly easy...I didn't have a car.  There are tons of Uber drivers available and I didn't have to wait more than 4 minutes or so for them to arrive.  The T station is nearby as well.,,,,,
"Two thumbs up for this room!\"",,,,,
3415033,43544586,2015-08-20,40221774,睿斌,The host is very helpful during my stay in his home. He is willing to provide what I need. He is very thoughtful and makes me feel comfortable in his home. I had a great time visiting Boston and staying in his home.

3415033,52527204,2015-10-30,15439718,Harshvardhan,"Gorgeous apartment with an amazing view in an up and coming area of Boston. Donny and co were amazing hosts leaving no stone unturned in providing a space full of comfort and relaxation. Also very close to conference venues without any of the commercialism. Seriously, pick this space if only to see the spectacular view from their living room window and for wonderful conversation."
3415033,53085417,2015-11-04,47518642,Daniel,"Great place to stay. It's just as described, an awesome loft-style apartment with a furnished room. The location is pretty convenient, both to the convention center area (walkable) and public transit to go elsewhere. Donny and Chris are great hosts and made sure I had everything I needed. They'll give you lots of suggestions if you want it and are fun to talk to, or they'll give you space to do your own thing (which I needed to do because I was here on work). And they give some of the best directions so their place was easy to find."
3415033,59180848,2016-01-07,52885434,Chase,"Donnie and Chris were terrific hosts and even better people! The entire stay was seamless, the whole place was clean and beautiful, and I would definitely stay there again!"

2947662,13259039,2014-05-23,15430518,Mark,It was really great working with Lev. He was extremely helpful and accommodating during the entire process.
I was renting the space for a client and he was very happy and comfortable at Lev's penthouse. The location's very close proximity to the Red Line was a big plus. Lev made everything very easy and clear for both the client and myself.,,,,,

We had a great time staying at Lev's place. The location was absolutely perfect and the house met our needs. We were provided with everything we needed and were able to rest comfortably, much better than staying in a hotel."
2947662,16069902,2014-07-21,15515996,Diane,Very comfortable 2 bd with a great location. A few minutes walk to great restaurants and the Boston commons.
2947662,16617215,2014-07-30,10051724,Jeppe Sabroe,"Lev's place is excellent. This pretty much sums up this review. You will simply not find a better place in that location (which is the best in Boston). It comes at a price of course, but it was worth it for us. TIP: If you're looking for food late at night near Lev's place, then eat at the tavern on Cambridge St."

2947662,22600368,2014-11-10,657884,Perry,"Lev is an amazing host.  From his detailed to do list in the area to his overall hospitality (including fresh fruit and cold beverages available to us when we arrived), this was a great rental at a very inexpensive price.  You couldn't ask for a better location.  Quiet and safe neighborhood had plenty of available amenities."
2947662,22844941,2014-11-16,22548244,Allison,Lev's place is in an awesome location! Very cute street that is right in the middle of everything. He was very hospitable and the place was clean :)

2947662,28868998,2015-03-31,26421045,Murissa,"Lev's apartment was the perfect location for us during our stay. My sister, boyfriend and I traveled to Boston for the first time and decided to stay at an AirBnB apartment rather than a hotel. We ended up spending less because we could easily walk everywhere. Lev also graciously left us use of his breakfast cereals and fruit. We could also use anything in the fridge so long as we replaced the items."
The apartment itself was very comfortable and clean. All the photos of the interior are accurate to the listing.,,,,,
The neighbourhood is very unique and old with brick streets and historical places of note all around us. There's a grocery store,a pub around the corner for great local beers and delicious food and we walked to the Freedom Trail within 5 minutes. I would highly recommend Lev's apartment for your stay in Boston.,,,,

2947662,29164031,2015-04-05,26273708,Susan,"The location is perfect and overall the apt is pleasant.  Few things one should know:  building is a walk up to the 4th floor, narrow stairs.  Beds are against the wall.  Otherwise description on point."
2947662,29841807,2015-04-13,16772469,Susan,Lev is a great host- super easy to coordinate with and excellent in every way to make us feel at home. The apt was exactly as stated and amenities are wonderful. I would highly recommend Lev and this apt to anyone. Airbnb had in mind hosts like Lev as the exemplar for the business.
2947662,30377630,2015-04-21,8532014,Michael,"Four of us recently stayed at Lev's place for 4 nights over the Boston Marathon weekend. What we loved specifically, apart from everything:"
- Location: Proximity to good restaurants,Whole Foods,pharmacy,the T. Everything felt accessible.,,
- Noise level: was very low. I almost had to make noise to feel comfortable.,,,,,
-Access & instruction: everything was laid out clearly,and potential concerns were addressed before they could ever become problems. Lev spelled everything out crystal clear.,,,,
-Amenities: Has everything you'd want & expect of a hotel as far as towels,toiletries,even little creature comforts like chocolates & water.,,,

2947662,30608194,2015-04-25,1936096,Willie,Lev was great - everything he told us was completely accurate. He put some milk and OJ in the fridge for us before we arrived and even some chocolates on the bed. Nice touches. The place was clean and in a great location for us. Really enjoyed walking around Beacon Hill and would def recommend.
2947662,31071707,2015-05-01,3635463,Mario,"Lev is absolutely correct when he mentions the location of his place! You're right in the middle of it all! Great bars and restaurants are all within walking distance, as is Boston Common, Freedom Trail, North End, New England Aquarium, Boston Harbor, etc. And there is a Starbucks right around the corner from the apartment :) Lev answered all my questions and made sure I felt super comfortable with everything. The beds are comfy, the place is warm, the shower is hot... All in all this is a fantastic place to stay!"
2947662,31341494,2015-05-04,29100228,Heather,Lev was an amazing host and his place was just as described. We couldn't have picked a better centrally located place that enabled us to walk everywhere. He accommodated us with an early check in and a late check out. He even treated us with a bottle of wine with a sweet note and chocolates on the bed. I would highly recommend Lev's place and would love to stay there again.
2947662,32114963,2015-05-14,1273509,Cait,Lev was a great host. We had access to the things in his apartment. He accommodated late check-out and even moving some furniture so we could fit a baby crib. Place was in a great location with easy access to the heart of Boston.

2947662,32815624,2015-05-22,29185511,Ziqing,"The apartment is located on a quite and beautiful street and is quite accessible from the subway station and in a walkable distance to the Boston Common. Lev also warmly provided us cereal and orange juices. The apartment is on the fourth floor, and so future guests with lots of baggage need to be prepared for a tough climbing. Laundry in the basement is not perfectly clean and a little bit inconvenient."
2947662,33441882,2015-05-28,30732279,Katy,"The apartment is in the most convenient place you could ask for. Walking distance to the freedom trail, parks, Backbay, waterfronts and attractions. Lev's apartment is presented beautifully and very clean with everything you could need (plus Netflix anf HBO if you want to chill and watch movies!) as well as easy access to the lockbox for smooth check in/out."
Lev was very kind,"easy to contact and quick to respond making our stay in Boston really great.\"",,,,

2947662,34287527,2015-06-07,18250915,Maria,Lev was the perfect host. He gave us a lot of very helpful information about the apt. and about the area. We felt right at home.
What can one say about the location...we were able to walk to many of Bostons wonderful sights. There were plenty of great places to eat,all within walking distance.,,,,
I'd recommend his place for anyone who is staying just for the weekend or for a whole week or two.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2947662,35311457,2015-06-17,29048403,Jesus,"Desde el principio Lev fue un anfitrión muy atento, respondiendo rápidamente a cualquier consulta o reclamación. Hubo un malentendido por nuestra parte cuando elegimos este apartamento, al creer que la capacidad de 6 personas que figura en la información se debía a que aparte de las dos camas dobles de las habitaciones, el sofá que hay en el salón era sofá-cama, lo que era lo que buscábamos porque a pesar de ser solo 4 personas, nuestra hija y nuestro hijo son ya mayores y preferian dormir separados. Al ver cuando llegamos que no era así, le hicimos saber a Lev nuestro malestar, pero él nos dijo que cuando son más de 4 personas tiene una cama hinchable, que nos ofreció inmediatamente sin sobrecoste alguno."
Son de agradecer detalles al recibimiento como fruta,leche o zumo y otros en la nevera (estos últimos a reponer,pero que  hacen más cómoda la llegada) y bombones.,,,
En cuanto al apartamento,lo mejor es la ubicación,a pocos minutos del Common y la flexibilidad en el horario de entrada con el lock-box. Lo peor,la subida de 4 pisos con 4 maletas por la empinada y sucísima escalera,que da una impresión horrible. El apartamento en sí estaba limpio aunque no tanto como se espera de alguien que te pide que dejes tus zapatos fuera,encontrando algunas baldas con polvo acumulado.

2947662,35574260,2015-06-20,12356942,Laura,The best thing of the apartment is location. Walking distance from most tourist spots. Good restaurants and bars near the apartment.

The apartment's location was perfect,next to Boston Common,grocery stores and as far as I can tell we had no troubles to find items for personal care or something to eat.,,,
When we got inside,everything was clean with comfortable accommodations,a huge TV and bonus points to the owner for leaving fresh fruits and chocolates to his guests.,,,

2947662,36745499,2015-06-30,28723480,Karina,"Lev is the consummate host. He is responsive, considerate, and accommodating (within reason).  This was my first time to Boston and my first time using Airbnb. I had a different booking and that host cancelled on me the morning of my arrival with no explanation! I was stressed to say the least. I found Lev's place the day of my arrival and he was super understanding.  He even got us some milk, orange juice, and bananas since he knew we were arriving super late. Such a kind gesture! He made himself available to us via text throughout my stay and remained responsive to my inquiries. His apt is clean & centrally located with a Hubway station right across the street and two equidistant train lines nearby.  In the end both the customer support staff at Airbnb and Lev turned a potential nightmare into a dream. Thanks again Lev!!"

2947662,42735119,2015-08-15,20044781,Valerie,"Lev was very responsive to our questions before and after we arrived, and gave us great suggestions about family activities in Boston.  Our plane was delayed and we showed up at his apartment at 1:30 am with two hungry kids and not much to feed them. Lev had left cereal, milk and fruit for us, though, which was just what we needed!  His place is perfect for exploring Boston.  We were able to walk everywhere -  the Science Museum, the Duck Boats, the Freedom Trail, the Boston Commons.  And Beacon Hill is a lovely place to enjoy a walk or a jog.  The beds were very comfortable, and if your kids are like ours and need a little space to sleep, the sofa is comfortable, too.  Air conditioning worked great.  And the roof is a lovely place to have a cup of tea or glass of wine.   We would definitely stay here again."

The place itself is exactly as described, although I don't think Lev does justice to just how central his place is! Easy walking distance from most sights, and located around the corner from beautiful Beacon Hill and the Boston Commons. Lev was the consummate host, welcoming us with an impeccably clean apartment, breakfast goods, and small thoughtful touches (including chocolates on our clean towels, Boston guidebooks on the coffee table, and his own personal restaurant recommendations - which did not disappoint!). He was also very responsive! Would definitely stay here again, if Lev would have us!"

He was quick to respond to my texts when I had questions. The location is PERFECT. It worked out really well for us. You must be physically capable of climbing and descending 4 flights of stairs. I loved it because it was the only work out I could fit in on my trip, but if you are injured or disabled, you will have difficulty with the stairs."
2947662,52481571,2015-10-30,40531499,David,"Overall, place was great! Good central location, very clean place and everything was ready for us and easy instructions for access. Also left us fruit and food for when we arrived."
2947662,53023382,2015-11-03,47399612,Debbie,"Had a great time in Boston! The apartment was perfect for our needs. Although there were stairs to climb, we were okay with that because that bit of extra exercise allowed to enjoy Boston's great food without guilt! The bed in the larger bedroom was very comfortable and cozy. Lev (and his brother when Lev was out of town) were accessible and answered all questions promptly. Everything from reserving his apartment to accessing the apartment was flawless. Thanks for the great accommodations Lev!"
2947662,53337598,2015-11-08,44267855,Amanda,"Amazing experience to say the least. His apartment was located perfectly in Boston. Close to most of the sight seeing, shops and restaurants, we sometimes preferred to walk instead of Uber. Everything in the apartment was the way he described but better. Beds were extremely comfortable and couch as well. Had fresh linens and extra towels for my stay. He also greeted us with complimentary fruits and other items. He was very professional, and offered a quick response to all our questions. Will book again with him in the future. Thank you Lev."
2947662,54722653,2015-11-23,25527866,Mary,"This is the second time I have stayed with Lev. He was an awesome host! He even let us check in early at short notice when a flight got changed. His place is spotless, fresh fruit, juice and milk provided, and a great location!"
2947662,55370139,2015-12-01,1840465,Christine,"Lev's place was extremely clean and conveniently located to everything.  He provided clear instructions about the apartment and offered guidance with local transportation and nearby stores (Whole Foods and CVS are across the street).  The neighborhood is wonderful, and we loved being able to walk to anywhere.  I would definitely stay here again."
2947662,55700489,2015-12-04,3434328,Petya,"I would recommend his place to anybody who wants to be in great location in Boston. Convenience location ,right in down town 5 min away from Charles st. and Common Park. The building is really cute and small and has this great roof top. Absolutely enjoy my stay at this place.:)"
2947662,55886305,2015-12-06,36927295,Maria,"Lev was really nice. We were going to another Airbnb but it got cancel, we message him and he replied instantly, and made the process of Instant Booking really easy. The apartment is really nice and has everything you may need, and is also located in a nice area with some cafes and restaurants."
2947662,57806570,2015-12-29,33597661,Kathleen,"This location is spectacular! We were able to walk everywhere in Boston (Freedom Trail, downtown, theater district, Boston Common, TD Garden, etc.). When the weather got bad we summoned an Uber, and there always seemed to be one within 5 minutes. Honestly, we couldn't have asked for a more perfect location."
The size is perfect for three people and it was a joy to be able to make some meals rather than go out all the time.,,,,,
The only drawback would be for people who are not in physical shape to walk up and down four flights of stairs. The rooftop deck is up an additional flight of stairs. This was not an issue for us,but it is worth mentioning to potential renters.,,,,
Our host,Lev,was attentive,responsive,"and professional. He made sure we were comfortable and was available to answer all questions. I would highly recommend this place. \"",
2947662,61936905,2016-02-09,45407811,Jeremiah,"Lev is such a hospitable host. When I inquired him how to work the TV, he came over to the apartment to help us out at 11pm. Lev is physically always there to help you, and he is willing to help at all times. All the aspects that people look for when looking for a place to stay, such as location, facility, etc are all satisfacotry here."
2947662,64717732,2016-03-06,31219644,Akriti,"Great apartment! As soon as I checked in I could see how cute this place was. The wall colors are bright and inviting, the TV has all available (Internet) channels, the views are nice if you like red bricked buildings (and there are more panoramic views on the terrace). It was a quiet and safe neighborhood."
The thing to note is its proximity to the Public Gardens,Copley Plaza. There are many things within walking distance. The apartment was clean and ordered when I arrived,and there were clear instructions left by Lev regarding wi-fi and kitchen use. In terms of communication,Lev was around electronically for any doubts/questions I may have had,and periodically contacted during checkin/checkout times.,
"Definitely recommend! \"",,,,,

Great location and very clean. The ONLY downfall was that it was on the fourth floor and has no elevator ( We had heavy suitcases)... but honestly after the first day- we did not care and would stay there again if we could!!"

2947662,68422800,2016-04-04,47614349,Sharon,"Lev is a great host!  Communication with him was timely and his responses to our queries were very quick.  He provided us with all the information we would need and made us feel extremely welcome in his apartment, even though we didn't get to meet him in person.  The apartment is spacious, clean and a relaxing place to come back to after a day's sightseeing.  Little touches like leaving us milk and fresh fruit were appreciated, as well as providing bathroom essentials.  The Beacon Hill neighbourhood is full of history and very atmospheric.  The apartment is only a few minutes walk from a train station and there are a number of bars and restaurants within a short walk, as well as a fantastic supermarket just across the street.  All in all, an amazing stay in a beautiful city!"
2947662,69303032,2016-04-10,64561555,Patrizio,"Lev is a great host, both proactive in providing all the instructions and information to make our stay easy and responsive to our needs and questions. The apartment is very nice and VERY clean. It felt like being home. The location is amazing and the wholefoods on the other side of the street has high quality food. The only caution is that the apartment is on the fourth floor of a building and the staircase is pretty tight and steep, it just requires a little bit of effort to take the luggage up and down. We actually enjoyed the setting and didn't have any problem with it. overall, we loved it. Thank you Lev"
2947662,70237024,2016-04-17,46504683,Charles,This city retreat provided charming comfort and all the amenities anyone could need. It' s located in the best area of town -  convenient to freedom trail. the city's best restaurants and the T-line transit system. Lev was kind and attentive and helped make our trip to Boston  a pleasant and comfortable experience. We felt totally at home in his downtown hideaway!
2947662,70766955,2016-04-20,54347690,Jessica,Apartment was conveniently located to several restaurants and a T stop near Mass General! Whole foods within walking distance for cooking your own food!

The apartment is in the perfect location in Boston; a few steps from Cambridge St (Whole Foods); 5 mins from Boston Common; MGT 5 mins away. You couldn't pick a better spot to explore this historic city. Lev was a great host; communicative and responsive. The apartment was spotless, with access to the most amazing roof terrace and everything you could need on hand. We'll definitely be staying here again when we come back to Boston. Thank you!"

2947662,73664601,2016-05-09,54401286,Nicola,"Lev is an absolutely amazing host.  He was incredibly responsive before our visit, during our stay (and even afterward as we left behind an item and he kindly mailed it to us).  He is very accommodating and thoughtful.  My daughter was recovering from surgery, and he even delivered cupcakes one night!  His apartment is spotless and well stocked.  He had fresh fruit and milk waiting for us on our arrival.  And the apartment is frankly spacious for Beacon Hill.  The beds are so comfortable.  I miss the bed in his second bedroom now that I am back home.  And the location cannot be beat.  Beacon Hill is the most beautiful neighborhood in Boston.  And the apartment is right across the street from WholeFoods, Starbucks and lots of smaller restaurants.  And it is a very close walk to MGH, the Charles Street T stop (metro) as well as all of Boston.  We travel to Boston frequently, and I will always check with Lev first to see if his apartment is available.  We could not have been happier."
2947662,75605658,2016-05-22,66905221,Bryan,"Everything about this place is perfect: walkability, proximity to the T, neighborhood food, bars and groceries. Parking is not fun, but that's just Boston. Lev was a great host and made sure we had everything we needed."

2947662,76803438,2016-05-29,11232351,Magni,"Lev's place was great and as advertised.  I did not have much need for interaction with him but he was very responsive and helpful when I did.  He has three AC units in the house in the bedrooms and living room which was great.  The location is perfect and you can easily walk to historic Charles street, MGH or Boston Common.  Even Quincy Market is only a 10-15 minute walk.  It is near the red line T so easy access to Harvard or MIT or to connect almost anywhere including the airport.  I'd definitely stay there again."
2947662,82186530,2016-06-26,33156747,Yair,"Lev has been absolutely amazing!!! The apartment is located in the Center of the city, close to pretty much everything. We were 6 people staying and it felt larger enough to all of us!! Even though we hadn't have the pleasure of meeting Lev, he had everything ready for us when we arrived and was super fast at answering all of our questions. Súper recommended!!!"

2947662,93959181,2016-08-14,2127409,Bettina,"Lev's place was perfect for our trip to Boston. The location was very central and easy walking distance to most anything we did-10 minute walk to Boston Common, 15 minute walk to the North end, and a quick metro to Fenway. Lev was extremely hospitable and provided a smooth checkin/check out process. Communication was on point, he was extremely timely with his responses. Thanks again Lev for allowing us to stay in your apartment, it was perfect :)"

The neighborhood is a historic district with lots of cafes,shops and eateries. His apartment within minutes of 2 of my favorite cafes in all of Boston,lots of great parks and gorgeous tree-lined,brick and brownstone streets.,,
The apartment itself was sparkling clean with luxe amenities,towels and bedding. The style and aesthetic was crisp,white and minimal. Kitchen appliances and bathroom were all brand-new,stainless steel,tech-savvy and gorgeous. It was full of natural light,with large windows overlooking local gardens and the neighborhood streets.

5885130,35662996,2015-06-21,20706827,Melissa,"My daughter and I stayed at Carlos' beautiful, spacious 1-bedroom apartment in Boston and absolutely loved it. Carlos was attentive and communicative, very thoughtful about making sure there were no loose ends. We were met at the apartment, where there were clear written instructions on how everything worked. Even the shower fixtures at labels so we wouldn't get drenched with cold water by accident! The apartment is in a wonderful location, the South End. We walked everywhere we needed to go. I am coming back for sure!"
5885130,37737769,2015-07-10,11761530,Lorraine,Communication with Carlos was always easy and friendly. He responded to my questions right away. His condo in the South End was upscale as his listing said and perfect for my husband and myself. As the owner of a B&B I am very detail oriented - Carlos exceeded my expectations.
When I asked him if there was a shopping cart in the condo for the three block walk to the nearest little grocery store... his response was 'no,but I will have one there by the time you arrive' - and he did!,,,,
I am very fussy about cleanliness and a bit of a snob about my bed,bedding,etc... The place was immaculate,the kitchen had the same high quality appliances we have at home and the bed and European style bedding were possibly better than mine at home.,,
The South End is full of wonderful cafes and restaurants,old brownstones and parks. It is very walkable - there are 'T' stops nearby but you can walk to Chinatown,Boston Common and Beacon Hill if you enjoy walking.,,,
"Thank you Carlos for making our family reunion so great!\"",,,,,
5885130,50177195,2015-10-10,22243280,James,"Carlos made us feel welcome and met us at the apartment to give us a detailed tour of the property and explanations of how everything worked. He not only provided us with some food for breakfast but also provided recommendations of nearby places to eat. The flat was clean and tidy, and looked like the photos, with basics and essentials provided. The house instructions left in the apartment were detailed and easy to follow. Carlos checked in with us a couple days later by email to see if all was still well. He was flexible about the time we checked-out (since we had a night flight that was useful). Overall the apartment was lovely, and we liked sitting in the solarium watching birds flitting about the trees. It was an easy walk to the Orange Line, but the Silver Line (bus) was just around the corner going to Downtown Crossing or South Station. We found getting in/out of the city centre was really easy (and had a weekly MBTA pass). Getting there from the airport was straightforward.  The area was reasonably quite and felt safe enough for a big city. There was a 'Foodies' supermarket a few blocks away (while not the cheapest had the benefit of being close). It was a short walk to the Museum of Fine Art (highly recommended). The apartment appeared as the photos,  and the solarium is a great place to have breakfast or an evening meal, the bed was very comfy. The appliances in the kitchen were excellent and easy to use."
Overall,highly recommended if you don't need to be right downtown.,,,,

Communication with Carlos was easy and straight forward.  Janice met us at the door and showed us in.  The pictures do not do justice to the space.  It is very spacious for a one bedroom townhouse!!!,,,,,
The amenities were perfect and the fully equipped kitchen was nice to prepare our own meals.   We loved the South End neighborhood.  There are many excellent local restaurants and Flour just a block away became our breakfast ritual.  Stella was nice for a group lunch with some fellow runners.  Boston Chops was a fabulous way to celebrate running 26.2 miles.,,,,,
The 3/4 mile walk through the neighborhood to get to Back Bay (Boylston,Newbury,Hynes Center,etc.) was serene and just the right distance.  It's not that much further to Fenway to watch the beloved Red Sox.  Between Uber,the bus and the T we had no problem getting around town.  The evenings were pretty quiet for being in a city.,
The solarium was quite inviting during the mid afternoon and my wife took full advantage of the cozy environment during the brisk spring days.,,,,,
We would highly recommend in this lovely townhouse and will try to book upon our next visit to Boston.,,,,,
Btw,the bottle of wine upon arrival and the Pandora stations were a very nice touch!,,,,

The location of her place was very accessible about a 10-15 minute walk from the commuter rail station and less that 5 minutes from the bus to the nearest T station. There are a few convenience stores nearby if needed and a few places to get food. As a female traveling alone I don't think I would want to be out too late by myself,but that's most places.

Chris was just a terrific host and his apartment is adorable.  He was very communicative and responsive when I had questions, provided excellent directions on how to get there, and made it easy to get keys and then to return them when I left.  The apartment is attractive, well-appointed and very clean and the neighborhood is great (and only a 10 minute walk from my conference venue!).  Trader Joe's is right near by and Chris's kitchen is pretty well-equipped for basic cooking and has excellent, new appliances.  (My one tiny quibble would be the lack of a coffee maker, but there were multiple places to get coffee a stone's throw from the front door.)"
When Chris had to stop by the apartment during my stay,he let me know well in advance and very graciously offered to stand me to lunch if I were going to be around (I was giving a presentation at the time so it worked out).

11462476,69616760,2016-04-11,26479510,Carol,"Cute and clean apartment in a great location. Was able to walk everywhere from the apartment. Chris' instructions to get in were easy enough to follow. Found parking in a garage located a couple blocks away, rather than trying to drive aimlessly looking for street parking."
11462476,69943300,2016-04-15,30657790,Naomi,"Christopher was great, holding our reservation even though we had difficulty with getting my credit card to work. All the arrangements worked out smoothly. The place was great! The apt itself was clean, well kept  and nicely decorated. the appliances newish and in great working order. The location was really great, close to the T, dinning and cute shops."
11462476,71650873,2016-04-27,52608673,Melissa,"This apartment worked great as a place to stay while on vacation for a few days. It was quiet, comfortable, and reasonably clean, and the wifi was some of the fastest I've ever seen. The friend I was staying here with opted to sleep on the couch instead of trying to split the bed, and she said it was comfortable to sleep on. We were a short walk to the T and a reasonable walk to museums, restaurants, and some really cute coffee shops. The corner market a few yards away was great for grocery essentials, too. I didn't have to contact Christopher for anything while I was staying here, so I can't speak to that, but he was very prompt in answering messages during booking, and allowed us to drop off our luggage prior to checkin so that we could start exploring the city while we waited for the apartment to be ready. Would stay here again next time I'm in the city!"
11462476,72226814,2016-05-01,64700004,Sivanthan,"Chris is a great host. He responds quickly to questions. For example, the night that we arrived the Internet was down. He called the cable company and it was fixed in 30 minutes like he said it would be. Great location for walking everywhere (major tourist attractions/train). Parking is metered during the day only and wasn't an issue because it was Spring Break."

It was a nice small, cozy place and in a great neighborhood, for a reasonable price. Absolutely would stay again."
11462476,74312038,2016-05-14,2916115,Magnolia,"No charm or hospitality, but the location is good and the place is clean. It's clear from the house manual/rules that this place is not supposed to be rented out, and the owner's rules/instructions come off as inhospitable and a bit rude (be invisible to neighbors, how many towels you should use, how displeased they'll be if you cook with oil, guests' rather extensive cleaning obligations, etc.) given what I paid for the night there. Pay close attention to the nightly rate: it's per person, which is a bit unusual and caught me by surprise when I was charged double the expected rate to travel with my partner (extra charge beyond 2ppl is normal, but the same rate usually applies for 1-2ppl) - but that was my own mistake. It's clear that no one lives there and it's just for renting out, but it's clean and it's nice to have a kitchen if you're staying there for a longer time. The location is walking distance to Fenway, Boston College, the river. Not a charming neighborhood (just big chain restaurants and bars), but good location if you're there for those landmarks."

I can confirm that the location of his apartment is truly in the Heart of South End and close access to all the restaurants on Tremont and short walk into Back Bay.

1525494,15140292,2014-07-03,15520884,Mark,"I stayed at Ari's place for 15 nights. Ari is a wonderful host, very courteous, and always available if you need help. He's always trying to improve the experience and the comfort of his guests. The room itself was spacious, comfortable, and as described by Ari. It is one of 6 bedrooms in the house with 2 bathrooms. There is an additional common living room, kitchen, and porch. The neighborhood that Ari's house is located is great and safe. There are at least a dozen good restaurants and a few convenience and grocery stores within 10 minutes walking. Moreover, his place is conveniently located to bus stops, the metro line, and a Hubway location if you want to go somewhere else in Boston. I would recommend staying with Ari to anyone looking for a relatively inexpensive location to stay in the Boston area."
1525494,20407252,2014-09-29,3815642,Felix,"I've been at Ari's house for three months this summer and it's been great! Ari is a great host and very helpful. The room was very nice, exactly as it was in the photo. It had air conditioning what was great in the summer! In the other hand, the house itself and the facilities were great too: kitchen, toilet and of course, laundry! And it was always very clean. Great experience. Especially recommended for those or you going to BC (where I was). There are just 10 minutes in the B line!"
He estado en casa de Ari tres meses este verano y ha sido una gran experiencia. Ari es un gran anfitrión y está siempre dispuesto a ayudar. La habitación es exactamente igual a como está en la foto y tenía aire acondicionado,lo que para verano fue indispensable. Por otro lado,los recursos de la casa también estaban muy bien: cocina,baños y lavandería. Y la casa siempre estaba muy limpia. Una gran experiencia,"sobre todo para aquellos que vais a BC (donde he estado trabajando yo). Son sólo 10 minutos en la línea B!\"",
1525494,22527961,2014-11-09,9782365,Eleonore,"Overall, it was a very nice stay with Ari!"
I didn't expect that there were so many people living there,but that made it al even more comfy (always people around). The house is really close to everything,you can easily take the bus or even go walking (in the sun). There were nice restaurants across,i loved the one with the vegan ice creams (amazing)!,,
I have some few minor remarks:,,,,,
-Ari was not around when I arrived (but then again,you have the other people living in the house,and they were very pleased to welcome me),,,
-there is a lot of noise from the street (a fire department next to the house),,,,,
But overall,"I enjoyed the stay!\"",,,,
1525494,32174225,2015-05-15,4224077,Perihan,"The location of the house is nice. Only a 10 minute ride to the T, which gets you to the city. I had a long stay, so obviously a couple of issues arose, but Ari was quick to respond, and resolve them."
1525494,32551958,2015-05-19,31394301,Joshua,"During our trip, Ari was out of town; however, he managed to keep in contact and answer all of our questions in a prompt manner.  The neighborhood was conveniently located next to a T station, which brought us into the center of Boston within ten minutes."
Overall,the room presented as it was advertised.,,,,

1525494,32721652,2015-05-20,29589878,Zhili,Nice and clean room! Nice and quiet neighborhood! Didn't get a chance to see the host but I enjoyed my stay!
1525494,32858855,2015-05-22,33379866,Sachin,"Yes. The listing was absolutely correct and from the word go Ari was on top of everything like connecting every alternate day via email or providing detailed information on everything that I asked and I didn't ask for :-). Ari is very good host, I doubt he does all this for money. I think B&B services gives him some sense of satisfaction. My guess."
1525494,33107198,2015-05-25,30872251,Duy,Very Straight forward.  I had access to everything I needed. Ari was very helpful and accessible.
1525494,33409149,2015-05-27,15781289,Jahaida,My stay at Ari's place was amazing. I was in Boston for just 48hrs in and out with a budget.
Location was practical,the entire place was super clean. The house is huge,the kitchen,the bathrooms as well. The room very bright indeed.,,
I got there after a long and hot memorial weekend day,took a shower,turned my room's A/C on and in 30mins I was soundly asleep.,,,
"I recommend this place for short and long stays. You'll feel right at home. \"",,,,,
1525494,33550105,2015-05-29,34002822,Chris,"Ari was great. Lightning fast response times, answered all my questions and more."
"A good example of the \"\"and more\"\" ... I told Ari I was going to take Uber to his house. He responded with a recommendation to take Lyft because it's slightly more built out (and cheaper) in Boston. There was no need for him to take the time to say that",but he did,and it was much appreciated.,,,
The place is great,"exactly as advertised. Bathroom beyond the kitchen on the first floor is a hidden gem.\"",,,,
1525494,33636677,2015-05-30,23548817,Thy,The room was clean. But the bathroom was shared with many people. We managed to find a parking space thanks to Ari's directions.
1525494,33867090,2015-06-01,30203098,Anne,"Nous avons passes 3 jours super à Boston et Ari à pleinement contribué à la réussite de notre séjour. Il a été très disponible pour nous conseiller de bons endroits (déjeuner, visites)"
De plus la chambre que nous avons loué correspondait tout à fait à ce que nous recherchions :,,,,,
Très bon rapport qualité/prix,,,,,
Très propre,,,,,
Proche du centre ville de Boston,dans un beau quartier,,,,
Proche de toutes commodités,,,,,
Merci beaucoup,"un super endroit que je recommande chaleureusement et dans lequel je reviendrais avec plaisir \"",,,,
1525494,34092771,2015-06-04,34002305,Jessika,"Unfortunately we changed our travel plans and could not stay in Ari`s house. however, before our planed stay, he would always respond to our messages and help us to get the refund for the day we could not stay with him. I can totally recommend him."
1525494,34496108,2015-06-08,32774793,Dave,The host managed check-in seemlessly from abroad.  Interesting neighborhood for people-watching and casual dining - urban hip/ college.  Room was bright and comfortable.  House is older but VERY clean.
1525494,34992338,2015-06-14,14697449,Samuel,"This was a nice room with air conditioning and a fridge, very well-situated with shopping, restaurants, and proximity to a range of T lines.  It was easy to come and go as I needed, and even though I didn't meet Ari face to face, he always responded quickly to texts when I needed advice about the neighborhood.  I would stay here again, no question."
1525494,35412557,2015-06-18,8043355,Dagný,"The check-in went well even though Ari was abroad. We stayed for two nights. The room was nice and everything was clean. The bed was not quite long enough for my very tall boyfriend but we managed just fine :) . We couldn't find parking anywhere nearby but as soon as we asked Ari, he helped us out to find a good place to park. The location is nice. Overall this was a great stay."
1525494,48398748,2015-09-26,34262361,Casey,I stayed here for a week and everything went smoothly.  The room was very clean and quiet and the fridge in the room was very convenient.  I did not meet Ari but he was always available via message if I needed him.
1525494,48591741,2015-09-27,43768163,Cynthia,"The room was ok. Not a real airbnb more like an motel but with no tv in your room! If you want to live a real airbnb experience dont go there, cause we didnt saw Ari. Parking is a little bit hard to get cause its residential and you need a vignet. If you just want to sleep, i recommand you. Finaly, whats turn me off its when Ari send me a message to ask me to give him a 5 stars!!"
1525494,52488143,2015-10-30,26616937,Anne,"Dette stedet har en god beliggenhet, og det er kort vei til både buss og trikkeholdeplass. Jeg møtte aldri Ari i løpet av alle de ukene jeg bodde der, men han svarte greitt på henvendelser. Jeg hadde det bra da jeg bodde her. Det er 6 rom til utleie i huset ( dvs. alle soverommene), huset er gammelt og litt slitt, og siden det var noen problemer med varmeanlegget var det periodevis kaldt på kjøkkenet og fellesrom da jeg bodde her. Vi fikk varmeovner til rommene - veldig bra :-) det var mange saker i fellesrommene og det så ut som det fungerte som lager. Det er helt klart sammenheng mellom pris og standard, og man får det man betaler for."
1525494,60518100,2016-01-24,54542642,Bianca,Ari tried to make me feel welcome and comfortable. The neighborhood seemed nice with everything around the corner and a bus station not even one minute away and the green line 10 minutes away.
1525494,62115952,2016-02-11,52667131,Richard,Awesome host great friend thanks Ari
1525494,62200269,2016-02-12,52667131,Richard,I have stayed with Ari quite some time now and he is not only a great host but also a good friend thanks Ari
1525494,62295579,2016-02-13,52667131,Richard,Best host ever thanks for the great hospitality
1525494,62427652,2016-02-14,52667131,Richard,Every time I stay with Ari it's always a great experience.
1525494,62611983,2016-02-15,52667131,Richard,The experience exceeded my expectations Ari is the best host ever
1525494,62771350,2016-02-16,52667131,Richard,Great host makes the stay feel welcome and everything is great about the room
1525494,63104006,2016-02-20,55920110,Tae Woon,Everything was so neatly and perfectly prepared as it is described. It was my first Airbnb and it was definitely the right one that I would like to revisit.
The host,Ari,is a nice guy and professional at hosting and dealing with guests. Although I wouldn't able to talk to him face to face for his business trip,he was always considerable and accessible host that I would not feel any uncomfortableness during the staying.,,
Other than the great host,I would strongly recommend this place for several reasons. It is very close to Green line T-station about 5 to 7 minutes by walk. And,there are lot of restaurants and bars around this place where you can explore various cuisines.,,,
If you are looking for economical,yet cozy Airbnb around Boston Area,I would strongly recommend this place.,,,

1525494,63506573,2016-02-23,52304003,Jonas,"Es hat alles super geklappt, der CheckIn war sehr einfach und das Zimmer genau richtig für unseren Aufenthalt. Ari hat sich immer wieder nach unserem Befinden erkundigt und hat auch auf unsere Fragen treffend und zeitnah geantwortet."
"Alles in allem waren wir sehr zufrieden mit Aris Unterkunft. \"",,,,,
1525494,63921050,2016-02-28,56285031,希,"Great days in Ari's place!The room is quite warm and cozy,and it's also quite easy to get to the downtown area.  Reasonable price and warmhearted host,it's an ideal place for visitors to live in Boston."
1525494,64249883,2016-03-01,31761316,Rupika,Room was comfortable. I was on third floor and bathroom on second which wasn't ideal but overall decent stay for a night or 2. Ari was very helpful. Would recommend
1525494,64911471,2016-03-09,60002275,Ryutaro,"Was such a nice stay in Allston. The room was clean and comfortable with nothing exaggerating but everything needed. A supermarket, pharmacy, various restaurants and public transportation, all were pretty accessible from the place. And Ari was a helpful host. Unfortunately I couldn't meet him but he replied to every single question and message gently and quickly."
1525494,65087786,2016-03-10,439945,Nathaniel,Room was great -- location is very practice for getting to HBS (steps away from the 66 bus).
1525494,65208850,2016-03-11,61663856,Yechiel,This is my fourth time staying at Aris. His house is amazing comfortable and quiet exactly what i need. He has a bunch of listings and hosting is his full time job. Whenever i need anything he is there to help in lightning speed. Don't this twice about staying with ari.
1525494,65409029,2016-03-13,61310712,Colleen,"We stayed for 2 nights and Ari made us feel very welcome! The room was cozy & clean; there was even a portable heater which was perfect since those nights were cold. The location was great since it's so close to Boston and is near public transportation as well as bars and restaurants. Overall, we had a really great stay!"
1525494,65515317,2016-03-15,5161323,Dave,"\"It was nice enough given the cheap price. The house is a bit of a fixer-upper (loose door knobs, banged up dry-wall, etc), but the room was clean and that's what I was looking for. It seems like Ari does most of his hosting remotely, and although he was attentive (via messaging) it was a bit much. He was so eager to pester me for a 5 star review that at 5am the morning I was to check in he thanked me for coming, said I was a great guest, and asked when I was checking out. About a week after my stay he called at 6:30am to ask for a good review. Time zones are not his strong suit. He seems excited and genuinely trying to do a good job, I'd just recommend putting the energy into fixing up the place instead of worrying about being an officially badged airbnb \"\"superhost\"\".\""
1525494,65516090,2016-03-15,30824856,Esther,"This room has a very modern and calming vibe to it. I particularly enjoyed the christmas tree lights and scented candles! As mentioned in my previous reviews, I am a frequent guest of Ari's and he is a very professional host with excellent properties!"
1525494,65884156,2016-03-17,9618964,Gregory,"My second stay. Ari is kind, communication is excellent, arriving is easy. The room is clean and the bed is comfortable. Space heater with digital thermostat makes temperature control easy. A pleasant stay & I'd visit again."
1525494,65928711,2016-03-18,39441871,Doron,"Very good return for the money, and I've been in some airbnb places! Comfortable room, very clean, well maintained.  Scented by candles it's a nice surprise when one walks in!  Locsted close to a main street with shops etc."
1525494,66115718,2016-03-19,61436913,Sebastián,Ari was in constant communication with me before I checked in and gave good indications to find the place in Boston. He was fast to respond to me queries.
The place is similar to the pictures,in a house with other people that I did not have the chance to see. The place is good if your stay is to be outside most of time,which was in my case. If you're looking for a more guest-host experience,this is not the case.,,
Overall,"it is a good place to stay in. \"",,,,
1525494,66290407,2016-03-20,58256265,Ruiping,"I had a really good time in Ari's House. It's so nice, warm and neat. And it's definitely the most convenient location if you want to stay in Allston and get close to all the food chances. Ari is also very helpful and delightful, he will make you feel really welcomed and all of that making your trip even happier than you expected."
1525494,66803282,2016-03-24,60168222,Omi,It was a great experience living at Ari's house. I will definitely will be back again someday. Highly recommended. Ari is very kind and helpful
1525494,66803493,2016-03-24,39441871,Doron,I've been a regular 'sleeper' at ari's for a while now.  All is always on the highest standards.

1525494,74042693,2016-05-12,50671490,Vijay,Very proactive host. A faculty from overseas was in need of an accommodation near Boston University and this location  worked out nicely. I plan to use the private room once again in the near future. Across from two vegan restaurants.

La maison qui comprend plusieurs chambres louées n'est pas toute neuve mais elle est grande, bien équipée et situé à quelques stations de bus ou tram de Harvard  (10 mn) et du centre de boston (20 mn). c est un bon rapport qualité prix pour Boston."

Wasn't bothered by any other guests in the house. This was my first Airbnb room and I can only hope the rest are this comfortable, direct, and unobtrusive as this one was."
1525494,76593527,2016-05-28,31550146,Mimi,I had such a great experience!!! Ari was a wonderful hosted who responded to my needs so promptly. I remember that it was unseasonably warm at the time of my arrival and Ari installed an A/C as soon as I informed him that the room was warm. I couldn't have asked for a better host!!! The location was perfect. I felt safe and comfortable.
1525494,77339283,2016-05-31,62243547,Felix,Unser Aufenthalt bei Ari war vollkommen ok. Das Zimmer war sehr sauber und von den anderen Gästen hat man kaum etwas mitbekommen. Lediglich das Alter und die hier und da etwas abgenutzten Möbel fehlten zur perfekten Unterkunft. Die Parkplatzsuche gestaltet sich in Boston grundsätzlich immer etwas schwierig. Jedoch war Ari uns hier sehr hilfsbereit. Empfehlen kann ich die Restaurants in der Nähe des Apartments - egal ob vegetarisch im Grasshopper oder amerikanisch im Lulus. Hier gibt es für jeden Geschmack tolle Restaurants in 5 Minuten Umkreis.
1525494,77930145,2016-06-04,68641375,Brian,"The check in process was easy and accommodating to a late arrival (we quietly arrived at 1:00 in the morning).   The location in Allston was prime, really minutes away from great bars and restaurants.  I strongly recommend checking out Deep Ellum, and Grasshopper.  Both amazing places to go!"
The room was a bit different than the image shown,it's actually a whole house AIRBNB set up,with 6 different rooms.  There are 2 bathrooms,which on a few occasions required some waiting for people to clear out before the next person would make it in.,,
Our overall experience was good,the room had it's own air conditioner,plenty of towels and was clean when we got there.  I'd describe it as cozy :)  Also,as I said before,the location was primo,"10-15 minute walk to the green T line which means it's about 45-55 minutes to get to Park Station in Boston which puts you in the middle of the city.  \""
1525494,79674137,2016-06-13,47172180,Florence,"Quartier très sympa, à quelques minutes à pied des transports en commun donc très facile pour se rendre dans le centre de Boston. De bons restaurants et magasins à proximité. Le logement est propre et accueillant. Ari s'est montré très accessible pour répondre à nos questions. Merci pour ce séjour !"
1525494,80278831,2016-06-17,75422782,Katherine,"Ari was a great host! He is very responsive to questions and individual needs. There are 6 guest rooms in this house, so do plan on running into other guests in hallways and sharing restrooms. The house was very clean and the other guests were nice. If you are hoping to be in walking distance from places like the Boston Commons, this is rather far away, but if you are looking to stay in Allston, it would be great!"
1525494,81484708,2016-06-23,72719812,Glyn,Room was as described. Basic but clean and comfortable. Towels provided. 2 bathrooms in property. Access to kitchen/fridge. Area felt safe and not too noisy. 24hr mini supermarket 2 minutes walk was really useful. 57 bus stopped right outside and had me at Kenmore station for the T within 20 minutes. Uber from North End was around $15. Didn't meet host but had some useful and friendly communication.
"For my purpose as somewhere to sleep and shower was perfect. I would stay there again the next time I'm in Boston. \"",,,,,

The place was cozy, tidy, and I got to spend a decent amount of time speaking with Sergio. If you stay here, you will have some amazingly friendly hosts who are so helpful. Ashley was so great about being in contact with me ahead of time and throughout the course of my stay. She and Sergio were responsive and incredibly accommodating. They let me drop my bag off well before the check in time when I arrived at 7am. Furthermore, they let me actually begin my stay early by offerring use of the bathroom and sofa to sleep on before the previous night's guests had checked out. I really enjoyed my stay here and I think Ashley and Sergio make amazing hosts. You cannot beat the value of this place."
1868124,14993470,2014-06-30,5389632,Stephen,Great location and great unit. The check-in process was smooth. Everything was provided for -- even toothpaste! I would not hesitate to stay here again.
1868124,16032316,2014-07-20,17561906,Lynne,"We really enjoyed our week in Boston. The apartment was appropriately located in walking distance to every area we wanted to see. If you don't like to walk, the orange line is really close by. The only thing I would suggest is to bring earplugs, because the noise from the street level can be quite much - lots if emergency vehicles and screaming party animals. It was unfortunate that the pool was shut down the entire stay as we had looked forward to taking a dip after seven hours of walking. The main bed was very comfortable although the sofa bed would not be for any adult. Our child did not complain about it as she only weighs 40lbs. Overall would recommend this place to stay. The staff we friendly and helpful. They greeted us each day and welcomed us back each evening."

Apartment very neat, wifi and tv all working well. The view from the apartment at night was great. Washington street is an easy place to get to practically everywhere and it was only six stops to my son's college. I will definitely stay again when next I'm in Boston. Thanks for making my stay awesome."

Upon arrival all amenities were there, gift bag with household supplies. Building had a good gym and pool! Location is in china town/theater district, but its a great location - walking distance to everyone and surrounded by great bars, restaurants and all the theaters! I would highly recommend this place - check in is super easy as well!"
1868124,21015150,2014-10-09,21945248,Yucheng,"The apartment is excellent. It has a comfortable room and kind concierge. Of course, the convenient location and value-for-money are also the facts that the apartment is one of the best choice to live around Chinatown in Boston."

1868124,91470274,2016-08-05,41580982,Aris,This is a great location . Right in theater district and at edge of chinatown as well as  a block from Boston Commons.  Good dining is all around. Also very close to good shopping on Washington street .  Quincy market is less than a mile walking and the walk is very enjoyable. Boston is not a big town and you can walk to the Waterfront or North Station from this location. There is a market right down street with fresh produce  and a CVS and Walgreens are at the corners of the intersection.
If you do not feel like walking the orange subway line is about 1/2 a block away and the green line is a block away.,,,,,
The condo is on the 20th floor. Great views. It has a gym and pool that are very well kept. There is a concierge and a doorman as well.,,,,,
The place is run by a professional management company and they were very responsive to all my inquiries and very prompt.,,,,,
They supply towels and toiletries and adequate tissue and paper towels. There were 2 bottles of water in the fridge welcoming us. The only minor complaint is that a couple of the dishes did not appear to be clean. The welcome packet includes one dose of dishwashing soap and the instructions for checking out mention that the dishwasher needs to be emptied . I had used the dishwashing tablet already,so we washed everything else by hand. Not sure if the expectation is for the guests to leave the dishes clean for the next client as we put the dishes back in the cupboard as instructed. On the other hand,the place looked like it was very well maintained and very clean.,,,
Would not hesitate to stay there again. Highly recommended.,,,,,

There is one big master bedroom with a king bed and another bedroom with a queen bed (and a folding cot). She left us plenty of towels, blankets and pillows. We didn't cook much but the kitchen is fully stocked. Francine was reachable for any questions we had and left us detailed instructions when we arrived. Her two cats are also very friendly and fun!"

We stayed in Jamaica Plain for 3 weeks for the birth of our daughter's first baby, and needed a place close to where she lives.  Not only is the Suite close to her, but it's a great location in general, in walking distance to the shops and restaurants in J.P. Center and to the pond.  It's nice that the house is set back from the road so you don't get the noise from cars on Centre St.  The room itself is spacious and it was so helpful to have 2 sinks in the bathroom.  The kitchen is beautiful and also spacious.  Robin is a gracious hostess, helpful and accommodating, and we have truly become friends.  We highly recommend staying at the Roost-Master Suite!"

Large bedrooms, a modern kitchen at our disposal, interesting furnishings - we could ask for nothing more.  For sure, Robin's would be our first choice if life finds us once again in Jamaica Plain."
1167221,13826789,2014-06-05,13857007,Peter,We had a very pleasant stay at the Roost Master Suite. Robin and Dennis have been very helpful and great hosts. Great neighborhood with nice restaurants around and a short walk to the next T-station. Parking is also no problem. We really liked the room as well as the rest of the house. Robin arranged everything for breakfast which we could prepare on our own in the fully equipped kitchen whenever we liked. We would definitely come again!
1167221,13938854,2014-06-08,16260981,Joost,"Robin was a wonderful and busy host. Next to her real-estate activities she manages this home like a pro. The house itself is cosy and huge at the same time. All the art works of her daughter make it a very personal home. Going to downtown Boston is not hard, but whether you go by car or train, it will take you at least 45 minutes."
1167221,14380745,2014-06-17,1283800,Lukas,"Lovely place: classic Boston home meets modern Ikea. We really enjoyed our bedroom, with a separate room for our toddler. Access to the full featured kitchen was also a blessing. Would definitely come again."

The Master Suite is nicely furnished, roomy, very comfortable bed & easy chairs w/ flat screen TV, chest & closet space. Very nice private bath & stall shower. Kitchen is modern, well-equipped. This is a lovely, clean, well-cared-for place! Only problem is that I didn't get to meet Robin to tell her in person!"
1167221,14869525,2014-06-28,2819029,Pamela,"Staying in Robin's home in the master suite was a great value. The breakfast provided was make your own, there was plenty of coffee,  tea, fresh fruit,  oatmeal and Robin's daughter's delicious desserts. Her home was a 10 min walk to the T (subway) and 2 min walk to Jamaica Plain shops, delicious restaurants, cvs, grocery store and more. We felt very comfortable and welcome in Robin's home."
1167221,15770363,2014-07-15,4387600,Sarah,"Robin was a fantastic host! She was flexible about check in as my girlfriends and I all arrived at different times. She provided tips on places to check out and snacks, quick breakfast options, coffee and tea. The rooms (The Lion) were adorable and the bathroom was clean and spacious for multiple ladies getting ready at once. The area is very walkable with shops, bars and restaurants close by. Be sure to check out Salmagundi, a great hat shop and City Feed, a local market with excellent sandwiches. We took the T (about a 10-15 minute walk) to downtown, the airport, ferry and bus station. Wonderful experience, I would definitely stay here again!"
1167221,15934198,2014-07-18,11245271,Brooke,"What a lovely, funky place!  We had a car and parking here/driving downtown was no problem. I wish there had been time to use the jacuzzi tub because it looked awesome.  We also lucked out that the other folks renting were cool and ended up spending a fair amount of time in the common areas with them as a result.  If I find myself in Boston again I wouldn't hesitate to come back here!"

The place is stunning. It was like staying in a boutique hotel. Our room was humongous. There were two lovely armchairs in front of a large flatscreen TV and the bed was spacious and comfortable.,,,,,
The bathroom was superb. There was a walk-in shower and much to the delight of my 12-year-old daughter,a fully functioning Jacuzzi bath. There were two sinks,avoiding many arguments.,,,
The house is easy to reach,using local transport being located in in Jamaica Plain,and we fell in love with the neighborhood and spent 3 nights in the neighborhood hanging out in its' interesting bars,restaurants and ice cream parlors!!,,
Victoria and Robin are delightful and kind and generous host. They lay on breakfast facilities and we were lucky enough to have a lavish breakfast laid on by Robin as a special treat as her sister was visiting!!,,,,,

In spite of other guests in the house it was quiet and provided a great place to relax at the end of highly-traveled days.  It was our first time in Boston and we found the public transportation system very accessible from Jamaica Plain and a great deal.  The room was spacious and the private bathroom with whirlpool was just great.  There are a lot of shops and restaurants within walking distance and the bus route was within a two-minute walk.

1167221,35573690,2015-06-20,15423040,Michael,"Check in was relatively smooth.  The house is easy to find and the room appeared as advertised.  We could have used a little more assistance on travel plans in Boston that we inquired about... but instead we got a little lost.  The house itself is charming.  The room was comfortable, however it was not cleaned very well.  There were crumbs on the night stand (big ones!), generally dusty and the bathroom was definitely not cleaned thoroughly with dust and hair on the floor.  There were previous guests soap and bottles lying around which should have been stacked nicely or some thrown away.  The neighborhood is great to walk around in.  If you want to avoid downtown this is the 'trendy' place.  However, if you are heading downtown for the sites and Fenway you may want to stay closer to downtown."

We enjoyed especially the great kitchen with its offerings - it is a great place for communication with hosts and guests where we could feel the spirit of airbnb."

It's an easy walk to the Orange Line, which can take you wherever you want to go.  I was able to leave my car parked in the recessed spot during the entire visit.  Everything was clean and comfortable in the suite.  The Billie Holiday playing on a pleasant morning, with a summer breeze blowing through the kitchen, seemed to complement the house perfectly.  We spoke with Victoria briefly and she was very accommodating and friendly."
1167221,42663779,2015-08-15,8939691,Myranda,"such a lovely house. Spacious, tasteful, cozy, beautiful art. And a perfect host; so warm and intelligent. We had three wonderfull days. Though you're in a private house, and feel the lovely personal atmosphere there is a lot of privacy because the house is so big. Enormous kitchen with coffee and tea of good quality. Even breakfast is supported. Communication spotless, room clean, great bed, big bathroom ensuite is top. And the neighborhood is perfect too. 10 minutes walk to subway. After a day in busy centre of Boston this is a quiet paradise and we fully understand why so many guests found their way to the Rooster."
1167221,43971551,2015-08-23,6066548,Victoria,"Victoria was there to welcome us when we arrived, which we really appreciated, and also to answer any questions we had but otherwise gave us space to enjoy the neighbourhood. We loved Jamaica Plain and the Roost-Master suite was great - such a big room and beautiful furnishings. The local cafes and shops are good quality and everyone was super friendly. The pond nearby is fantastic to go for a walk or run. We would love to stay here again if visiting Boston."

JP as the locals call Jamaica Plains has a sense of local community  and less than 20 minutes to central Boston on the Orange Line T.

The space is furnished cleanly and has wonderful feelings with nice artworks. One of the best places I stayed in the area.  When you enter the house through the front door, the stair in the foyer leading to the second floor suite is in front of you. No need to go through the owners living spaces is a plus for a traveler. Victoria answered my text messages right away always and our communication was good all the time.  The house is located in a short walking distance from cafes and restaurants of Jamaica Plain."
1167221,56317498,2015-12-12,49098013,Taylor,Nice & easy stay. Good system for getting into apartment. Very comfortable beds. Nice jacuzzi tub in the master suite. About 1/2 mile walk to the T subway where you can catch a ride all over the city.

The master bath was also very nice and all item we needed were available.   We also appreciated the light breakfast that was part of this package. The kitchen was clean and modern.  Even though the home included several visitors, it was quiet and we had a very relaxing time. Victoria was very welcoming. We enjoyed visiting with her.We will stay here again!"

The bath had everthing we needed and 2 sinks!   Easy for a couple. I am an artist and I enjoyed the exceptional art work on the walls. The room was decorated obviously with a good eye for color,  pattern and comfort.  We hope to return many times."
1167221,65723692,2016-03-16,26489170,Julie,"Die Suite war wirklich sehr sehr schön und geschmackvoll eingerichtet. Dank der shoe-off policy ist es schön sauber. Am besten war das geräumige Bad, das zwei Waschbecken, eine große Dusche und einen Whirlpool zu bieten hat. Die Nachbarschaft ist idyllisch und ruhig, das Haus auch sehr schön. Es gibt noch zwei andere Suiten aber das bekommt man fast nicht mit. Der einzige Minuspunkt war, dass es verboten ist in der großen, toll ausgestatteten Küche zu kochen. Aber nichtsdestotrotz genossen wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr."

The property itself was well kept up and in a nice neighborhood within walking distance to the local restaurants and shops. The off-street parking was a nice convenience as well. The suite was clean, well-appointed and very comfortable and quiet. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb to others."
1167221,67632475,2016-03-30,61981504,David,"This is the first time my partner and I used Airbnb: what a wonderful surprise! Victoria greeted us when we arrived at the house and showed us around. It is absolutely beautiful, and filled with Victoria's artwork. We stayed in the master suite which was spacious, beautifully lit by natural light, and very homey, The suite had Wi-Fi and television, which was great, and a beautiful bathroom with a nice Jacuzzi tub for two!"
As if this weren't enough,The Roost could not be in a better location: it's in the heart of Jamaica Plain--one block from a beautiful walk around Jamaica Pond,one block from the Arnold Arboretum,and one block from your choice of terrific shops and restaurants.,,
We were absolutely blown away at the quality of our experience: a $250 room for a fraction of the price. We will return!,,,,,

When I reserved my flight, I discovered I was not able to actually take a 'red eye' so instead of arriving Fri morning, we arrived Thurs at 1 AM. Not only did they get my room ready early, they added an additional night with no additional cost, I actually received a refund."
We used uber to get there from the airport and the neighborhood was super cute. Room was beautiful and comfortable and the perfect sanctuary to come back to after expo and race craziness.,,,,,
Both ladies were very prompt with any email responses even though I never got a chance to meet them in person. I left quite early in the morning for race related things and got home pretty late at night every day.,,,,,

The house itself is beautifully furnished, very whimsical pieces all around and you really feel right at home. Victoria was there to receive us eventhough it was late till we got in and we met Robin on our last day. Both were really friendly and gave us great information and were great with communication from before we even booked until our last day. It's a nice neighbourhood which is close to Boston Central. Green St on the Orange line is about a good 20 minute walk but very pleasent and easy. On the way you can grab some great ice cream or coffee from the many cafes and restaurants. There's also a CVS in case you want to stock up on food,drink and toiletries. We stayed with our toddler and he loved the extra single room within the Suite, bath time in the Jacuzzi tub plus running around the big beautiful shared kitchen downstairs. The bed was super comfortable and central air-conditioning was not too cold or hot - just perfect. The kitchen was well-stocked and a lovely continental breakfast provided each morning. We would definitely stay again and next time, we'll make sure to check out Brookline neighbourhood and the Arbotorium as this time, we didn't have enough time! Thank you Robin and Victoria."

11687122,76656648,2016-05-28,55003196,Tanya,"I cannot say enough good things about the response time, helpfulness, and overall communication from my hosts.  Super easy in and out without bothering with mailing or exchanging keys.  Every question I had was answered immediately."
11687122,78743292,2016-06-08,8108142,Sean,Very nice unit and it was in brand new condition when we arrived.  Unfortunately the unit can be very noisy with a highway outside the window and construction across the street.
11687122,79455518,2016-06-12,55003196,Tanya,"The team at Flatbook is absolutely amazing, responsive, and accommodating in EVERY WAY.  I have never had a better experience and I have been travelling in apartments for multiple years."
11687122,80917380,2016-06-20,55293327,Marcelo,"Although we never met the host, check in couldn't be easier. Instructions for it were given prior to arrival and everything went smoothly."
The building and apartment are brand new and could not be in a better location. Within walking distance to all that Boston has to offer,"plus the convenience of a whole foods  around the corner. Great experience and highly recommended !\"",,,,
11687122,87907225,2016-07-22,80890115,Gemma,"Great host before arrival however upon arrival a few things cropped up that let them down. Missing items in the apartment which did not get sorted until over half way through our stay, including a second key which was absolutely required for two of us staying on business. Their communication was fine however they did not keep me informed about the missing items unless i chased them."
The apartment was clean though,as photographed,except for 2 missing items and not actually as noisy as others had described - i imagined worse inside the apartment - it's noisy outside though.,,,
"Nice communal pool and gym. Location is fine but you need a taxi to most places you'd want to go. \"",,,,,
11687122,98159064,2016-08-29,18070683,Lori,"I loved everything about staying in this place. All of the instructions were wonderful. The apartment was great! It allowed me the ability to explore a new neighborhood in Boston that I hadn't been to. I also loved being right next to a Whole Foods. A great, great experience overall. Thank you!"
12386020,70734672,2016-04-20,51269796,Anubha,"We had an amazing stay at Deb's place. She has done such a nice interior that your inner creative mind will ponder, what similar things can I do at my own place. She is very friendly and caring person. She provided us with muffins, milk and coffee for breakfast. The bed was very comfortable and we had a good sleep. She also cooperated with our late check in time. This place is not well connected by public transport but uber was always available."
12386020,74916757,2016-05-17,66876694,Marie,"Deborah was a great host! She was very friendly, welcoming and generous! In the morning there were muffins and a big cup of coffee waiting for us :) Deb was always making sure that we had everything we needed, for example extra blankets when it was colder than expected. You can have nice chats with her, but she respects your privacy as well :)"
12386020,75783304,2016-05-23,2078831,Emily,"My husband and I had a fabulous stay here. Deborah was not only very responsive, she was very accommodating to our travel schedule. This place is the cutest, and the bedroom and bathroom we used were clean and bright. My husband could not stop talking about how comfortable the bed was. She even made us coffee and muffins for us in the morning, but unfortunately, we already had breakfast plans- next time, though! Very nice and quiet neighborhood with easy parking. We definitely recommend staying here!"
12386020,76174564,2016-05-25,44385063,Bill,"Deborah provided a warm welcome and terrific stay.  Her bright, open living room was an inviting spot to read and relax.  She offered several helpful recommendations for dinner in downtown Roslindale (Birch Street Bistro was outstanding).  Bedroom was quiet and very comfortable.  And coffee, muffins and conversation in the sun-room overlooking the rear woods was a nice way to start the morning!  Hope to be back on my next stay in Boston."
12386020,90490966,2016-08-01,79673145,Gene,"Had a great stay.  Deb (and her daughter) was helpful, accommodating and extremely cordial.   She went out of her to make sure we were comfortable during a summer heat wave.   Location is a little out of the way but perfect for our needs.   Would strongly recommend Deb!"
12386020,92683541,2016-08-09,67229762,Mathilde,"Super séjour chez Deborah ! Notre hôte a ete presente et d'une grande amabilite. Pour notre premier passage aux États-Unis, ce fût très appréciable d'être accueilli de la sorte ! Deborah est une personne intéressante et qui a su nous guider durant notre séjour. Nous nous sommes senti en confiance !"
De plus,son petit chat est très affectueux,"ce qui donne d'autant  plus le sentiment d'être \"\"chez soi\"\"",,,
Encore un grand merci pour cette accueil et peut-être à une prochaine fois,"aux États-Unis ou en France maybe !\"",,,,
12386020,97440293,2016-08-27,52145422,Bénédicte,"Très beau séjour chez Deborah à Roslindale. Nous avons été très bien accueillies, et notre hôte a été très attentive à nous, toujours prête à nous conseiller, à nous aider si besoin dans notre galère d'étudiantes en recherche de logement... et le café, comme indiqué sur la description, est fantastique ! Je recommande vivement."
12386020,97819792,2016-08-28,37654025,Yang,"We loved our stay in Deborah's place! The place is located in a very nice and quite area. The air is fresh and close to the nature. The room is very cozy, clean and beautifully furnished. The bed is super comfy and we had very good sleep during our stay."
Deborah was a great host. She's welcoming and thoughtful. We felt comfortable and cared for. She picked us after our arriving and gave us a ride when we leaving. She also made amazing coffee for us in the morning. And I have to say the cat Gus is an angel! He is cuddly and super sweet. He would softly greeting you in the morning and give you  love. We really enjoyed our time staying here.,,,,,
"Definitely will be back on my next stay in Boston. Thanks again for everything. :)\"",,,,,
2916208,12708049,2014-05-08,3000537,Sah Fee Yuh,"The perfect stay. Astoundingly clean and tidy room and apartment. FYI: the room has folding doors (the slotted blinds type that lets a but of light/sound through) that open up to the living room, so the room is not quite private enough for a couple in my opinion, but as I wasn't there with my boyfriend, this didn't concern me. An excellent and caring host, who was quick to answer any questions I had or to make recommendations. I would stay here again."
2916208,12806573,2014-05-11,691291,Daniel,Yucel was very helpful and attentive to all my needs. An amazing host that I would love to stay with again when I'm in Boston.
If you're a student,tourist or here for business,The area was pretty close to everything,either by walking or Subway,it was very quick to reach Harvard / MIT,Downtown

2916208,13191442,2014-05-21,1255824,Germain,Nice quiet building in South End with plenty of nice cafes around and easy transportation to the other parts of the city. Small room in a super clean apartment on the 1st floor. It was very easy to coordinate with Yucel by text (we were pretty busy and saw in only once).
2916208,13291654,2014-05-24,15201194,Marco,"The apartment is great as well as Yucel as a hoster. The place is indeed well located, from a walkable distance to the city best atractions. I recomend without restrictions Yucel's place to anyone who wants to visit the beaultful Boston."

The home is in a good location - easy to walk to Boston Public Library and the shops.,,,,,
There are some small boutiques,restaurants,and a grocery store very close for whatever you need.,,,
Public transport is very accessible,making it easy to go wherever you want in Boston.,,,,

2916208,18100857,2014-08-21,4125359,Kevin,Yucel was a great host. Flexible with check-in and check-out times and was able to give me the keys during his lunch break. Apartment is clean and in a great area of Boston. Definitely recommended!
2916208,19542384,2014-09-14,19961912,Matthew,Yucel was more than accommodating and his place was clean and conveniently located. The neighborhood was easy to get around in and Yucel recommended a great coffee shop within walking distance.
"Would absolutely recommend Yucel to others visiting Boston.  \"",,,,,
2916208,19939477,2014-09-21,19473431,Gary,Very clean and comfortable. Big closet. Safe location. $25 cab to airport. Clean bathroom with a good shower. Yucel was very nice and worked with me to arrange arrival time. He also had a iron and ironing board for me which I really needed. Felt very private. Hardly saw him while I was in town. Would recommend for affordable and convenient place to stay.
2916208,20125939,2014-09-23,809083,Michael,"Yucel was a great and easygoing host. His communication prior to my stay was lightning fast and clear. The room was cozy with a comfortable bed, and the apartment very clean. The apartment is on a quiet street but within a two-block walk of South End restaurants, bars, and shops. Yucel gave me a great recommendation for dinner (Stella), where I had a delicious nouveau Italian meal served by a friendly staff. I look forward to visiting again when I can spend a little more time in this charming neighborhood. Thanks, Yucel!"
2916208,20172504,2014-09-24,20448831,AbdulRahman,Yucel Yigit was a very nice man .. everything was clean and organised .. He was very flexible with me regarding the check out I really appreciate this point ..
2916208,20211815,2014-09-25,18915651,Matt,Yucel was a very good host. I was only staying overnight but he was very accommodating with arranging my late afternoon check-in. The apartment was very clean and the room was comfortable. The apartment is in a good location - a short walk to the bus and about 20mins walk to downtown.
2916208,20282630,2014-09-27,6373100,Pierre,Nice and clean  apartment in a lovely area of Boston. Yucel is a nice guy. You should go there...
2916208,20458211,2014-09-29,21378227,Benjamin,"Staying with Yucel was very easy and plesant.  I stayed the weekend and our paths hardly crossed, but always felt he was available if I needed something. The apartment is niceley furnished and tidy. The kitchen was made available and I could see using it if I had stayed longer. Neighborhood has great access to South End restaurants as well as Freeway access for longer trips.  Parking can be a bit tricky in that neighborhood (all of Boston really), but I was able to make it work (probably because it was the weekend).  Thanks a lot Yucel and I'll certainly arrange a stay with you next time I'm in the area!"
2916208,20659207,2014-10-03,21123256,Pauline,"expérience décevante, peut-être que mes attentes étaient trop grandes"
2916208,23074793,2014-11-22,21876207,Huma,Yucel was extremely accommodating with my hectic travel plans. The apartment was clean and conveniently located. I would recommend to stay with Yucel again.
2916208,23563226,2014-12-04,1528103,Stacy,Yucel was able to accommodate my late arrival and provided great recommendations on restaurants in the neighborhood.

2916208,25998957,2015-02-01,10967086,Anthony,"I stayed with Yucel for a month while working in Boston. The location is great, I walked to work every day. You have easy access to all the restaurants and bars in the south end, as well as chinatown and the north end. The silver line bus is 1 block away if you need to link up with the subway. Another great part is being so close to the airport; it only takes 10 minutes and $10 on uber or lyft. The new Whole Foods just opened down the street as well. The bedroom is small but you have access to the full apartment and everything is very clean. This place is a steal at 1/2 or 1/3 of the price hotels in this area."
2916208,30179596,2015-04-18,24618334,Christie,"Fabulous experience! While I was only in Boston for one night and mostly occupied with work, Yucel was extremely accommodating. He was flexible to my check-in time and was waiting to give me a tour and my set of keys upon my arrival with a glass of water on the kitchen table and a fresh towel on the bed. The apartment was trendy and clean, the bed was comfy, and the location, although quiet, was ideally situated near the South Station Amtrak. I would certainly stay here again!"
2916208,30318431,2015-04-20,3515990,Jeffrey,"We very much enjoyed our stay. Yucel was quite accommodating, esp for our check in/out. In that respect, he was a lifesaver, actually. Overall, we were very comfortable during our stay and can recommend his apartment to others."
2916208,37534123,2015-07-07,37316719,Sean,"We enjoyed our first experience, Yucel was great. Even though we didn't get in till late he was very accommodating, and knows some good restaurants in the area. Would recommend him to others."

3616081,18038252,2014-08-20,11800573,Michaela,It was such a delightful place to stay. So many nice amenities and easy walking distance to wonderful food. The antique tub with soft robes made me never want to leave. To the assortment of teas and treats.   The bed had down pillows and comforter i even think the mattress was.  Deff a two thumbs up. For soft sleepers there is a bit of fan noise and you can sometimes here the train. But i did not bother or effect my experience.
3616081,18215619,2014-08-23,20182044,Adam,"Andrea was a great host.  She was super welcoming, well prepared, and had everything we could have needed in the house.  The place was cozy, and perfect for our needs.  She was very accommodating and flexible on our arrival and departure timing.  Home is in a fantastic location, walking distance to everything, especially the Orange line.  Also has a parking space which was super helpful in an area with limited parking.  Would definitely stay here again.  Thank you Andrea!"
3616081,18383062,2014-08-25,15964388,Lee,"A perfect airbnb experience! My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend in Boston and everything was exactly as described. Andrea was very welcoming and easy to reach, while we still had our own very private space, with its own entrance and garden. Literally a 3min walk to the subway, and very convenient parking! Jamaica Plain is a beautiful area of Boston and I definitely recommend this Urban Oasis to anyone looking to for hotel style accommodations at a great price!"
3616081,18506753,2014-08-27,20293697,Nick,"First off, Andrea was awesome and very welcoming. When we arrived she gave us a tour of the apartment. It's a cute, fun sized place. It had everything from bathrobes to Apple TV to delicious coffee. The bed was extremely comfortable with a lot of pillows! I really can't complain and if I'm ever in the area again, I know where I'll be staying. Also we ended up going to Bella Luna(Andrea recommended) for dinner - really good food! Thanks Andrea!"
3616081,18608069,2014-08-28,17877401,Ryan,"Staying at the Urban Oasis with Andrea as my host was a wonderful experience. The place is quant and makes you feel as if you are in a little beach bungalow without the water and sand :). I stayed for just one night but found a lovely place for dinner not far from where I stayed (Jamaica Plain is full of nice restaurants and cafes). The neighborhood was lively and had a park path that was perfect for my morning run. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in the Boston area. Andrea and her daughter Shayna were both wonderful hosts as well as very communicative and accommodating. If you decide on staying at the Urban Oasis, enjoy your stay :)"
3616081,18840512,2014-09-01,20282691,Charles,"Andrea made us feel so welcomed long before we arrived, that meeting her was one of the best parts of our stay. Right away, Andrea made herself available to us for anything we might need, but we could tell she put a great deal of thought into considering us as her guests that there was nothing we could ask for that she had not already provided. And the creativity put into designing this cozy space makes Urban Oasis a true ‘oasis within an oasis.’"
Embedded in Jamaica Plain (Boston),this quaint neighborhood is a gem and Urban Oasis is minutes from its markets,restaurants,bookshops,art galleries,and the Arnold Arboretum
3616081,19052135,2014-09-05,20538427,Roberto,My wife and I stayed in Andrea's Oasis recently while visiting Boston. We enjoyed our time very much! Andrea was very meticulous and thoughtful in preparing the cottage for us - we had everything we needed and more! We appreciated how close the apartment is from the subway. The neighborhood is quaint and has cafes and restaurants a few blocks away. Would recommend very much!
3616081,19526390,2014-09-14,2644617,Amy,"\"I booked the \"\"Urban Oasis\"\" for my in-laws from India who were visiting Boston for 9 days"
3616081,19785677,2014-09-18,11148621,Morgan,"Our stay at Andrea's Urban Oasis was everything we expected and more! We were looking for a comfortable, private place to stay in a great neighborhood just for a quick trip to Boston. From the point of booking, to the time we checked out, Andrea's communication made us feel super welcome and very informed!"
The information she sent prior to our arrival made finding her place incredibly easy. She greeted us when we parked and gave us a little tour of the place. She is so nice and welcoming and you can really tell that she takes pride in the wonderful little oasis she has created for AirBnb guests.,,,,,
Everything was spotless,well organized,and smelled like a spa! She has taken steps to provide just about anything you could possibly need during your stay,and I have no doubt if we were somehow in need of anything else,she'd help us make it happen!,
There is ample space to store your belongings,lots of hooks to hang things that may need to be hung. There is a lovely kitchen area with basic cooking supplies,a small fridge,sink area,toaster oven,microwave
From a practical standpoint,Andrea's Urban Oasis is a very short walk to the T. And she has put together a wonderful bulletin board with maps and recommendations for local eateries and activities. We took her suggestion to try the nearby City Feed and Supply on our way out in the morning and were quite pleased. :),,,,
If you drive,follow her directions to get to her place. It's very easy to find! But it is tucked back off the street,and there is a parking space just for you! Everything combined make this a true Oasis in an Urban setting. Quiet and peaceful,but close to all the fun! Thanks for the great stay Andrea,"and hope to book again on our next trip.\"",
3616081,19840044,2014-09-19,19001978,Austen,"My partner and I got away for the weekend and stayed here. It was our first time experience with AirBNB and we are pretty sure we are spoiled for life. Andrea's place is an absolute gem and if we can book it again, we will."
Our flight got in late but Andrea was very accommodating,making sure we got in to the cottage alright. When we got in,we were immediately smiling at how cute and cozy the place was. It is clear a tremendous amount of thought and skill went into this place. Everything we needed was exactly where it logically should have been. The place was adorable. (She denies experience as a floor designer for Anthropologie,but I don't believe her.) Everything we needed was there,including little touches like Andes candies and a corkboard with local cafes and things to do cut out and posted. The bed was super comfy and the coffee was easy to find and make. There were even turbie twists in the bathroom. Love it.,
Andrea is a great host. Someone else described her as available but non invasive,which is exactly our experience. We spoke with her more extensively the morning after arriving and she is wonderful. I feel like we just stayed at my cool aunt's house or something.,,,,
"Definitely will be returning.\"",,,,,
3616081,19899586,2014-09-20,20981836,Kristin,"Andrea has a really great place and was an exceptional host! The room was very clean and beautifully decorated. She put a great amount of effort into the details, fitting so much in the space. Perfect location for us and Andrea 's advice to use the app Uber saved time and money and we used it all night! Wish we could have stayed longer and will be back again to explore the area further!"
3616081,21034237,2014-10-10,6391049,Emily,"What a gracious hostess! The Urban Oasis more than exceeded my expectations. Andrea thought of everything from fine soaps to fresh coffee to chocolates before bed. The bed and linens were nothing short of luxurious, a wonderful treat since I stayed at the Urban Oasis for just about three weeks. During my stay, Andrea was attentive to my every need. I came and went with ease and the fact that The Urban Oasis offered free, off-street parking was fantastic. I fell in love with Jamaica Plain during my stay, and I always felt safe walking around, even at night.  The icing on the cake? My morning strolls around the historic Jamaica Pond, only a 10-minute walk from Andrea's place.  I can't recommend The Urban Oasis and its gracious owner more highly for a Boston getaway."
3616081,21133504,2014-10-12,11708539,Kyle,"Our Boston weekend was made absolutely delightful by our stay at Urban Oasis.  The neighborhood was interesting & comfortable to walk around, a great location close to parks, public transport, cafes.  Our hostess was very responsive to our emails, and has a most charming little spot with thoughtful attention to detail.  Loved, loved it here, and hope to be regulars on return visits!"
3616081,21232921,2014-10-13,9196449,Jenny,"My boyfriend and I felt right at home in Andrea's cozy Oasis. It had a beautiful beachy feel and was right by the train, restaurants, and a nice park! I would definitely stay there again!"
3616081,21341987,2014-10-15,15101572,Mark,"Andrea was a gracious hostess and provided us with a beautiful living space for a night. We enjoyed our stay very much. Andrea was easy to get a hold of and more than helpful in providing us with information about the house and neighborhood. Thanks for everything, Andrea."
3616081,21428136,2014-10-17,17162442,Henk,"Andrea's Urban Oasis is a small but very clean and tastefully decorated apartment. She is very helpful and has organized everything extreme good. Despite that the apartment is small, there is everything that you could need. She communicates very good and correct, but never is intrusive. If you need here, she's there to help you."
Two minor points: the hot water supply is near the bedroom behind a curtain and makes a lot of noise when someone turns the hot water tap on. Sleeping at that time is not possible.,,,,,
The apartment is in the 'basement' and Andrea and her family lives above the apartment. Unfortunately you can hear them talk and walk.,,,,,
Finally,the metrostation is at walking distance,so you can easily reach Boston Downtown in just 20 minutes.,,,
Summarized,a good place to stay in Boston.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3616081,21464276,2014-10-18,12829537,Emily,Andrea was very welcoming and friendly! The space is small but cozy and perfect for a few nights. Location is awesome- right off the orange line making it very easy to get to and from downtown Boston. Really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely recommend it!
3616081,21541863,2014-10-19,20656032,Christopher,"Andrea's place was great.  From the off street parking to the personal touches and little extras she provides.  Andrea's Urban Oasis was more like spending the night at a friends house, we will definitely stay with her again."
3616081,21662832,2014-10-21,21065461,Julianna,Bottom line: I loved everything about this airbnb experience!
I felt right at home in Andrea's Urban Oasis. She was an excellent host; if I had any questions,she was just a text away. And if you get a chance to chat with her,she is a wonderful person to talk to! Jamaica Plain is a charming area of Boston and the tiny house itself was perfect: cozy but plenty of space,beautifully and comfortably decorated,and with all the conveniences you would need (designated parking space,full bathroom
Right inside the door is a bulletin board full of local restaurants and tourist attractions (it was very nice to not have to research a place to get takeout the night of my arrival).  Keep an eye out for artistic flair throughout the house,such as the little sculptures (some of which were made by Andrea) and the clawfoot tub.,,,,
"I would stay at Urban Oasis again in a heartbeat and recommend this place to anyone!\"",,,,,
3616081,21733668,2014-10-22,22727242,Jason,My friend and I had a great time at Andreas! She was so accommodating and understanding. She went out of her way to help us. The place itself was very clean and quaint. Its very close to very good restaurants. Check out Haven and Canary Square. Thank you andrea.
3616081,21768196,2014-10-23,21406661,Drew,"Could not ask for a better place to stay. The apartment was everything I could ask for and more, not to mention Andrea was a total sweetheart and amazing host. I visit boston often and will be staying at Urban Oasis again."
3616081,21831289,2014-10-25,21264471,Troy,"We were welcomed with a delightful hostess giving us a tutorial of the apartment. All the extra touches and were provided, but band-aids, playing cards, q-tips, to a towel for my hair. The accommodations were clean, quiet and the bed was incredibly comfortable. It was wonderful to have a kitchen and washer and dryer right off the bedroom. Felt much more like home! Beats a hotel any DAY! The location was IDEAL!!!  We were just a couple of blocks away from Stony Brook train station which was a quiet, non congested neighborhood station. A+++++++++++++ Thank you so much, Andrea for being such a hospitable hostess! We will be back1"

The room was very well equipped and maintained with everything we needed in order to accommodate us and make us feel comfortable. Plus the access to a kitchen and a laundry are an added bonus. The host was very friendly and attentive to all our needs and requests and guided us through an exciting visit to Boston and Massachusetts."
3616081,22524499,2014-11-09,21190695,Marie,Very warm welcoming. Terrific neighborhood (future Brooklin !)
3616081,22656157,2014-11-11,22213602,Sameer,Andrea was helpful and friendly leading up to the trip. Unfortunately I couldn't make it to Boston but she was very understanding. Would definitely stay there again.

The heaters work great. Andrea is lovely and sweet. She always tried her best to help while we stayed in Boston. Highly recommend!!"
3616081,22889118,2014-11-17,7554883,Stephanie,"We absolutely loved staying at the Urban Oasis! The space was comfy, cute and had everything we could possibly need for our 3 night stay. Andrea was a fabulous host from the time of booking until our check out. You can tell she really takes pride in her space and loves hosting guests. We loved the little kitchen area, coffee, tea and little treats she had for us on arrival. Communication was easy and Andrea was super responsive, offering to give us suggestions for food, coffee shops etc. We'd definitely stay again!"
3616081,23000736,2014-11-19,2419590,Kim,"Wow, I'm not sure what to begin with the incredible beauty or the amenities. I don't even know how it's possible to design and carry-out both a gorgeous beach cabin as well as something that looks like a magazine cover of a cozy home meets a spa retreat. Everywhere I looked Andrea had thought of everything from where to put outlets for charging, everything a person could need for their stay, all of the information regarding the area and all the local interests as well as little treats she left for me-even though I only booked a single night! I can't imagine going to a hotel for any reason after this experience. I felt like I got double the hospitality, double the comfort, double the beauty and had the feeling of being in a luxury space just for me. The art and the decor is absolutely FABULOUS. There is even, on top of it all, a claw footed bathtub and a pounded copper vanity sink that practically made me want to live in the bathroom. Just gorgeous. All the details, all of the beautiful art and artifacts, the colors-I can't imagine people not walking in and falling head over heels in love like I did. You could do a honeymoon there and feel blessed. That good."
3616081,23138534,2014-11-23,10673733,Scarlett,"Beautiful little space stocked with most everything you might need as a traveler. Andrea was in the middle of getting everything ready for a thanksgiving party but she took the time to greet us and explain everything in the apartment. The orange line is right there which was very convenient. We only stayed one night but would have been comfortable longer! Quiet, quirky neighborhood which seemed pretty safe, saw a lot of young families and people in their 20s. Brooklyn-esque vibe I guess. Lots of appreciated little touches, like great linens, a comfy bed, the softest robes, and a little welcome basket filled with fruit, chocolates, and some toiletries. I'd recommend it!"

Urban Oasis is tranquil, beautifully designed, decorated, and stocked with quality linens, towels, and lovely toiletries, giving the bedroom and bath a spa-like feeling.  Most comfy bed ever.  Spotlessly clean. Organic coffee, teas, and even butter to eat with her delicious home-made scones and muffins are waiting for you in the well appointed kitchen space. Great restaurants, markets, and the T within easy walking distance.  I loved it here so much, that I moved upstairs to her Pink Room when this was booked for the weekend.  I travel a lot in Europe and the U.S., and I recommend highly."
3616081,25754720,2015-01-25,804532,Caroline,Andrea is wonderfully communicative and welcoming. She provided everything we could possibly need for our stay. We would definitely recommend this spot.

(see my previous reviews of Andrea's Urban Oasis and Pink Room.)  Andrea made sure that my stay was perfect, even as we weathered blizzard Juno.  Flashlights at the ready, and chili prepared to heat on the upstairs wood stove if needed.  Beautifully designed space; warm; lovely small, well stocked kitchen; most comfy bed; quality linens and toiletries.  Can't wait to stay again and see Andrea and family.  Highly recommend."
3616081,26716885,2015-02-17,3484805,Chris,"Andrea was a tremendous host from the start. We arrived at her Urban Oasis during one of Boston's countless blizzards this winter, and despite the harsh weather conditions, she immediately welcomed us with a tour. (She also did a fabulous job caring for the driveway and walking areas during the snow.)"
From here,I can only echo other reviewers and say that the space is warm and cozy at every corner. Very comfortable bed,artsy and unique appointments throughout,"and perks like Netflix / Apple TV if you're snowed in like we were for part of our trip. Andrea went above and beyond with the welcome basket and delicious muffins on our last morning at Urban Oasis. Thanks for everything.\"",,
3616081,27009101,2015-02-23,9820671,Daniel,"Andrea was an absolutely wonderful host! She took great care to take sure we felt welcome-- from thoughtful recommendations to what to do around town, to helping plan a surprise birthday for my girlfriend during the trip, to little things like making fresh scones for breakfast. Being from Las Vegas, Boston's record-setting snow was a hugely different experience for us, and Andrea made sure we were prepared and ready to have a great trip. The apartment itself was amazing-- cozy, comfortable, and inviting, it was absolutely perfect. I cannot recommend Andrea-- and especially her Urban Oasis-- enough. Thank you, Andrea!"

The kitchen is well stocked and the eating area is perfectly adequate for quick bites,but I wouldn't try to do any significant cooking or eating there. We ordered dinner in and ate at the small desk. It worked,but would get tiring for more than a meal or two. But with so many great restaurants in the neighborhood,why bother (unless there's five feet of snow on the ground!)?,,

The apartment was very seriously immaculate and exactly as described.  It was a wonderful space in a great area.  Getting into town was quick and easy and Jamaica Plain has its own entertainment.,,,,,

Not only because the place is beautiful, comfortable, with an incredible comfy bed and designed with great care and sense for spaces, but because it is cozy and feels like a second home. But more than anything because of Andrea, your host, who is welcoming, charming, respectful and always available."
The apartment is seriously immaculate,easygoing,full of artsy details,plenty of electric hookups and exactly as described.  Located in Jamaica Plains,near the subway and with shops and restaurants close by makes,it even more appealing

The location is great as well - very close to a train station that takes you right into the heart of the city. I would not hesitate to recommend Andrea's Urban Oasis to anyone looking to stay in Boston."
3616081,32878212,2015-05-23,10749540,Kathleen,"Andrea has created a lovely space for s single guest or couple. Additionally she went out of her way to create a separate comfortable private space within her personal art studio to accommodate our daughter, Andrea is meticulously clean and the bedding was very high quality. I sleep on a down pillow at home and usually travel with it because other pillows are too high or too hard, I forgot my pillow and was ready to sleep with no pillow. Andrea had down pillows in addition to foam, so whatever you like, you will be comfortable. The coffee was organic - thank you Andrea- you hit the mark there too without having met me! The space is small but but very well though out and appointed. Andrea thought of everything. The little garden outside your door is lovely and you're very close to Centre Street and Stony Brook  train station. Love JP, book with Andrea."

3616081,34705476,2015-06-11,31163527,Madeleine,We had a wonderful stay at Urban Oasis and I would thoroughly recommend staying here.
Our train was delayed which meant that we didn't arrive until much later than anticipated. Andrea was very accommodating and made suitable arrangements for when we arrived.,,,,,
We had the guided tour of the apartment and everything was thoroughly explained and essentials were provided for us on arrival. Urban oasis itself is only a short,5min walk from the subway station,which connects you to Central Boston. This was super easy and the instructions on how to find Urban Oasis were really clear. The apartment has a real cosy feel to it and the bed was really comfortable. It was a perfect location and a perfect little hub for us to come back to after a long day in the city. Jamaica Plain is a lovely neighbourhood with lots of interesting houses (very different to British houses) so we enjoyed wandering down through it to Jamaica Pond and sitting by the water.,,,
Andrea was most welcoming and we had the chance to have a good chat also. She was very knowledgable and was really helpful when we asked for lots of recommendations and things to do. She has made a book full of information on restaurants,sights and tourist attractions which was also great to peruse.,,,,

Other than that the place is perfect for anyone traveling to Boston. Very easy access to the train system"

She has gone above and beyond to ensure that her guests are equipped with everything that is necessary (and more) to enjoy their stay and all the great things Boston has to offer. Andrea was extremely welcoming and even suggested some great local visits which made the trip that more special. In addition to this, Andrea has also set up a well thought-out board at the entrance of her oasis, which gave us great ideas of how to see all of Boston in one weekend. It is also extremely well located, we were able to easily get around with the train station using a Charlie Card. The room was extremely clean and very beautifully decorated.

We pulled up and she was there to greet us with her adorable granddaughter, we got a quick and simple tour of the house and we were on our way to exploring Boston. Andrea left us a folder of places to go, directions and even brochures of things to do. She has a very helpful bulletin board right by the door  with maps of the train system and how to get there and places around the area of Jamaica plain. The neighborhood is a cute quiet one but the train is a block away and we were in the heart of Boston in 10 minutes. Andrea is the sweetest most awesome host, she constantly made sure we were perfect throughout the trip and asked how she can make any party of our stay better. She also left us a little welcome basket with organic washes and a snack. The house is clean as ever and is set up adorably, bed is super comfy with sun out shades so the bedroom is dark throughout the day, the kitchen is adorable and stocked with anything you'd ever need.

Everything was clean and every detail was fabulous. The bulletin board near the front door is filled with directions to great sites and restaurants, even take-out ideas and info about the community. We were a short walk away from great places to eat and a CVS, among other shops. The T is so close, which made it convenient for us to wake up early and travel throughout the city to all of the places we wanted to go. Making our way back after a long day was very easy. The bed is the perfect size and so comfortable--it was so nice after getting back from a long day of walking around and exploring Boston. The filtered water, cream, and coffee was something I was grateful for too! With the electric kettle and french press in the kitchen, I was able to make a nice cup of coffee to start the day. There is also an array of teas and sugar to choose from too. Most of what you might need you will find here, there are even extra towels and linens. Overall, this is a wonderful place to stay and the area is safe and quiet. We had our privacy during our stay, but Andrea was available for any questions and she was so nice and helpful, and checked in with us to make sure we were doing well! She made us feel welcome and we were happy to meet her--you can tell that she loves what she does because it shows! Next time we stay in Boston, we will definitely choose the Urban Oasis. :)"

Andrea had provided us with quick tour of the place upon check-in to ensure we knew where everything was. The kitchenette was fully functional with all the utensils if you wanted to cook. It was clean and nicely decorated. Andrea is very detailed oriented and provided all the comfort you would find at home. Location felt safe and only 5 min walk from Stony Brook T stop and about 15min train ride to downtown. I recommend the Urban Oasis for your stay in Boston!

Andrea is one of the nicest woman I've met and is dedicated to the lodgers' well being (my friend is slightly handicapped and even though the place is not specifically made for handicapable people, she helped us and made sure she was very comfortable throughout our stay) and for that we can't praise her enough. I have been treated better at the urban oasis than I've ever been at a hotel or renting cottages for vacations. She is easy to talk to and interested in getting to know you and what you're doing in the city, which makes you feel much safer to have someone there to help you.

Knowing how hot and muggy it can be in Boston in late summer we checked for A/C along with our other listing-search requirements like an efficiency kitchen and a queen bed."
Not only was the kitchen efficient it was well-stocked and CLEAN,as was the bathroom. And the A/C isn't a noisy window unit,it's central air at Andrea's. Big plus for us.,,,
Check-in was thorough and pleasant. Everything you see in the listing photos is accurate. Andrea was super,easy to communicate with and ready to make sure everything was to our liking there.,,,,
We loved discovering the JP neighborhoods,stores and restaurants. The Sam Adams brewery is within a 10 min. walk and a T-stop is just 5 minutes up the road.,,,,

All conveniently located in Jamaica Plain--walkable with excellent dining (Tres Gatos & Canary Square) and great coffee & wine at City Feed & Supply."
Our host,Andrea,is all about a good experience for her guests. We felt so pampered!,,,
Off street parking is a real plus.,,,,,

3616081,45459875,2015-09-03,25473729,Jacquelyn,"Where to begin... As a first time user of AirBNB, I couldn't have asked for more calm, inviting and  beautiful area and space to stay in for me and my partner."
Andrea met us when we arrived and opened her warm and playful home to us after going through the house and explaining how everything worked,where things were and didn't hesitate to make herself available if needed. I enjoyed a few mornings on the porch with my coffee and computer and  I have never slept on a bed so magnificent and comfortable!,,,,
The neighborhood,is just a wonderful place for families,young professionals and students. My partner and I enjoyed late night and early morning walks around the neighborhood. It was safe and truly felt as though we were walking down our streets at home. People are friendly,there are plenty of boutiques and places to eat delicious food a the magnificent City Feed and Supply store just a  10/15 minute walk for delicious coffee and organic goods. The T is also within a 5 minute walk distance so going into the hustle and bustle of the city was easy.,,
I could go on about this absolutely stunning area and host. I hope many come and stay as I know we will be back!,,,,,

Andrea greeted us on arrival and showed us where everything was and how everything worked. Andrea is a wonderful host  and has fantastic knowledge of the area. We tried a lot of the recommendations and they were great, and sadly we missed out on some homemade scones!"
The space itself is wonderful. It's like a treasure trove! It is lovely and clean and has everything you could think of that you might need! Take time to read the information that has been put together and collected as it really helped us decide where to eat/places to visit.,,,,,
We really liked the fact that you had your own space,but Andrea was just at the end of the phone if we needed her.,,,,
Me and my husband would come and stay again the next time we are in Boston,"we loved it!\"",,,,
3616081,48232806,2015-09-24,8463214,Tommy,"Our stay at the Urban Oasis was wonderful. Andrea's attention to detail shows throughout the space. The bed is comfortable and having the off street parking is very convenient. The train station is very close and convenient to get to, which takes you right downtown without much hassle. Highly recommended!!"
3616081,49861560,2015-10-06,45373084,Hudson,"Great place so conveniently located in Jamaican Plain. Only steps from the subway it was the perfect place to base by adventures for Boston. Andrea's place was cute and cozy, and she was a wonderful hostess."

We were very welcomed to the Urban Retreat by Andrea ! The property is located in a cheerful,soulful neighborhood with older homes,mature trees,vegetable and herb gardens.,,
The unit is completely tasteful and peaceful. It has a true retreat character - somewhat like a cozy and uncluttered hobbit hole opening onto a beautiful stone patio.,,,,,
I loved the deep window well in the bedroom with room for a carry on suitcase and spreading out jewelry,"etc. This \"\"dressing spot\"\" is immediately adjacent to the closet which is very useful. The bed and it's appointments are superior quality.",,,,
Everything a guest might need while traveling had been thought of in this unit - down to the last delightful detail.,,,,,
Thank you Andrea !,,,,,
"Billie \"",,,,,
3616081,51017016,2015-10-17,20880720,Jane,We really enjoyed our stay in Urban Oasis. Andrea was more than helpful both prior to our arrival and during our 3 day visit.
The snug,semi-basement apartment is based in Jamaica Plain,an ethnically diverse area with an Hispanic emphasis and slightly hippy feel. We felt perfectly safe walking from Urban Oasis up to the restaurant and local shopping street,about a 10 minute stroll.,,
The Orange T line train is only a couple of minutes away making the trip Downtown very easy.,,,,,
The journey time from the airport was around 20 minutes and cost about $35 though the city train service would have been quite quick and MUCH cheaper! But after a long flight a taxi is so much easier.,,,,,
The accommodation is spotless painted in pale lemon and blue - very restful! From the private front door there is an entrance hall with a corridor running past the bathroom and  the bedroom to the kitchen. In the tiny bathroom the thick fluffy white towels are a joy,the shower effective and the essentials are all provided - shampoo and body wash,hairdryer. Also iron and ironing board,sewing kit etc. The double bed is comfy and has an Apple TV connected to Netflix and Wifi is efficient.,,
Being a sub-basement,you can hear Andrea,the dog and any family or visitors wandering about upstairs. This is not particularly intrusive just worth a mention.,,,
Our only slight complaint is that the accommodation is rather cramped so there is no where to sit comfortably and the small table and chair is by the front door. This means that you watch TV in bed,read in bed and use the laptop in bed.,,,,
The dehumidifier runs off and on as does the instant hot water system. This is not really annoying but there is a humming of one sort or another for a lot of the time.,,,,,
"I would certainly recommend staying here with Andrea and we loved the quiet neighbourhood and our warm welcome. Andrea is a lovely host.\"",,,,,
3616081,51332081,2015-10-19,44926296,Raechel,"Andrea made us feel welcome even before we got to the location! She was in contact with us through our travel experience and was helpful with directions to her home when the trains weren't running between a handful of stops on the Orange line. We made it, and she was very accommodating. Her space was a home away from home. She provides you with everything that you need to make your experience warm. We love the neighborhood! Very creative old restored homes. Wonderful restaurants in the area, and perfect for public transit. Andrea even went out of her way to make a brunch reservation for us at Tres Gatos, a local Tapas place in Jamaica Plains. It was only a ten minute walk! The Orange Line was a breeze for us to access, and you can get to down town Boston in 15-20 min depending on your destination. We would absolutely book again! It was charming and private, great for a long great away weekend for my boyfriend and I. I would definitely book the Urban Oasis when I stop by Boston in the near future. She takes a lot pride is her space, and really cares about your stay."
3616081,51524187,2015-10-21,35225039,Nicola,"We had a great stay. Andrea was incredibly welcoming, and the place was great. She'd made the most of the space, so we had everything we needed. Washing machine and dryer were a real bonus for our trip. Parking right outside, and the T connection really easy to get to. We took Andrea's advice on a local restaurant (she has loads of info about the local area) and it was excellent. We loved our stay and would definitely recommend this as a great place to stay."
3616081,52067222,2015-10-26,43134596,Julie,"The Urban Oasis was a perfect location for our family vacation to Boston.  Andrea walked to meet us as we arrived on the T. She gave us a brief tour of her cozy place which was extremely tidy, clean, and comfortable.  We had everything we needed for our 3 night stay.   We had great access to the T and to many restaurants in Jamaica Plain."
3616081,53242823,2015-11-07,34481917,Brock,Andrea was the perfect host. My girlfriend and I sayed at Andrea's house for 6 nights and we couldnt complain. Andrea was always just a text or a call away and was very helpful with any and all questions we had.
Her suggestions for things to do were great and the location was very easy to get to and from.,,,,,

3616081,53531087,2015-11-09,8925318,Louise,"Compact meticulously clean lodgings with comfortable bed and all the little details; kitchen with light breakfast items and refrigerator.  We stayed for two nights while visiting family and touring Boston, and it was perfect for this.  Andrea's house is set back from the road so there's no urban car noise.  The orange line Stony Brook stop is a 5 minute walk."
3616081,53795307,2015-11-12,6206488,Ned,"Great host! Very friendly, meticulous and attentive, but gives you your space. The living space is super cool and comfortable and has great vibe. And if you are from out of town there is no better neighborhood to be in. I actually ended up moving from the Urban Oasis (because it was booked) to the Pink Room and have enjoyed that space a lot as well."
3616081,54307066,2015-11-18,35323009,David,"Fantastic time in Boston. Andrea is a superb host with a gorgeous little hideaway just a short stop from Boston city centre, There really is no need to stay in central Boston when there is fabulous accommodation such as Andrea's 10 minutes from the city hub. The apartment had everything you could ask for and Jamaica plain is a cute little hamlet not far from Boston with some stunning restaurants; check out Tres Gatos. Couldn't recommend this accommodation more highly."
3616081,55734074,2015-12-05,9425152,Jane,"The urban oasis may be small but it has everything you'll need while in Boston, including a washer and dryer that allows you to return home with a suitcase full of clean clothes! Andrea truly goes above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable and have everything you need. I feel she has really thought through each detail to make your stay enjoyable."

Cozy, comfortable and super clean it was just what we needed for a private getaway space while spending time with our daughter and family, grandchild and new early arrival baby. It allowed us to show up fresh every morning and help out those tired new parents. Everything was exactly as described and Andrea was super available and helpful."
3616081,65188100,2016-03-11,59100106,Michael,"This was only my second AirBnB experience but it was superb.  Two things really stand out -- Andrea the host (her warmth and attention to detail) and the space (amazingly clean, efficient, functional).  I don't know Boston well either but the neighborhood was very close to the subway, had a bunch of interesting restaurants, coffee shops, and other businesses, and overall had an artsy, funky, great vibe."
3616081,66004674,2016-03-18,51006903,Liang,Great place with everything that makes you feel like home! Descent decoration with mini kitchen where you can cook like your home.

She greeted us (with the cutest cat in the universe) warmly and showed us around the house. The house has a cozy front yard and the house itself is so cute and has everything(literally). It's absolutely clean and secured. The house is full of details that make you feel like home and it's very artsy. Especially like the info board that has all kinds of maps of the city and attractions, and her book full of information and former guests' advice."
"She has the best taste in biscuit flavor. And we just love the her choice of hand wash and body lotion ;) We'll definitely come back to explore more of the lovely neighborhood and the city.\"",,,,,
3616081,66812676,2016-03-24,63297642,Dongni,Andrea is a fantastic host. She is super caring and sweet. Urban Oasis is small but cozy and has lovely decoration. It has everything you ever needed.

Definitely a great experience at Andrea's Urban Oasis! Highly recommend!
3616081,67252303,2016-03-27,1792703,Beth & Tom,"The Urban Oasis is a charming mini-flat, thoughtfully designed and lovingly cared for.  Andrea is a lovely host, and her attention to detail is evident throughout - from an immaculately clean space, to a basket of essentials, to a variety of tea options, to fluffy fresh towels, to Apple TV.  The queen size bed is super comfy, and although this is a converted walk-out basement space .... there is a lot of light coming in.  The garden is private and there is a dedicated off-street parking spot.  The JP neighborhood of Boston is hip, diverse and happening.  Andrea is committed to ensuring her guests have an excellent stay, and communicates clearly.  She was friendly and welcoming, but also allowed privacy.  Two thumbs up - a warm and cozy stay at Andrea's Urban Oasis."

The location of the house is perfect; right next to a subway stop that leads you straight into downtown Boston. The place was immaculate and very comfy. She met us on time and gave us a quick tour of the accommodations and all the little extras included,(beyond what is in the posting). Too many to list here but things like coffee in the kitchen, robes, shampoos and soaps; the list goes on. Just fantastic. The host has a bulletin board and all sorts of pamphlets on things to see and do all over Boston, from the local neighbourhood and the city centre. If one or two are going to Boston for a few days or more, this is the place to stay. No doubt about it!"

Andrea paid attention to many small details to make the stay a good one, and the apartment is well-equipped with basic amenities for travelers.  The location of the apartment is also excellent (close to the Orange Line and many fun restaurants in Jamaica Plain!) and Andrea provides good advice about the local neighborhood so that her guests can experience the place they're in.

Although the apartment was small and not very bright due to being a basement unit, it was tastefully decorated and thoughtfully stocked with the essentials plus more as well as tea, coffee and even a rain poncho and umbrella should it be needed."
Plenty of useful local information helps get around the neighbourhood.  The bed was very comfortable,the temperature nice and cool on warm summer days,and the bathroom functional if a bit cramped. On the plus side,the water was hot and plenty of it!,,
I didn't use the kitchen but it has everything you need if you do. I suspect tall people would have some challenges. If you need space to spread out and work be aware that there is only a small table near the entrance to do,(not counting the outside seat and table in the front garden) as there is no living room to speak of.  However,if none of the above apply then all in all it was a decent alternative to a frightfully expensive hotel,and Andrea was a marvelous host.,,

"Andrea's description and pictures of the apartment are spot-on!  It is perfect for one person or a couple.  It worked perfectly for my daughter and me once we worked out a bathroom \"\"schedule\"\" which turned out to be no problem at all.",,,,,
Andrea is lovely to work with and answers any questions or texts very quickly...often times within minutes!  She also has a wall that is seen in the pictures which gives the guest(s) ideas of local places in the very cool area of Jamaica Plain.,,,,,
I just loved the fact that I could park my car off the street in a dedicated space and walk through an opening in a fenced off area into a private space with plants,"an outdoor \"\"cafe\"\" table",and the private entrance to the apartment.,,,
"Andrea met us personally when we arrived and showed us EVERYTHING we needed to know about the apartment.  She also provides a very detailed \"\"Particulars Letter\"\" with all necessary information you can refer to if needed.  She respects guests' wishes as to how much contact or privacy to provide.

I chose her place because it was only 10 minutes away from daughter who does not have a guest room. The neighborhood has a lot to offer: restaurants, shops, places to go for a walk, close proximity to the subway. Andrea was a very attentive host, always making sure I was comfortable and she was willing to offer a helping hand. When the neighborhood lost power, she kept me well informed of what was going on. She loves and knows her neighborhood and provided a lot of material of what there was to do, where to eat, and where to shop. Before my arrival she put yoghurt and cold water in the fridge. Even though I  did not take advantage of her book collection, it is a nice touch. I would stay there again on future trips to Boston."

I expected the noise to be an issue (due to the central location) but as I generally go to sleep around midnight there were no noise issues by that time."

She was able to make an exception and allow both my fiancé and I to stay, which we are so thankful for since we were having trouble finding a reasonably priced place near the wedding we were attending. It's about a 25 minute walk to Copley Square and public transport is really close. We didn't get to see her much since we were so busy, but Diana was really friendly and laid back and the room was big and comfortable! If I come back to Boston, I'll absolutely stay here again."

The apartment was well fitted with everything needed and had great views. Located about a block from 2 different T stops and a short walk to South Station made this property ideal.
2821921,49514916,2015-10-04,38666567,Salvatore,"The apartment was just as described, very nice.  Great location.  Andrew and the team at Seamless made the booking very easy and worked with us to find dates to accommodate our business traveler. A+ experience."

The apartment, 1st   floor, was a bit noisy but not overly so and the back deck was nice especially for breakfast in the sun, plenty of room for 4 people  with two living areas and a good kitchen. The place was very clean and tidy on our arrival ."
"The place is in South End but there are better areas of the locality closer by the apartment.   \"",,,,,
1342370,8487086,2013-11-02,9155515,Dennis,Booking and gaining access to the property was a very easy experience. The apartment itself was clean and had everything we needed without being spectacular. It is on the egde of a very nice area though you will probably will only want to walk in one direction. I would stay here again.

Will was a great host - getting in and out was no hassle at all. I'll definitely stay here again the next time I'm in town.
1342370,10480870,2014-02-21,6569874,Petteri,Very nice apartment in nice neighborhood. We were 6 people and had no problems fitting in. Would consider staying again.
1342370,11074199,2014-03-19,11738146,Paul,"Lovely apartment in a great location in Boston, within walking distance of the Prudential Center and Fenway Park. Everything was clean and the place was kitted out with everything you need for a short stay."
Excellent communication from Will,he responded to all my advance queries and ensured we had all the required information.,,,,
"Highly recommended. Thanks!\"",,,,,

This appartement in Boston was conveniently located, a spacious kitchen, divine beds and precious terrace. Wifi provided the necessary connectivity. Only pay attention if you travel at full capacity: as indicated there is only 1 bathroom ;-)"
Overall,"I would advise this place to everyone travelling to Boston for a couple of days!\"",,,,
1342370,11653661,2014-04-10,6675669,Rob,"I arranged a two night stay at Will's place at very short notice. Will was quick to respond and very helpful and easy to deal with. Check-in was very easy and the apartment was great. It's good value, in a great location for exploring the city and there are lots of interesting places to eat and drink nearby. Good location for Fenway Park too. We didn't use the deck much as it was quite chilly but in the warmer months it would be a nice place to hang out. Thanks Will."
1342370,11788292,2014-04-15,7303928,John,"Great location! The neighborhood was welcoming and we were near several public transit stops which made our trip easy. The accommodations were exactly what the listings and images promised. Comfortable beds, nice couch, and a lovely patio. Parking seems tricky but if you are driving in there are adjacent streets that don't require permit parking, which saves a lot of headache."
"A great place to stay if your coming in with a group. We stayed with six and it was plenty of space. \"",,,,,

A colleague and I were in town for a conference and the apartment worked out great, its only a 5 minute drive to the Seaport convention center, parking is easy before say 7pm and there are a bunch of good places to eat right near Mass Ave.  I would definitely consider staying at Will's apartment again when I'm in Boston.  Neighbors upstairs mad some noise one day but in the city it is to be expected."
1342370,13272055,2014-05-24,12532420,Yi Ting,The apt is very beautiful and clean and in nice neighborhood!
1342370,13740514,2014-06-03,13584051,Kellie,Wills apartment is truly a beautiful space. The updated kitchen was lovely and we especially enjoyed the back patio! The location is very convenient--just a short walk to several T stations making it easy to go anywhere in the city in just minutes. We even enjoyed a walk to Fenway Park while we were there!
The only drawback (which has nothing to do with the actual apartment) is the neighborhood can be a little noisy,especially on a Saturday night. However,that's to be expected in any big city.,,,
I was also very impressed that,even with check in being at 4pm,the management company had no problem letting us in the unit a little early to leave our bags so we didn't have to cart them around with us everywhere we went.,,,
All in all,"we were very impressed with the unit and would definitely consider staying again the next time we're in Boston.\"",,,,
1342370,15090059,2014-07-02,3132784,Sandra,"Great stay in Wills apartment in the south end. Location was favorable for walking to nice restaurants nearby, Fenway Park, and the T orange line. We felt safe in the apartment and it was comfortable. Enjoyed a 5 mile run route to the Charles River one morning which Will suggested in the welcome book.  Had concerns with luggage storage during check in/check out, and Will was responsive to our concerns. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
1342370,15158986,2014-07-03,16684930,David,This house was terrific.  It was within walking distance to Fenway and very close to the airport.  I highly recommend this house if you're staying in Boston.  I would love to stay again next time I visit.  There are lots of things to do within walking distance or a short taxi ride away.
1342370,15222907,2014-07-05,14889809,Yang,"Will's house is a pretty nice place to stay and even better than I expected. Quiet, convenient and easy to get somewhere around the city. We should have brought something for cooking because there is a big kitchen in it."
1342370,16298152,2014-07-25,14303406,Roman,A very nice apartment equipped with all you need and clean. It is in a typical row house that makes your stay like you'd be living in Boston for a few days. The location is great. You can get to downtown either by bus (around the corner) or walk a few minutes to the orange line. There are restaurants and stores in walking distance.
You enter the house and apartment by entering codes so there is no exchange of keys,..  This all worked perfectly.,,,,
The only thing we can say is that you hear the street very good in one of the bedrooms,"but the street is not that busy at night. And you are in the city...\"",,,,
1342370,18049409,2014-08-21,1655652,Megan,"The unit is great and the photos are very accurate. It's a fabulous place to stay in the summer because of the back patio. A few great restaurants nearby, and two close T-train stations within walking distance. I would definately recommend this place to friends who are visiting Boston in the future."
1342370,18233140,2014-08-24,4944939,Barbara & Christian,Everything was perfect! The apartment is beautiful and spacious and having a terrasse in the middle of a city is very special. The neighborhood is quiet  but you are in walking distance to downtown and other sightseeing musts. Will provided us with all the information needed and ist was very easy to check in and out.
We had a really wonderful stay! THANX,,,,,

Will svarte raskt på meldinger, og vi opplevde ingen problemer i det hele tatt, hverken med utleieren eller selve leiligheten. Ville så absolutt bodd her igjen."

1342370,19552165,2014-09-14,5603683,Genie,Great apartment! Four of us stayed here and it was very comfortable. The deck is a nice touch.
1342370,21347174,2014-10-15,20722414,Yogev,A prime location. Spacious and comfortable apartment. Reasonable walking distance from all Boston attractions. Roomier than what you would expect from a center of city apartment. Kitchen and bathroom in great condition. Good internet connection and zillion of TV channels. Main bedroom mattress is on the plush side so be aware if your back is sensitive for those.
This is ground floor apartment in middle of city so you will be getting street noise.,,,,,
Note you are dealing with a a management company and not a private lender,but that's not a big issue and they were responsive to our needs.,,,,
If you are driving with a car be aware parking is a challenge and all neighboring streets are for registered residents only. We have rented a parking space from the management company,reasonably priced and close enough to the apartment.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1342370,22944582,2014-11-18,20485998,Birgir,We never meet anyone. Only got email prior to our arrival with the codes to the doors.
We came six together and I got informations that there would be towels and pillows for everyone. That was not true since there were only 5 towels in the apartment.,,,,,
There are also only 3 small plates and 5 coffee mugs but 6 bigger plates and some glasses.,,,,,
The sleeper sofa is broken but we found some air mattress to use instead.,,,,,
At arrival we also noticed that the cleaning had not been that great with something sticky on the counter top and few very dirty glasses in the cabinet.,,,,,
We could leave our luggage in the apartment until 2pm that was very good for us and I noticed that the cleaning was much better after our stay. We saw that when we got back to the apartment to get the luggage.,,,,,
Location is good. Not that far distance to Newbury St.,,,,,
The washing machine smells really badly.,,,,,
"So to sum it up then it was a OK place to stay because of location but it was not as clean as we would hope for and I am not the \"\"always\"\" cleaning type of person but if you would be coming to stay at my apartment I would at least have it clean for you (specially for this price per night)\"",,,,,
1342370,23130100,2014-11-23,19068063,Andrei,"Nice location, good place to stay, clean kitchen with everything that you would need. A bit challenge parking your car, but not a big problem. Apartment is actually smaller and darker at night than what is pictured using wide-angle lens camera. 2nd bedroom is rather small, kids would stay there okay, bed is too small for adults. Inflatable mattress worked fine. Porch and dining room are nice but not used in colder months (no heat in dining room). All of this makes it rather expensive rental (beware of cleaning fee and only 1 bathroom). Though it works for 1-2 nights stay in Boston."
1342370,27355667,2015-03-02,2905083,Louis,I was very pleased with our stay at Will's place. Nice cozy little place and located perfectly to hop around town. Easy check in and out. It was just as described and he even picked up a collapsible crib for my daughter. I will look forward to visiting Boston in the summer and will book again.

This was much more a business transaction than someone welcoming us into their home but that's perfectly fine. The apartment was almost exactly what we were expecting - so that was nice!! It's a great apartment in a decent location. Knowing Boston"

1342370,42119760,2015-08-11,29396386,John,This is a management company rental so you don't have any contact with them. That apartment is in a good location just a couple of mins from the T. It is clean and spacious but they only provide the bare minimum of paper products and towels. Overall a good place to stay.
1342370,44653122,2015-08-28,14540077,Molly,"I stayed in this home with two work colleagues during a conference at Harvard Medical School. I'm sure that the T would have made our morning/evening commute shorter, but the 1.5 mile walk through NorthEastern was perfectly fine for us. Having only one bathroom, it was a bit cramped for three coworkers (we were all on the same daily schedule). The house was clean and comfortable, close to many markets and restaurants. Having keyless entry was extremely convenient! During our stay, the pull-out bed was not working, but that was totally fine for me. The back porch was great for relaxing and enjoying breakfast in the summer air."

Apartment was comfortable and well equipped. One slight hiccup with sofa bed, we'd suggest checking it on arrival. We had a great time - thanks Will!"
1342370,52403679,2015-10-29,9493829,(EMAIL HIDDEN),Pro's:The apt is exactly as pictured- the back patio would be lovely in nice weather but we didnt have the opportunity to enjoy it.  The location is relatively convenient but still a walk to many of the restaurants and cafes in the area.  The fold out couch in the living area is super comfortable I am told.  They were able to arrange for a pack-n-play for my daughter so I didn't have to fly with one.
Con's: The street itself is slightly sketchy and several uber drivers advised against walking around there at night.  This is a street facing first floor apartment so it is quite loud- anyone going to the basement or upstairs or just entering the building is very clearly heard and the front door slams super loudly and makes the walls shake.  The apartment is very bare-bones,"its not your typical airbnb.  If you want to prepare your own food which I think is a great advantage of a place like this you literally have to buy EVERYTHING- there is no salt/pepper/oils etc...and no walkable grocery store unfortunately.  \"",,,,
1342370,53202740,2015-11-06,47110194,Fernando,This was my second Airbnb experience.
The apartment looks like it is exclusively used for Airbnb renting. So the experience is a little different from my first Airbnb reservation,where the hosts where very welcoming and inviting. In this one,I didn't have any interaction with anyone.,,,
I stayed with a group of friends,we just wanted a comfortable place to stay in Boston. We were out for most of the time,so the listing served its purpose.,,,
The pictures depicted in the listing are true in the sense that everything you see there,is in the apartment. But not as pristine as the pictures may lead you to believe. I'm not saying that the place is dirty,I'm just saying that the bedding,the walls,seats,and others
The electronic door system is a plus,it helped me and my friends get in and out of the apartment without having to deal with keys. The outdoor terrace is also a plus,it is a quiet place to just enjoy the good weather that we had and eat a little something.,,,
Location was great,there's a lot of nearby places to eat and drink. We mostly used Uber everywhere we went,but it seemed that everywhere we went,it was not a long/hard ride back to the apartment.,,
If I were to make another trip to Boston with a group of friends,I would probably try this listing again. If I were to have a more private trip,say with my girlfriend,"I would maybe look for another option.\"",,
1342370,55952210,2015-12-07,17596420,Ashley,"This apt is managed by a company so there was no interaction with the host or anyone else. This made check in and check out easy. My only complaint is that the apartment is not in the best shape- it was clean (sanitary sheets and towels) but there were broken glasses in the kitchen cabinet when we arrived, stains on the rugs and walls everywhere, rips in the barstools, etc... These were minor things that did not affect our visit- but the apt seems overpriced for such poor quality furnishings and overall care. Additionally it was cold and we never could figure out how to adjust the temperature with the thermostat. Location however is great and was the main reason for choosing this apt."
1342370,58023418,2015-12-31,6834149,Ya,"The apartment is located in a convenient location, closed to subway station and bus station. Probably the building is quite historical, it is easy to hear the noise outside the apartment."

We did not encounter the hosts. Our only complaint is that the fold out couch is broken and not usable for 2 people. They should take that off of the listing. It is a great place for 4 people but not 6. There is a nice air mattress , but really no room anywhere to lay it out."
1342370,76484597,2016-05-27,66031456,Diana,"Very pleased with my experience at this Airbnb! There was absolutely no hassle with checking in/checking out, the apartment was clean and had absolutely everything we needed. The location was pretty convenient for both the Boston area and to commute to Cambridge, and street parking nearby was available after some searching. Just wanted to point out that the walls in the building are pretty thin so you could hear a lot of noise from other units at night. I had ear plugs with me, if you are a light sleeper, I recommend bringing those."
1342370,78833870,2016-06-09,71688870,Carrie,"The apartment is well furnished and clean.  The place can sleep 6, but I wouldn't recommend it.  The pull out sofa is a little dingy to sleep on and is very uncomfortable.  There are also exactly 6 of everything (6 towels, 6 coffee mugs, etc), so you'll need to do lots of washing in order to use the items.  Everything is very minimalistic - there's an iron, but no ironing board, there's flatware, but only the minimum, etc.  And while you can cook, there's very little to work with.  Some of the pots and pans have broken handles, so you'll need to get creative.  And there was only pepper, a small thing of dish soap, and a few dishwashing pods.  We had a comfortable enough stay, but had to get a bit creative to make it all work."
The neighborhood itself is up and coming still.  I found it safe and the location was good.,,,,,

He was also kind to add a third additional spot for our friend who joined at the last minute. The house is well linked to the city center (2 subway green line stops nearby). Bed linen were quite clean (except the wool blanket which we didn't use). The bathroom was not so clean but in overall the stay was worth the price we paid.
10995976,67170637,2016-03-27,8712405,Jing,It was a cozy little room and good location inside Boston. It takes 10-15 mins walk to several nearest stations. 20-30mins walk to the heart of Boston. Seif was a nice guy and we had a great time there.

It is very conveniently located: you just have to walk across the park to go to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is very close too, and you can easily go to the city center or Cambridge. The room was clean, with wifi and a guide to Boston for international travelers waiting for me. It is totally worth the price. Thank you for your hospitality!"

The only drawback was the noise and light shining in from the rest of the apartment at times. It's an older apartment in the city, so set your expectations."

10995976,73778969,2016-05-10,67001701,Sathiji,I think the most honest review I can make is that I would definitely stay with Seif and Abubakr again. They are relaxed and a wealth of knowledge if you need it.
I was on my own and the room was more than enough space and there is a dresser with 2 of 3 draws that can be used (for those that don't want to live out of their suitcase).,,,,,
There was fresh bed linen and towels. The room is warm.,,,,,
There are some excellent running trails around the city and by the river.,,,,,
The room is perfectly located in the centre of Fenway and minutes from the Longwood Medical Area (where I was working). Boylston is a street with a variety of excellent places to eat. I frequented the Neighbourhoods cafe which is 2 mins away.,,,,,
The shower is powerful and warm.,,,,,
The Wifi is fast and reliable.,,,,,

10995976,74417169,2016-05-15,32668754,Ray,This was a wonderful experience and the location could not have been better! The bed was comfortable and Seif made us feel welcome and right at home. We came in town for a couple of ballgames at Fenway and everything worked out perfect! $11 Uber pool from/to the airport. I would recommend this place to anyone! Thanks Seif for everything!!!
10995976,75427386,2016-05-21,63466185,Nick,"The room is located in the heart of Boston, and about 15 mins walk from subway station. Everything is alright."
10995976,77239349,2016-05-30,38102640,Ingrid,Notre hôte est arrivé en retard de 20mn. Ensuite aucun accueil. Il n a pas présenté l appartement. On a du lui demander nous même les clefs. Et ce fut le dernier contact du séjour. Durée de notre échange avec lui à peine 2mn le temps de monter à l appartement.
Salle de bain et cuisine horriblement sale.,,,,,
Crotte de nez sur le mur de la salle de bain... Des tonnes de poussières. Frigo et gazinière trop sale pour pouvoir les utiliser. Table de la cuisine pas nettoyée.,,,,,
La chambre : Lit non fait et sans draps adaptés. Le draps house faisait office de drap. Et pas de protège matelas. Des poussières sur le sol.,,,,,
Loin du métro et du bus. Il faut 15\20mn de marche à pied.,,,,,
Bref,à éviter,,,,
"Prix beaucoup trop élevé \"",,,,,
10995976,77573280,2016-06-01,3426502,David,Located near to Fenway Park and near the Museum of Art.  Seif was not there but communicated promptly per text.  Was greeted and shown the room by the roommate Abubakr who was friendly and answered questions about sightseeing and suggested activities.
10995976,77807773,2016-06-03,32385139,Martha,Seif's place is perfect if you want a great location and need just the bare minimum. We easily explored Boston by train and foot from his location - in a great area!
10995976,78082223,2016-06-05,43676414,Kathryn,Seif was a great host. Room was comfortable and super convenient. Would definitely stay again.
10995976,79998351,2016-06-15,41509164,Yufei,"I stayed 6 nights at Seif's place and it was a great journey at Boston. The location is great! Located at Fenway Park and three subway stations(Kenmore, Fenway and Museum of Fine Arts) all within walking distance. The room was exactly as described, cozy clean and airy. Did not have too many chances to talk to Seif but he tried his best to accommodate us. Though we shared the apartment but I did not get disturbed at all. For this unbeaten price,  staying here is one of the best thing that made my trip fantastic! Will come back!"
10995976,81702466,2016-06-24,67747803,Clayton,The location was great and Seif was kind enough to allow me to check in early.
10995976,82995554,2016-06-30,25316453,Morgan,Everything was exactly as is shown in the pics.  We had a good stay at Seif's place.  We liked the location.
10995976,83138385,2016-07-01,32946113,John,"Seif's place was affordable , easy to find, and most importantly clean. We had brand new sheets waiting for us, as well as access to towels, an ironing board ( and iron), and toiletries. Seif was very easy to get a hold of via e-mail and phone. My buddy forgot our room number ( at 1:00am!) he simply gave her a call and she directed him. If you're looking to visit the Boston, I'd highly recommend staying at Seif's."
10995976,83327327,2016-07-02,80134585,Nadine,Seif was nice and accommodating. We had everything we needed and they are a 5 minute walk from the Fenway area!
10995976,83675598,2016-07-03,25413675,Richard,"The room is fine - good value. The location is great, and Seif and his roommate made us feel welcome. Thanks Seif!"
10995976,90284117,2016-07-31,59378937,Ibrahim,"This was my first experience in the US. I was a bit nervous about my trip to a relative unknown place for me. However Abubakr (cousin of Seif) was so kind to pick me up at the airport and he made me feel very comfortable. The room was quite comfortable. Because of the hot weather Abubakr fixed an AC in a relative short period, which I appreciate. Abubakr provided some soda's and candys during our stay."
The place is very close to Fenway,downtown with great spots (Prudentials,"convention center) and the Longwood Medical area. I had to join classes at Harvard school of public health and it was just 15 minutes walking distance. Overall perfect place for a great price ! \"",,,
10995976,90901137,2016-08-02,40716354,René,"Seif was very polite and concerned about us. The apartment was alright, but unfortunately not as clean as we expected."
10995976,91031952,2016-08-03,80561570,Marlene,"If the highest rating you could give someone was 5 stars, I would want to give Seif 10.  I was supposed to arrive at around 2:30, but I overshot Boston and ended up in Quincy.  Seif waited around for me to find my way back.  Then, while we were on the phone, I drove right by him talking to me outside! Because of one-way streets and traffic, it took 15-20 minutes for me to get back to his street.  I wouldn't have blamed him if he had just thrown the keys at me and said the room is on the 3rd floor, have a nice stay. But while I waited in the car, he walked my daughter up to the apartment.  Then he had me follow him in his car to find parking.  And he found a great spot.  It was like he pulled it out of thin air and it was perfect.  Then he made sure I knew how to get from the car to the apartment and would remember where there car was.  Then he told me how to get home later in the evening after going out and recommended Fasten and gave me a code to get a discount.  *Then* he said goodbye!  The man is a saint.  We went from his place to McGreevy's on Boylston St and The Royale theater on Tremont for a concert which got out late.  We were walking the streets at midnight.  Everything was walkable either directly or to a T stop, and safe.  People around Boston were friendly.  The location was ideal.  Seif is super nice and has a beautiful warm smile.  He is definitely in the right business.  This was my first airbnb reservation (not my first stay; I was in Portland ME the Saturday before) and the experience has sold me on the whole process.  I'm sorry this is long but I have so many great things to say.  Thank you Seif!  I will be back and will have better maps and apps next time!"
10995976,91349280,2016-08-05,46495751,Barbara,"If you're looking for a reasonably comfortable place to stay in a great location at an affordable price and with a kind, attentive host ... this place is for you! Seif made sure we had a smooth arrival and did everything possible to make sure we had a great time in Boston."
"The only downside was that the kitchen and bathroom were not as clean as I would expect... but that wouldn't keep me from staying there again.\"",,,,,
10995976,92478853,2016-08-08,58506724,Anthony,"This is a location that is 100% a location value, it is a small and shared with other airbnb guests. The place could be cleaned better, as the bathroom lights would flicker and bathroom was dirty. The bedroom was cluttered and dusty but to be honest the price of the space and the host were really good. The host came 15 mintues after I called to give me keys to the place. He is a nice man and did try to accommodate anything I needed. Overall it was a great experience it just needs to be cleaned."
10995976,92664088,2016-08-09,52824833,Bruce,Seif was totally friendly and accommodating.  We met up easily on our arrival and he even found us a street parking spot that was free for the entire 30 hours we were in town.  The room was exactly as described and had everything we needed for a brief stay.
10995976,93921228,2016-08-14,75370309,Kevin,"Excellent location, great price, responsible host! I would stay there again."

10995976,96806634,2016-08-24,73225406,Tim,"This was my first time in Boston. I had difficulty finding my way around at first, and especially finding parking. Mohab was very helpful in this regard, and also helped bring my stuff up to the room. The space had everything I needed, though the bathroom and kitchen could be kept up a little better. Overall, I had a great time."
10995976,98170496,2016-08-29,3103496,Shanna,"The host was available to welcome us into the building and show us the space. Although he didn't stick around to introduce us to the city, we were okay with that. The location is perfect - it's in an area of town that is close to just about everything and there's plenty of food/entertainment in the immediate walking area. The room itself was fairly clean and the bed linens and sheets were fresh. Window A/C made it easy to control the temp in our space. Unfortunately, the common areas were a bit dirty and there are no locks on the bedroom/bathroom door.  Other than that, we did enjoy our stay."
10995976,98442101,2016-08-31,82292995,María Laura,"La habitación es pequeña y cómoda como para pasar una o dos noches. La zona es buena y cerca de la mayoría de los lugares para visitar. No funcionó el WiFi en mi estadía y en general la limpieza era pobre, con polvo por todos lados y toallas viejas. Esperamos treinta minutos en la puerta para entrar y el anfitrión cuando llegamos sólo estuvo dos minutos y nunca pudo solucionar el problema del WiFi."

I would suggest getting a parking deal at the local parking garage because the rates fluctuate during the ball games. 24hr super market across the street was a plus. Thanks again.

14351036,93579048,2016-08-13,87608692,Kenton,"Jack was a nice guy and accommodating when I showed up much later than expected. The location is good but the apartment itself is filthy. There were stains on the walls/carpets, mold growing in the bathroom, overwhelming clutter in the bathroom and a very strong lingering odor. I'm not sure if the AC stopped working one night, but my room got so hot I couldn't fall asleep. I guess you get what you pay for. If you can get past these annoyances, it's a great buy!"
14351036,95380737,2016-08-19,30673194,Harshil,"Jack was very accommodating and polite. He was generally very prompt with responses to any questions. As he mentioned, this is a very minimalistic arrangement, which is what I gladly signed up for. Very good location for accessibility to many places. However, the a/c sometimes stopped working at night (making it hard to sleep) and the actual apartment and room/bathroom isn't particularly clean. There is also a lingering odor which was very unpleasant at first, but I got used to it. Despite this, the place is overall a fair value given its location and Jack is very accommodating."
14351036,95712077,2016-08-20,81172022,Yaryna,Host met us very welcome. The location is good. But only thing is that the room smells bad
14351036,97234399,2016-08-26,29472266,Tong,"Jack was really respectful of my privacy and I like that he took a very hands off approach to managing his guest, I value my privacy as a person and I really appreciate that aspect of it during my stay."

1498719,7655398,2013-09-28,8729420,Ashley,Great place to stay and great location. It was very clean and well maintained. Very close to the Copley station. I was out there for a week and I would definitely stay there again if I go back to Boston. Randy was also very responsive. I was a little skeptical to book a place that had no reviews but I took the chance it was a very positive experience.

1498719,7852046,2013-10-06,8303913,Bettina,Beautiful and cozy apartment in the perfect spot to discover Boston! Randy is a caring hoast and the place was very clean! We highly recommend this place!
1498719,8026441,2013-10-13,1349465,Mark,Pros:
-- Awesome location.,,,,,
-- Nice,stylish place.  Spacious for a studio.,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
--- Loud in the mornings because the bed is right next to the building's back exit that some people use. (It was quiet during the night though because it faces a parking area and not the street).,,,,,
-- The bed was comfy for one person but it's tucked into a nook so if there were two people,one would need to climb over the other or get out from the part of the bed where their feet are.  Also,there was no nightstand which was fine since it was just me and I used the other side of the bed as my nightstand.,,,
-- The heater is right by the bed.  I imagine when it becomes cold and it turns on automatically,"could get quite hot.  \"",,,,
1498719,8254289,2013-10-22,8573121,Amy,"My sister and I spent this past weekend in Boston and had a great time!  We wanted to be somewhere close to great shopping, good restaurants, and close enough to public transportation that we wouldn't have to rely on taxis.  Randy's place was perfect!    It's located on a very cute street in a beautiful neighborhood and literally a 5 minute walk to great shopping and (URL HIDDEN) more block and you're at the T station which will take you anywhere you want to go.  Randy also recommended two restaurants that we eat at and we took his advice - we were not disappointed!  Joe's Bar and Grill on Newbury Street is a must if you stay in Back Bay.  Randy communicated promptly and often throughout our stay to make sure we were doing well.  I highly recommend his place!"
1498719,80579300,2016-06-19,53742275,Bob,"This place was PERFECT for what we were looking for!  The location was so phenomenal, beautiful street, walking distance to so many great shops/restaurants, fenway, freedom trail landmarks!  Randy was great before, during and after our stay.  We were new to Boston and he gave us great tips on how to get to his place, how to use the public transportation, places to eat and visit, sights to see etc.  Really appreciated Randy's wonderful communication, he made checking in and out very easy!  My wife is a clean FREAK (borderline o.c.d.) and the studio even met/exceeded her standards.   The studio was so cute, very well decorated, extremely clean and laid out great!  Oh yeah, and the neighborhood is very safe....each night we walked home  late and never felt uneasy at all.  I'd highly recommend it.  Great experience and an awesome host.  Thanks Randy!"
1498719,81956911,2016-06-26,69291488,Richard,"I stayed for three nights at Randy's garden level studio.  Prior to my stay, Randy was very helpful in explaining the check-in procedure via the lockbox and describing the amenities within the studio.  I found the accommodations to be quite stylish, clean and very comfortable.  I would not hesitate in staying at this location in the future."

1498719,87679980,2016-07-21,31882061,Cory,Best neighborhood to stay in in Boston. Close to great shopping and in a very clean and safe neighborhood. A quick transit ride to downtown but out of the chaos of tourist. Felt like we were apart of the city.
1498719,89036197,2016-07-26,9797036,Lynette,"Randy's home was in an excellent location to launch our Boston trip. Back Bay is a very nice, safe neighborhood and Randy's home is in walking distance to many good restaurants, shopping and public transportation. We also liked walking along the Esplanade at sunset. (Although all of the Boston runners down there made me feel a bit like a slacker) We walked, used public transportation and Uber to navigate the city without a rental car. The photos are not misleading. Randy's home is beautiful and comfortable. The bed and couch were extra comfy. The air conditioner provided good white noise and we rarely heard the neighbors. Good wifi and television were a bonus that we missed during previous Airbnb experiences. Overall, I would highly recommend this home for your next Boston stay."
1498719,89848119,2016-07-30,84108812,John,"Randy's place was everything as promised. Very neat and clean.

The unit was very clean and was as described. It is a lower garden unit and was very quiet. It is a large studio unit so perfect for two people. Beautifully decorated. Kitchen is small but comes equipped with all that is needed. While we ate out each night,we did eat breakfast in the unit each morning. To come back to the unit after a day of sightseeing and shopping was stepping into an oasis of peace and quiet.,,,,
The bed was really comfortable. While the space the bed in is tight,it did not cause us any concerns.,,,,
Another wonderful feature,which I have not always experienced in other airbnb's we have used,was the luxury towels. A nice touch!,,,
Randy was quick to reply to emails and left us extensive details of what to do and see in the area -  restaurants,running trails,coffee shops,shopping etc.,,
Big screen tv for those who want to watch tv and the wifi was super.,,,,,
I would definitely stay here again and I will be recommending it to fellow friends.,,,,,

The restaurants and shops of vibrant Centre Street are right outside the door and you're a short walk to the train at Stony Brook.

The space itself is very centrally located to some great restaurants,parks and public transportation.

4149974,35957530,2015-06-23,34953409,Kate,The location was great and everything in the listing was accurate. Though I did not get to meet the hosts I felt very welcome and there was clear contact throughout the experience. The apartment is lovely and we really enjoyed our stay.
4149974,36807781,2015-07-01,17658818,Jeff,"Joe greeted me in person. The space is unusual in that is appears to be fashioned out of the back stairs, hallway and porch of what used to be a duplex (two family as they call them in Boston). At first I felt a little exposed having the back door of what must be a condo unit and the back stairway of an upstairs unit right there in the space, but I never saw anyone enter the AirBnB space, so I got accustomed to it.  They left a couple of bananas for me, which I thought was nice. The location is very convenient. The windows are well insulated and block out most of the noise from Centre St. The space was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The space is very much like a hotel room. There is a small refrigerator, coffee maker and that's it."
4149974,37166761,2015-07-05,30070254,Rachael,Centered on Centre was absolutely lovely. Great location in JP--nearby amenities within walking distance. The space was welcoming and clean. It was all around a great experience with a very communicative host.
4149974,38259473,2015-07-14,10160615,Meghan,"We had a great time at Joe's space and in Boston. It was super clean, had all the amenities anyone would need (and he brought an iron and board for me to use as well!), and the location was perfect. Right in the middle of Jamaica Plain, with the orange line nearby and the 39 bus outside the door. Joe was very communicative and responsive, but we also had total privacy. We would absolutely book his spot again if we had the opportunity. Thank you."
4149974,39171441,2015-07-21,34303551,Nancy,"Thoroughly enjoyed staying at Centered on Centre. Unfortunately between their schedules and mine, I never did get a chance to meet Joe or Ayad. However, they did make me feel welcome with several texts. The place was very, very nice and was located in JP just where I wanted it. The place is just as its pictured.  Would definitely recommend this place for one or two people. Close to the T and bus stop."
4149974,39755905,2015-07-26,33317914,Deb,We had instructions before we needed them which was very helpful. The space is tucked away and was very quiet. Quiet music and a few welcome items greeted us. What fun!
4149974,40450788,2015-07-31,1216422,Alex,"Great host, super responsive and flexible with us. The place was perfect for the two of us and near a lot of great places in Jamaica Plain. If this is the area you want to stay, it couldn't be better."
4149974,40928858,2015-08-03,13869000,Carley,Joe/Ayad were excellent hosts! The place is exactly as described and was very clean and comfortable. The added touches they provided were greatly appreciated (i.e. chocolates on pillows and cold beverages in the refrigerator!). I would definitely recommend this spot to other travelers. Thanks to both of you for the great stay!
4149974,43351696,2015-08-19,15933074,Massimiliano,"Abbiamo soggiornato a casa di Joe e Ayad purtroppo solo per tre notti. La casa rispecchia fedelmente la descrizione dell'annuncio e si trova in un quartiere molto molto bello. Ayad ci ha accolto con cortesia mostrandoci la casa e presentandoci le regole della buona convivenza (tradotte anche in italiano). Ci ha fatto notare che le stanze sono vicine ad altri due appartamenti e quindi si percepiscono i rumori delle rispettive cucine, che a noi non hanno dato alcun fastidio. La casa ci è stata consegnata pulita, profumata e con asciugamani morbidissimi. Piacevole l'accoglienza con due cioccolatini sul letto ed un frigorifero fornito di acqua fresca. La casa si trova vicinissima ad alcuni ristoranti etnici, supermercati e farmacia. A poca distanza da un lago molto pittoresco intorno al quale si può correre. La stazione della metropolitana Linea Orange è a 8/10 minuti a piedi dalla casa e porta direttamente in centro in 15 minuti. Il quartiere è tranquillo e sicuro. Se dovessimo tornare a Boston, sicuramente contatteremmo di nuovo Joe e Ayad per stare da loro. GRAZIE!"
4149974,43885716,2015-08-22,20974243,Vanessa,"House was as described, in a very nice neighbourhood. It's a 10 min Walk to the Orange line Subway and then it takes only 10-15 min to get downtown Boston. A printed neighbourhood Guide was provided and also Shampoo, Coffee and a Few Drinks. Joe was a very helpful host."

Centered on Centre is perfectly located near a metro line, Whole Foods, and amazing restaurants (Tres Gatos is a must-eat!).  They were incredibly considerate - they provided us with coffee, mini-chocolates, and the like.  I would move there in a heartbeat!  The place is cute and cozy.  Thanks again, guys!"
4149974,46495021,2015-09-11,39966094,Nicole,"Great experience. Apartment was clean, comfortable and private. Located in a seemingly quiet and safe neighbourhood. Joe and Ayad were very accommodating with our check in and check out times which was a huge help. We didn't get to meet them in person but felt very welcome after being greeted by a note, chocolates and a couple of cold waters left in the fridge. We were very grateful for the air conditioning unit considering how hot and humid it was our first day in. Located a bit far from the main sights in Boston but public transit is very accessible and easy to navigate. Thank you for letting us into your home!"
4149974,46871286,2015-09-14,35361896,Jay,Perfect host! Very friendly and helpful. Great neighborhood with lots of Restaurants and Bars and an easy connection with subway and bus to Boston Downtown. Rooms were very clean and comfortable! 100% recommended if you are looking for a great place to stay in Boston :)
"Thank you very much for having us!\"",,,,,
4149974,48519439,2015-09-27,2781023,Heather,"Our host was very welcoming and made himself available to help us out, hand off the key, and even provide a can opener. :) The location and apartment were just as described. The apartment was extremely clean and well kept and very recently renovated. If you're looking for a great, super convenient spot to explore Jamaica Plain - this is it. The location was great - we could walk out the door and get coffee or grab lunch or go shopping etc. The apartment is essentially an efficiency unit so it's not a place you should plan to spend hours indoors but it does the job. It's clean and cute. The owners are lovely and the location is great. Plus it's affordable."
4149974,49100950,2015-10-01,35489383,Christoph,"Joe hat uns sehr herzlich empfangen und uns gleich alles erklärt, was es zu wissen gab. Die Wohnung war sehr schön aufgeräumt und wie auf den Bildern. Es standen Getränke bereit und ein Blatt mit den wichtigsten Infos. Die Nachbarschaft ist sympathisch, es gibt alles was man braucht, ein Bus hält direkt vor der Haustür, die Metro ist ebenfalls zu Fuß gut zu erreichen. In der Stadt ist man auch recht schnell."
"Wir haben uns in der Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt und eine tolle Zeit in Boston verbracht. Die Unterkunft ist definitiv zu empfehlen.\"",,,,,

The location was super easy to find from the center of Jamaica Plain,all kind of business were just only a few minutes walking distance,Seven Eleven is right across the street.,,,
MBTA bus stop is right in front of the building. Subway station is in 10 mins walking distance.,,,,,
Since it was a self check In/Out style room,I didn't have a chance to meet both Joe & Ayad,but Joe was super kind on every messaging and he responds right away for all texts.,,,
He was just an amazing host!!,,,,,
This place is highly recommended!!,,,,,

4149974,53108203,2015-11-05,40256377,Richard,"Host was really friendly, kept in touch and nothing was too much trouble. The apartment was spotless, towels super fluffy and bed very comfortable. Great location for the subway and local bars etc. Worth a stay!"
4149974,53488294,2015-11-09,10786111,Britney,This apartment was amazing! Great location with restaurants near by and a lovely walk to the T train. It was beautifully decorated and the bed was extra confortable. The host were especially accomadating and allowed me to arrive early. They even went the extra mile and had goodies and coffee in the apartment. I highly recommend staying there! It was great Boston experience.
4149974,58072970,2015-12-31,1369577,Thomas & Gaby,The apartment looks just as pictured.
4149974,58734157,2016-01-03,52686098,Cody,"We found Joe & Ayad's place when booking a last minute weekend trip to Boston. Being around the holidays we were very fortunate to have found such a beautiful, affordable and conveniently located place to stay.  The bedroom, entry and bathroom were clean and comfortable. Having a private entrance was a great bonus that really made this space stand out. Parking was not difficult and the home is within walking distance of a pharmacy and supermarket. We didn't have a chance to eat at the tapas restaurant next door but it had great reviews. Joe and Ayad went above and beyond by offering us an early check in and late checkout. Great hosts, great space. No isssues at all. :-)"
4149974,62156724,2016-02-12,38073073,Vanessa,"Thank you so much!! I felt very welcome. The studio's description is accurate, very cozy, clean and great location. The hosts were very polite,  helpful and easy to reach. It was the perfect place for me, and I will for sure visit again. It absolutely met my expectations :-) and I would totally recommend this studio to everyone visiting beautiful Boston."
"\"",,,,,
4149974,64590656,2016-03-06,35027730,Rosalina,Everything about the apartment was as listed. The location was extremely convenient as there was a bus stop right outside the door. I was happy to find the Whole Foods and Cuban restaurant a few blocks down. Would recommend and stay again.
4149974,66025530,2016-03-19,46286575,Stefanie,"Obwohl wir Joe nicht persönlich getroffen haben, fühlten wir uns immer umsorgt."
Die Wohnung ist zwar klein,aber für zwei Personen genau richtig. Ein winziger Kritikpunkt wäre,dass es nur einen kleinen Spiegel im Bad gibt,was bei zwei Mädels etwas problematisch ist. Im Flur oder Schlafzimmer ist sicherlich noch Platz für einen weiteren. Ansonsten war alles perfekt.,,
"\"",,,,,
4149974,67136586,2016-03-27,19935022,Jenny,Joe met me in front of the Airbnb and showed me around. He gave me local recs for food and had already prepared a list of local places and instructions for the space that were easily accessible.
"The listing looked just as I had imagined and was very very clean. It was a total joy to stay here and it was perfectly located for exploring Jamaica Plain and the rest of Boston. \"",,,,,
4149974,68673295,2016-04-06,47200576,Corina,The apartement was very clean and had basically everything you need. It is a bit small for two people but sufficient for a few days.
Joe was very kind. He asked several times if we need something else and responded all questions within minutes.,,,,,
Inside the apartement are two doors leading to the neighbours. According to the host they are only for a fire emergency and stand under alarm. But at least one of them isn't because one evening the neighbours children made a game out of it to open the door and came down to our apartement. But you can lock the bedroom door if you're worried about someone coming in.,,,,,
The apartement is located in a quiet neighbourhood with different restaurants around. The next bus stop to get into the city is right in front of the door and you can reach the subway after a short walk.,,,,,
"We would stay here again!\"",,,,,
4149974,69170105,2016-04-09,20308462,Peg,"Lusting was exactly as described. Very private, cozy space. Perfect location for easy access to city!  Would definitely return!"
4149974,69843656,2016-04-14,5137823,Anne,Terrific location and wonderful hosts.  I booked this on behalf of an out of town colleague and all the arrangements went very smoothly. Thank you Joe and Ayad!
4149974,70731383,2016-04-20,13101751,Dirk,It's a nice little space - with 2 very friendly hosts. JP itself is a nice neighbourhood and you have easy access to downtown by bus or train. Joe & Ayad will make you feel welcome - and they are very helpful. So we had a perfect stay there and I could concentrate on preparing for the marathon.
"We would definitely recommend this place!\"",,,,,
4149974,71125601,2016-04-23,37907350,June,"Excellent stay! See the cozy entry way with two chairs? On our first night, seeing many nights ahead of dining out, we bought a bottle of wine at the corner wine store, some carry out from nearby Whole Foods and Joe came right over with wine glasses! (I would have used the coffee mugs.) Great hosts, great location. CLEAN and comfortable. Thanks so much Joe & Ayad for also letting us delay our departure a bit. Took the bus right there to Back Bay Station to catch our train ride to NYC. Super great vacation that started here!"
4149974,71926694,2016-04-29,5970646,Nessa,"This was a perfect Studio for my work trip. It's a five minute walk to the T And a quick trip downtown. Great location on Centre St, with plenty of great eating, beverage, and grocery options steps away. The rooms are very clean, and it was great to be able to start my day with coffee."
4149974,72441913,2016-05-02,60113271,Aaron,"great spot, location, and host. would come again!"
4149974,75589069,2016-05-22,55715729,Aleksey,This was a great experience in my part. I received exactly what I expected:
- clean place with a fridge,bed,personal bathroom and shower,my own access to door.,,
- again,places was clean ( I am a clean freak),,,,
- apartment located right on bus lines and very close to the T( metro) very comfortable if using public transport!,,,,,
- host was very responsive and cooperative to any of my requests,typically with in few hours.,,,,
If I am ever in Boston,I want to come back.,,,,
Wait,price is great! Any hotel in this proximity to center of Boston runs 250$ a night!  Also  location has restaurants right by it and basic convenience store,( those that like to run,Jamaica Pond two blocks away is amazing for morning jogs),,

4149974,77555163,2016-06-01,12768445,John,"Joe was super helpful during our entire stay, dropping down an iron and board to the apartment when I needed it and letting me stay beyond the check-out time as I had a later flight."
The listing was exactly as described/depicted. The apartment is ideal if you just want a place to sleep/shower/store food. Given the great restaurants literally on your door step,I would advise guests to get out and sample the great food Boston has to offer.,,,,
One tip: If you're getting an Uber,make sure you specify that the apartment is in Jamaica Plain,or quote the ZIP code - otherwise,like my party,"you could end up in the wrong end of town! (Not as bad as it sounds). Boston seems to reuse street names with wild abandon. :) \"",
4149974,77965606,2016-06-04,37267811,Sue,Thank you for hosting us at your very nice apartment in the Boston area. It was just as pictured and described and very clean! It is just a short walk to the public transportation and served our needs well.

It's exactly as described - a room, a private bathroom, and a foyer with a nice small table and 2 chairs. The wireless was fast. There was a small fridge with a few drinks inside, coffee was available as well. The neighborhood was so sweet - within walking distance was a CVS and a Whole Foods, as well as a number of restaurants including an incredible Tapa's bar. Would highly recommend."
4149974,81065715,2016-06-20,61546053,Pedro,"Joe was an excellent host, very kind and attentive. We had a disagreement as to the wrong address published by AIRBNB and he guided us how to get the correct address. Unlike other times, in which I stay in hotels this is the first time that I use this hosting system and my perception was great. The apt is simple but sufficient and very well located in a neighborhood with access to metro (10 minutes walk) and buses in front of the house. The neighborhood is very interesting and full of bars and restaurants. So you know the tourist Boston during the day and the real Boston night. Thank you Joe."

182049,416198,2011-08-02,754314,Patricia,Brahma was extremely helpful throughout our stay in Herbivorian House. The apartment is quite large for a two bedroomed space and the balcony has amazing views of the city. Just a 10-15 min walk to the blue line airport T stop and weekly ticket costs just 15 dollars. As the apartment is on the third floor it may not be suitable for the elderly.
182049,491672,2011-08-31,472317,Rodney And Emily,We really enjoyed our stay at the herbivorian house. A basic
layout with all we needed to be home bound during hurricane irene.The house has wonderful old character and the neighbourhood was fun to explore and convenient to the train to downtown. The view from the balcony was magnificent for such a well priced place,"and we would recomend it to anyone.\"",,,,
182049,664028,2011-10-25,1222982,Evan,"Brahma was a great host during our stay. He's more than willing to share details about the area and get you whatever you might need to make your stay more comfortable. The Skyrama apartment is fairly barre bones but has everything you'd need for a multi-night stay. And the view from the porch, perched at the top of Eagle Hill, is stunning."
182049,1532729,2012-06-21,419396,Conrad,"We ended up needing a place to stay at the last minute and with two large conferences in town we struggled trying to find anywhere to stay. We lucked out finding Brahma and the SkyRama at the very last minute but everything worked out great. Brahma was very accommodating to our late arrival and hectic schedule. The unit was perfect for our short stay, and has a great overall vibe. Waking up to the downtown skyline was a nice perk :)"
"It's just outside of downtown Boston but getting to and from the city was very easy with public transportation. Would certainly stay here again if I needed a place. \"",,,,,
182049,1932331,2012-08-09,2433601,Markus,We spent 6 days in the Herbivorian House and had an overall great stay. The apartment is comfortable and has a lot of space. Brahma is very helpful and can give valuable suggestions for excursions.
182049,2059755,2012-08-21,531584,Carlos,"Place was great! Originally meant to stay in third floor apartment but was upgraded to the second floor apartment due to renovations. Awesome apartment, plenty of space and very airy. Walk to the station was bearable, could sometimes be a pain but the view from the balcony is fantastic. Big grocery store is also a fair walk. Brahma was extremely helpful and was very responsive to our needs. Only downside to our stay was that the water had shut off overnight, but this was rectified by Brahma in the morning very quickly. Shower pressure was very, very poor and internet connection was rather slow, but functional. Other than that, the place was great! Would definitely stay here again!"
182049,2516731,2012-10-05,3383792,Elle,"We stayed in the Lotus Apartment and it felt very luxurious after our scuzzy NYC apartment. Beautiful space, roomy with comfy beds and great amenities. Plenty of little supermarkets nearby, a couple of restaurants, although not really a foodie area. About a 10 min walk to the large supermarket and nearest train station. Very quick train ride into the city."
"Brahma was very welcoming and had plenty of tips for us and a selection of maps. There's even a jacuzzi!\"",,,,,
182049,2563375,2012-10-09,2032194,Gwen,"We spent 3 days in Herbivoran House SkyRama.  The apartment is clean, and functional but still in renovation. The fridge is a little noisy. Communications with Brahma & Zhenya are easy. Late check-in/Check-out were simple."

182049,2800637,2012-11-04,3570742,Roberto,"What a great place for a first AirBnB experience!! Brahma is really kind and mellow and even a paranoid tightly-wound guy like me can start feeling relaxed right away. He shows you the apartment and where it is on a  map he has ready for you, tells you about Boston and answers whatever questions you may  have. He is a herbivorian and it shows, no agression radiating off of him whatsoever, I'll tell you."
"Also I ordered a bunch of stuff from Amazon and some of it arrived ahead of me...\"\"No problem\"\"",said Brahma with a smile (I just imagined the smile; we were emailing,but anyway),,,
Another thing,I originally booked Skyrama but was upgraded to Lotus on the second floor because of renovations. Lotus has very nice wood floors,a shiny new kitchen and just an overall stylish feel to it. The fridge is huge,the shower works,so do the smoke alarms (sorry about that Brahma),and it has a flatscreen 32' with HDMI and USB ports. Ok
What else? Oh,squirrels!!!! Every morning,right behind the house.,,,
Also from behind the house,a nice view of Boston.,,,,
Hurricane Sandy came just around my second week here,but the house offered a nice sense of comfort and safety.,,,,
So would I recommend Herbivorian House? YEAH!! A hundred times over. And I'm a meat-eater,so imagine.,,,,
Oh and Brahma lent me an clothes iron. Even ironing is relaxing here.,,,,,
Only one little thing: Sound carries at these old buildings with lots of wood. So if you are a light sleeper bring some earplugs.,,,,,

Brahma was both friendly and extremely helpful, and everything from the booking all the way through the check out went without a hitch. Highly recommended!"
182049,3979764,2013-04-01,5091431,Paul,Hi folks:
Stayed with Brahma for a month as I was trying to situate myself in Boston. I initially rented lotus from them and they upgraded me to Herbivorean which was a very nice surprise. Although I was working a lot and still have not been able to sight see much,I found the apartment to be very comfortable - a great place to recharge after a long day of work.,,,,
Brahma is a very friendly host,who is more than willing to offer help and advice should you require it. I enjoyed my stay immensely and would definitely stay with Brahma again given the opportunity.,,,,

Although Brahma was out of town he made every effort to make sure that we had everything we needed. He even called us from Switzerland in order to give us a phone tour of the apartment. The space itself is light, airy, and comfortable. Plus, the apartment is conveniently located near the airport and doesn't take too long to get into Boston proper. I highly recommend staying at the Lotus and will certainly stay here again should the need arise!"

182049,20859680,2014-10-06,16770954,Zenia,"Brahma was such a life saver! I had a different booking, which was cancelled due to personal reason of the owner, and fairly soon before my arrival in Boston. I was a bit stressed because I was in the midst of some exams and didn't have much time to spend searching for another place but I found Brahma's wonderful places. He accepted me promptly and I was at ease again! I believe everything happens for a reason, and I was even happier that I got the chance to stay at the Herbivorian SkyRama! It's so cozy and fun. The decor was beautiful and crafty. The place was very clean and welcoming, and well equipped. Brahma was very kind and friendly. He welcomed me, helped carry my luggage up, and gave me a tour and instructions about getting around and and showed me on maps where the corner stores were and such. Also getting into the city was quick and no trouble at all."
"My favourite thing was hearing the birds sing in the morning. Their chirp was less of a bothersome sound and more of a melody. It was so lovely to listen to and I found it to be quite soothing. No complaints and I absolutely recommend staying with Brahma!! Thanks again so much I had a great time. :) \"",,,,,
182049,21755682,2014-10-23,21210888,Paul,Brahma was a terrific and flexible host. The apartment was as described with a great view of the city skyline. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen well equipped.

182049,30388039,2015-04-21,28226714,Mark,Brahma was very welcoming and is a good communicator.  The listing was as advertised.  The view is amazing.  This is a great place for 4 people to stay easily.  We walked to and from the Airport T spot and thought the neighbor was fine.  Would stay again.  Strongly recommended.

We couldn't have asked for a better host than Mike /Susie.. Our first time in Boston. We were a party of 3. Only took about an hour to approve our request. First of all,they allowed us to drop off our bags early since we arrived at 6am. First impression of the host,very warm and gracious . The room was  Super clean,neat and nicely decorated,looks better than the pictures. Oh,we slept like babies. Mike offered breakfast
14168664,91941893,2016-08-07,9830598,Lara And Jay,"My brother and I stayed at Susie and Mike's apartment for one night. It was great. Very clean, comfortable bed, steps from the T, about 15 minutes from downtown. Mike and Susie were not home but we're very informative and Responsove. I would definitely stay here again."
14168664,92384108,2016-08-08,45373657,Inna,"Susie and Mike were VERY easy to communicate with, prompt in their replies and super friendly! They even had Popsicles and ice cream for our kids!"
Their apartment is a second floor walk up,easy to find,and immaculate. We came on a hot weekend and they had our room cooled down nicely with a window unit which was very thoughtful especially since most Bostonians do not need/have AC. The room closet is VERY big and totally empty for our use. The bed was,I believe,brand new with a firm and very comfortable mattress. Trundle bed was perfect for our kids and easy to use. Plenty of lighting. Decor was thoughtful,classy and (again) immaculate! Being right next to the airport
Bathroom was immaculately clean with fresh towels and a new sink/vanity.,,,,,
We didn't use the galley kitchen much but it appeared to be newly renovated with attractive tile and a modern design.,,,,,
We very much enjoyed our dinner in the neighborhood which was at a Peruvian restaurant,Rincon Limeno. We highly recommend it!!,,,,
Overall a perfect place for us to stay overnight with our two kids the night before our 6am flight out of Logan.,,,,,

We were gone for most of the day everyday so we really just needed somewhere to sleep and shower. It is located in a good neighborhood. There was free parking on the street which was great. There were towels, shampoo, soap, conditioner, toothpaste all there in case we forgot. The shower is small, but it works. If we had any problems we just texted and they were right there. You don't get a ton of phone service in the basement, but there is WiFi. The location was great for us because we had a car so everything was about 20 minutes away."
6006328,68518452,2016-04-05,11234745,Katherine,"Eric (and his parents) were great hosts - his parents live in the flat above, and were really friendly and welcoming. The flat was cosy and comfortable (bigger than it looks in the photos) in a quiet neighbourhood - 5 minutes walk to shops and the 31 bus stop, which took about 10 minutes to get to Forest Hills T stop (orange line). The flat had everything we needed - hot shower, fridge and freezer, oven and microwave, TV. Eric senior in particular was so friendly and helpful - always happy to chat to my dad about cricket, he brought us a landline down on the second day, and even gave us a lift into the city for my conference paper, and then to the airport on the last day. This was a great value rental, from a really friendly family who were really eager to help. We felt like really welcome guests - thank you so much!"

Short Walk to The bus which takes you to The T, then you can go anywhere. Tip: if you are tall, you may hit your head on the ceiling. It is a basement so the ceiling is low. But was not a big deal. Would definitely come back!!!"

The apartment is really clean and contains all the possible utilities. The two bedrooms are ideal and very comfortable. Eric was kind enough to provide us with a crate of drinking water, mints, coffee/tea, all toiletries. We even used the washer and dryer which was great considering we had to stay for 9 days. We were so relaxed that we really did not need anything else. The apartment is a complete package with everything one could ask for. Parking outside the apartment was never a problem since we drove up from New Jersey. Thank you Eric Jr and Sr for accommodating us and being so welcoming. We will definitely come back again whenever we visit Boston."

The appartement is located at ~50 min from Boston downtown by a sequence bus - train. The appartement was as shown on pictures : low ceiling and small windows because it is in the basement. The toilet was in a small place and it was impossible to stand for 1m75 tall people. The neighborhood was noisy until late in the night during our 5 nights stay, probably because of the 4th of July national celebration."

We booked the apartment for 2 weeks and checked out after 5 days.  The neighborhood was bad and the apartment was filthy.   We spent 2-3 hours cleaning the kitchen in an effort to cook and feel comfortable.  There were spiders and spider webs that we saw on a regular basis.  A tree fell in the neigbors yard over their garage (out of their control).  When the company showed up to clear the tree I texted Eric....he told be to call his mother.  NOT MY JOB!!!   I contacted Eric to explain why we checked out and he said I should have said something the day we checked in.  As I mentioned previously we were in Boston for a medical procedure and my priority was on my son and not contacting him about the apartment.  His response was, \"\"This is not a fair response\"\".  I will never return nor do I have anything good to say about our experience with Eric or his apartment. \""

The fact that Whole Foods was just down the block made it easy to stock the refrigerator and gather with family in a home-like setting. The local manager Peter was very responsive to questions we had prior to our visit, and the amenities of the building (a gym, outdoor space) was an added plus. We will definitely stay here again."

I mean everywhere! It has cost me $300 to dry clean all my business suits and leisure clothing, they offered me a $100 coupon for flat book, which is a typical method to try and retain a client without compensating them the fair way, on top of this there was female hair all over the towels, I would avoid this company, they have a great customer service until something is not right, I have all emails to prove my experiences alongside photographs! Avoid this company there are so many others, I mean how can you rent a dirty apartment!?! And charge what they do"

I realize you may not do a lot of grocery shopping while you are there, but go check out all of the meals you can order. The staff was very helpful. They even changed out our mattress when we reported that the middle of it was completely sunken in. Granted the mattresses they use are really cheap, but it was nice that they solved our issue.

To access downtown Boston or to the nearest T train, was ~ 10 minute walk however the location was handy to the newly gentrified South Boston area with some great little cafes and markets, and of course whole foods.

I didn't need to meet anyone of Flat book team because they send me an email to check in,so that was comfortable to me.,,,,
Ink block building was so nice and doorman was very kind.,,,,,

The building was modern and well-maintained and the unit itself was spotless.  We appreciated having Whole Foods next door for supplies.  Also enjoying access to a pool and gym, and the location was within walking distance of the T.  Flatbook did an excellent job of coordinating booking and check-in.  My only (small) complaint was that the listing description indicated \"\"wide open views of the downtown skyline\"\""
Thanks,"Flatbook!  \"",,,,

Métro à 10 mn à pieds et gare routière à 15mn. Whole food market pour préserver sa santé juste à côté. Supermarché chinois à 100m.  Juste une petite remarque pratique, nous aurions aimé pouvoir déposer les bagages dans un local avant le check-in et après le check-out. Sinon très bonne adresse à recommander."

Many places to eat within walking distance and it was easy to get and uber to the rest of the city. Being above a Whole Foods was convenient. We were also within walking distance to a CVS for other needs. We highly recommend this listing and will consider booking again in the future."

There were no photos as it was a very new listing at the time but I'd looked at his other places and reviews and was sure we would be happy with the place... and we were. Newly furnished, good facilities. We really enjoyed our time here."
8649257,50970920,2015-10-16,6965475,Lenka,me and my friends spendt in this condo 3 nights and we felt wery well. condo is enought spacious and new. House and neighborhood is quiet and nice
8649257,51076944,2015-10-17,2720263,Jamie,The place was clean and as depicted in the listing.
8649257,51476570,2015-10-20,4216537,Mitchell,Everything was very nice. The location was convenient being close to the convention center. The kitchen was well equipped and worked well for preparing meals. Nice local atmosphere. Much nicer than staying in a sterile hotel room!
8649257,52421123,2015-10-29,37946144,Jillian,Clean 2 bedroom condo in Boston.  We stayed in October 2015.
Pros:,,,,,
-Shawn is an excellent host.  If we reached out to him he promptly responded and resolved our concerns/questions.  He's really attentive and helpful.,,,,,
-Location is great.  You're not in the hustle and bustle of tourism,but you're only 1 T-stop away when you're ready for it.  Very easy walk from the T-stop.  Area appeared to be where locals live and we felt safe there. (Also walking distance to Target,a couple restaurants,and a few clothing stores.),,
-2 separate bedrooms at different ends of the unit were nice for privacy.  I slept comfortably in the bed.,,,,,
-The shower was hot and good water pressure.  Nice linens.,,,,,
Considerations:,,,,,
-The beautiful brand new couches do put off a scent that was a bit strong for me,so we just opened a window (I'm pregnant - scents hit me pretty strong) and that helped.,,,,
-You do need to be able to climb stairs to reach the unit.  Not a problem for us,"but thought I'd share.\"",,,,
8649257,53279350,2015-11-07,24966436,Samantha,"The condo itself is amazing. It's clean and bright. The location is perfectly placed near the subway which will get you quickly to downtown and anywhere else you need to go! You're near the water, near transportation, and food and bars."
8649257,53632276,2015-11-10,29800806,Kees,We started our trip in the VS in Boston and the apartment from Shawn is just great. Very good beds and a cosy living aeria. The T is close so a good start to see Boston.
8649257,54156291,2015-11-16,17165792,Jessica,"My friends and I had a great stay here. It was a nice neighborhood in a convenient location. The T (subway) was very close. We also had an Uber drive us down to TD Garden one night and the exit to get on the highway was right around the corner, so it was quick and simple to get into downtown. The condo was clean and provided all of the amenities as listed. We appreciated the convenience and comfort of our stay. I would stay here again upon going on another trip to Boston. Thank you Shawn!"
8649257,55419437,2015-12-01,25921401,Constance,"Shawn's apartment was amazing. The location is just perfect: 5 minutes to the subway (red line that gets you anywhere in Boston) and 5 minutes to a beautiful walk alongside the ocean. The place was really really clean and really comfortable: the kitchen had everything you could hope for (toaster, plates, glasses, pans, pots...). The rooms were great: really comfortable beds and towels for each guest."
We had a little problem with the heating system but Shawn was really responsive and fixed the problem really quickly!,,,,,
So thank you Shawn,"my friends and I really enjoyed our stay in Boston and your apartment was a big part of it! Will definitely recommend this place and come back if ever in the area! :)\"",,,,
8649257,56011338,2015-12-07,2401358,Linda,"Shawn's condo was exactly as described and he was very good with communication -- easy to reach via text. I had a pleasant stay with two other friends overnight. I had a few other people over for board game night and Shawn was fine with it, which I am grateful for. Parking may be a challenge on the weekend, but you can always park on the main/large street. Very accessible via public transportation. Lots of restaurants & bars around the area. Highly recommend!"
8649257,56342819,2015-12-12,49222676,Martin,Thanks for your hospitality Shawn. We enjoyed staying in the apartment which was conveniently located (shopping etc). We enjoyed walking in the park and playing basketball on the public courts. The recommended Pizza place within short walking distance from the apartment saw us as regular clients as there was convenient unrestricted parking in front and the shop owners made us a special treat every time.
"Thank you for your responsiveness to our needs and especially the extra blankets. We liked the apartment which was clean friendly and had over rooftop views!\"",,,,,

8649257,68002427,2016-04-01,59314584,Takiya,Sean's place was pretty nice!! Super clean and conveniently located near public transit. He was pretty easy to communicate with.
8649257,68363701,2016-04-04,14786850,Aniruddh,It advertises that street parking is available however there is  resident only parking and visitor parking is not available till atleast a mile away which also is always full.
As you enter the house,there is a steep staircase which had an extremely foul smelling odor. Once you enter the house,it certainly does not look as expensive or maintained as in pictures. Living room couch is uncomfortable to say the least.,,,
Both bedrooms had very uncomfortable beds with them being warped with both sides slanting thus making it very difficult to sleep.,,,,,
All airbnbs I have stayed in have always had teas,coffee,small snacks and bread for guests and basic toiletries .This listing lacked all of it.,,,
For the price point of 300$ a night a lot was expected and among the 4 of us,this was one of the couples first air BNB experience and they are weary of trying it again.,,,,
As for neighborhood,it's very shady at night.,,,,
"I will not be staying again in this listing and would rather do a hotel for this price point.\"",,,,,
8649257,69803943,2016-04-13,16039812,Sara,"We have just got back from a stay in this flat in South Boston. We appreciated the two separate bedrooms, pleasant living room and spacious kitchen. Shawn was quick to respond to our queries for more towels and a hair dryer which was much appreciated.  The gentleman who brought the things round was really helpful. The area is very near to the metro so easy to get in to town. We would recommend this condo."
8649257,72000513,2016-04-30,53868464,Shirley,"No complaints about the experience at all! It was nice and roomy with plenty of space for all three of us. We only stayed for two nights, and we felt comfortable being there both nights."
8649257,72555070,2016-05-03,69439201,Branislav,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was a good one. For the price of a hotel room we had 2 bedrooms and a functional kitchen, which, if you are used to cooking your own food and have been on the road for a week, is awesome. The place is clean and in a good neighborhood. (I am no expert on Boston, but I was there with 2 children and felt completely safe to walk around.) I was able to park on the street in front of the apartment on the weekend and during the day, (read the parking restriction signs) and at night I moved my car 50 yards in front of the Catholic church down the street. The red line Andrew station is a short walk away."
There is a convenience store around the corner with some basic supplies.,,,,,
"I would recommend Shawn's place to any of my friends.\"",,,,,

8649257,75059459,2016-05-18,70494745,Christiane,Clean and nice accomodation. Good location near to subway. In a nice neighbourhood. Everything was fine. We parked our car a few minutes away from the accomodation at the park and everything was fine.
8649257,77294311,2016-05-31,18839232,Felicia,PROS:
Place was nearby the ferry where we needed to go and close to downtown and the airport.,,,,,
Shawn responds quickly to messages.,,,,,
CONS:,,,,,
It was a hassle trying to get credit back from Shawn from an issue that occurred. I'm a busy person like everyone else and had to reach out to him twice to prompt a credit on his end.,,,,,
East coast and West coast usually have no central air,but be aware that there is no fan in the rooms or living rooms. AC unit in back room is loud and I could not sleep.,,,,
No toiletries and coffee.,,,,,

8649257,87581063,2016-07-20,55002629,Alan,"Whilst this was our first rent via airbnb we have rented property in Europe, Boston, New York, and Cape May over the course of the last 30 years or so. We are prepared to pay a reasonable amount but expect reasonable quality and value. On this occasion I'm sorry to say that we didn't think we got either. I know that this property has had many great reviews with only a couple of poor reviews but as the airbnb review guidelines state renters should 'provide constructive information that helps the community make better decisions'."
On arrival at the property our immediate reaction was of concern. The property looks tired and run down and whilst the whole property is not owned by the host,weeds around the steps don't create a great first impression. The stairwell is dark,grubby and unwelcoming and it is a steep climb to the top floor. Even the upper stairs and walls which are exclusive to the property are in a poor state.,,,
The apartment is clean and functional but that's about it. Whilst the photos are unquestionably of the apartment they show it in a better light than we found it. One of the bedroom doors had a hole half way up it and the other had a similar split. The kitchen has everything you need but the cabinets could do with sprucing up. Our biggest gripe was with the box spring of the double bed. It creaked so much that sleep was constantly interrupted. We contacted Shawn about this and he advised that it was brand new bed. He came and inspected it and acknowledged that it was 'slightly noisy' and would try to get it changed. It wasn't changed during the week we were there.,,,,,
We also had a problem with the WiFi/TV splitter which Shawn attended to promptly,even offering use of his own private WiFi in the meantime,which was a good touch. We had subsequent problems with the TV,which we only reported on departure as we'd come to the conclusion that were were going to spend as little time as possible in the apartment.,,
The final thing to report is on the area. The road itself is quiet and felt safe. It is also very close to a station,which takes you to Downtown Crossing in 3 stops. However,the area around the station is a meeting point for a few undesirables and we didn't feel that comfortable coming back to it late at night.,,,
So our experience wasn't great,"but others have found this place to be just what they hoped for. Maybe the fact that we were staying there for a week rather than for a couple of nights was a factor. I guess our view would be that if you take onboard at least some of what we've said then your expectations won't be disappointed like ours were.\"",,,,

The location was perfect as it seemed to be right in the middle of everything, just steps away from the park, no more than a 15 minute walk to any of the main sites. As per the space itself, very clean and plenty of linens, kitchen supplies, etc. Parking was very convenient, street parking was available  all weekend and the app to refill the meter was perfect as we were out and about all day."

Bed mattress and pillows were top notch (I've become very picky about this). Kitchen has the a decent selection of the equipment you need to cook and eat-in. Although if you plan on really cooking, note there are no basics like salt, oil, or aluminum foil."

9855805,68306903,2016-04-04,14884044,Brandon,This was a great little apartment and perfect for what we were looking for.  It comfortably slept 4 of us and was clean and well kept.  The location was better than we could have imagined.  The Beacon Hill area is one of the most exclusive in Boston and within walking distance of nearly everything you could ever want to do in the city.  I would stay here again without any hesitation.
9855805,69287300,2016-04-10,60354747,Martina,"Very good location, very easy entry instructions were very close. The apartment was nice and suited our family of four nicely"
9855805,72377295,2016-05-02,18491361,Robert,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this apartment.  We needed an early check in because of airline schedules and the rental agents were great in helping us arrange a place to drop our bags even though the apartment was not ready yet.  The apartment handled four of us easily and we loved the location.  At night street noise (cars) may bother some because this unit is on the front of the building, but we just turned the fans on the AC units at bedtime, and the fans drowned out all the noise.  We would certainly stay here again.  It is a very comfortable apartment in a fantastic location."
9855805,72857681,2016-05-05,66835491,Ryan,Our stay with Inn Boston was great. Everything was clearly laid out prior to arrival and allowed for a seamless stay. The place was clean and looks pretty much as advertised. The location was fantastic in an iconic neighborhood and was about a 15 minute walk into the Financial District through the Boston Common. I will be looking to stay here again upon my next trip to Boston.

The photo on the information is not the photo of the actual apt we stayed in and the apt we had was dark-- lights were sparse and dim, particularly in the upstairs bedroom where you needed a flashlight to select clothes to wear. Bathrooms were nice but very small--very small."
9855805,79328037,2016-06-12,20889999,Lulu,"This listing was great! It was slightly smaller than I had imagined from the photos but it's in the heart of Boston, so what do you expect? From the booking request all the way through our check out, it was extremely seamless. We received the check in Information a week before our arrival. We didn't have any interaction with inn Boston but we didn't need it. We liked being on our own and we had our plans already set for the weekend. Location was awesome, close to everything you need and if something was slightly further than our walking preference, uber was no more than $6-7 for one trip. We were also able to find extremely convenient parking right outside of the apartment for the weekend upon arrival so that was a plus. No complaints overall and would highly recommend!"

Check in directions led us to a different flat than the one reserved, late on arrival night.  The next day when we inquired there were apologies made for the mixup along with an offer of a discount to stay since this flat was not as well appointed.  We accepted.  Cannot review the flat in this listing but the one we stayed in, in the same building was clean and comfortable."
9855805,89080168,2016-07-26,60832543,Angela,The place was nice and clean.  The hosts were easy to get ahold of when needed. When people were on the floor up above us we could hear them walking around among other things which made it hard to sleep sometimes.  We were unaware it was on the forth floor which was challenging for our older parents. There was an elevator but it was very old and unsettling. The beds were very comfortable and the location was great!
9855805,92115692,2016-08-07,23929281,Corinne,Our family really enjoyed this lovely two bedroom flat right in the Back Bay of Boston.

Le istruzioni che ci sono state fornite per arrivare e accedere all'appartamento sono state precise e comode. Ci siamo trovati molto bene anche per quanto riguarda la posizione, poichè è vicina alla Downtown storica di Boston, ma ancora di più al quartiere di Back Bay dove si può passeggiare la sera in cerca di ristoranti e negozi senza dover prendere mezzi. Unica nota negativa: l'ascensore ci ha dato dei problemi in diverse occasioni ed essendo l'appartamento al quarto piano di un palazzo vecchio con delle scale piuttosto strette non è stato facile barcamenarsi con le valigie. Per il resto tornerei sicuramente a soggiornare in questo appartamento se ricapitassi a Boston!"

L'host è stata sempre presente,disponibile e molto gentile nel rendere l'ospite a proprio agio. Per citare un esempio mi ha fatto molto molto piacere quando una notte,a causa di lavori in corso sul ponte vicino la mia camera restava molto disturbata ed era impossibile dormire,Helena in quell'occasione è stata gentilissima e mi ha dato la possibilità di dormire in un'altra camera molto più spaziosa e indisturbata.,,
Il soggiorno è stato sicuramente confortevole e lo consiglierei a chiunque voglia trascorrere pochi giorni a Boston!,,,,,
Molto preziosi sono i consigli di Helena su quali eventi seguire in città e su cosa visitare.,,,,,
L'impossibilità di utilizzare il forno per cucinare si fa' sentire qualora il soggiorno sia maggiore di una settimana,"sicuramente un punto a sfavore ma in accordo alla descrizione fornita dall'host.\"",,,,

He checked us in, made sure we were ok, and we essentially had the place to ourselves.

The space is very true to the pictures. Despite being in their living room,I didn't feel disruptive to their living and I felt like I had privacy because they're out at work most of the day. Besides,how much time are you inside the apartment,it's Boston,there's so much to see and do.,
The location is brilliant,felt very walkable to downtown. Their location is so close to the Reflection Pool,which is gorgeous. And the metro/subway station is less than a ten minute walk from their place (as long as traffic is good,it takes less than an hour to get to the airport via public transit).,,

She made herself completely accessible whenever we needed anything.  She was quick to reply to all our questions, and was very accommodating to our needs.

This place was so cool and unique. A historic building renovated with modern design. Every detail of the place was thought out and excellent. It felt like we were the first people to use the place,everything was new and clean. It was a sanctuary to hang out and be at peace in after a long day exploring Boston.  Jamaica Plain is great and laid back with good food options (cool coffee/local food market,brunch etc..). It was no problem quickly getting into downtown on transit to sight-see.,,,
Sarah was a great host with excellent communication and over-and-above touches like freshly picked flowers from the garden and recommendations for things to do in the area/Boston on the whole.

2875267,23890053,2014-12-14,6439982,Greer,"Really nice renovated studio, perfect for a couple staying in Boston for the weekend. Loved having a full kitchen, even if we didn't end of using it for cooking. The bed was really comfortable and we really enjoyed the Netflix on our down time."
We did have a few hiccups with respect to some work that needed to be done in the lower level (not in our space) and even though it was a bit disruptive,Sarah handled it well and was communicative and worked around our schedules. It was a inconvenience,"but handled well and we could see it wasn't the norm. We would definitely stay here again when visiting the city. \"",,,
2875267,24705778,2015-01-02,5971831,Susannah,"We had a lovely stay at the carriage house. The space is beautiful, Sarah was easy to communicate with, and there were even freshly baked cookies on our arrival. There are great restaurants just a block away. Would definitely recommend this place!"
2875267,25264031,2015-01-11,22245896,Katie,"The listing is totally accurate.  Everything was just as described.  The space is really well laid out, and Sarah has thought of everything including maps of Boston, pens and paper on the desk - even a first aid kit in the bathroom!  The neighborhood is super cute - lots of great places to eat and shop with easy access to public transportation.  It was cold and snowy while we were there, but the carriage house was very cozy.  Sarah was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any questions.  We would definitely stay here and again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place in JP."
2875267,25870477,2015-01-28,19093769,Debra,"We recently stayed at the Historic JP Carriage House for over 2 weeks and thoroughly enjoyed every moment we were there. Sarah and Tom could not have been more caring and gracious hosts while also giving us our space and privacy. The Carriage House has absolutely everything you need for everyday living and the bed was so comfortable I slept better there than I do at home!  The Jamaica Plain area is a wonderful place to stay and there are quite a few nice restaurants, food stores, etc. within a short walking distance. If you have the opportunity to stay in this fantastic Carriage House, go for it. You'll be so glad you did! Thanks again Sarah and Tom and we look forward to many more visits with you!"
2875267,26027228,2015-02-01,12402657,Caroline,"We had a wonderful stay at the Carriage House.  The apartment was exactly as described, extremely clean and well-maintained, and they left shampoo and conditioner, soaps, eggs, coffee, juices and more.  The bed was very comfortable, the apartment climate was pleasant and had an easy control for adjusting, and despite over two feet of snow the off-street parking was plowed, salted and ready for use. There were great dining and coffee opportunities right around the corner, and it was convenient to our friends' house. Thank you for a lovely stay!"
2875267,28211871,2015-03-20,6023245,Penelope,"Wow. Where to start. This was one of the nicest places where we have ever stayed. The furnishings and decoration were beautiful-- the apartment was both an incredibly functional space, and a charming one. The bed was so comfortable, the kitchen was palatial and well equipped, and the the bathroom was beautifully designed. It was a wonderful, light-filled space, walking distance to the T, and honestly even nicer than in the photos. Sarah was not there during our stay, but was incredibly warm, kind, and helpful-- responding immediately to all of our texts. We loved the Carriage House, and can't wait to return."
2875267,28480377,2015-03-24,11799377,Jessica,"Sarah and Tom were wonderful hosts. Not only was the space clean, warm and inviting, but they made sure that we had all the necessities that we might need. Additionally, they offered to help acquaint us with the local neighborhood, which we really appreciated!"
"Thank you for a great stay!\"",,,,,
2875267,28701673,2015-03-29,4816196,Bridget,"We had a great stay at Sarah's guest cottage. She was away for the weekend but available to answer our questions. Comfortable bed, clean, great lighting, and kitchen with all the essentials. There were basic toiletries and a few groceries: granola bars, coffee, beer, tea, snacks. This is on a very quiet street about a block from a business strip in the neighborhood (restaurants, cvs, etc). We were there for a wedding in the neighborhood, so it was very convenient for us."
2875267,29001737,2015-04-02,4270666,Nicole,"Sarah was a pleasure to work with and extremely accommodating. The carriage house is every bit as lovely as it looks in the photos, and she went above and beyond with the small details that make an experience memorable. I highly recommend her listing to anyone looking for a beautiful, charming place to stay in the area!"
2875267,29286427,2015-04-06,28237919,Pamela,"Great place! Lovely decor and so much more space than you would find in a hotel room. It was nice to have space to kick back and all the basics needed to prepare meals at home if you want. Good links to the city centre via the Orange Line, but equally good options for breakfast, lunch & dinner just round the corner."
Sarah & Jeff are very discrete hosts. On hand if you need them,"but mostly just leaving you to get on with it. Thank you; we had a lovely weekend. \"",,,,

2875267,30373448,2015-04-21,3986030,Kelsey,The stay at the Carriage House was delightful. Sarah and her Tom are very accommodating and have designed the space beautifully and comfortably. I traveled with a friend for marathon weekend and it worked out great! Downtown is accessible and the home is in such a charming neighborhood. Great restaurants and grocery within walking.
2875267,30932078,2015-04-29,5656824,Marilyn,"We stayed at the Carriage House while visiting our daughter and her family.  It was very easy communicating with Sarah and our arrival went smoothly.  The apartment was as beautiful and uncluttered as it shows in the photos and was actually larger than we expected.  The location is great, we could easily walk to a variety of restaurants and to Jamaica Pond.  We were able to have our grandchildren come and visit with us.  We would definitely stay again."
2875267,31107073,2015-05-02,422192,Alisa,"The Carriage House was absolutely perfect for our trip to Boston. We had a fabulous time and the apartment made the trip so much better. Withing walking distance to the T, numerous shops and restaurants within a few mns walk, it was awesome to come back to this place after the hustle and bustle of Boston of being downtown. If we are ever in Boston again, this is definitely where we would stay. Thanks for a great stay!"
2875267,32806683,2015-05-22,4458741,Kaitlin,"Sarah was a super helpful, communicative, and awesome host. We rented her carriage house for the director of our television show for his stay in town during production and he LOVED it. He said it's the best place he's stayed in Boston in the 16 years we've been shooting the show. Highly recommended, hope to rent it again!"
2875267,33067159,2015-05-25,8797064,Claes,"Our stay at Sarah and Tom's carriage house was absolutely amazing. The room is spacious and everything was very neat and clean. Adding to that, Jamaica Plain is a lovely neighbourhood. Very calm and quite, with just a 20 minute drive from downtown Boston. We had a lovely time staying in the carriage house and can recommend this to anyone going to Boston!"

2875267,33493806,2015-05-29,14586071,Grace,"We had a very lovely stay at the Carriage House. The property was charming, clean and well-fitted with modern comforts and facilities. Sarah and Tom have done an excellent job with the interiors which are accurately reflected in the photos. Carriage House is located in a quiet neighbourhood within a short walking distance to a lively high street filled with cafes and shops and a 10-15 min walk to the local metro station with trains that take you straight to Boston downtown area. Sarah and Tom were very responsive and were fantastic and considerate hosts. I would definitely recommend the Carriage House to anyone thinking of a 2+ day stay in Boston."
2875267,33823033,2015-06-01,32524414,Lindsay,"The Carriage House was a great place to (URL HIDDEN) affordable alternative to downtown hotels with parking and a newly renovated kitchen- what more could you need?  Sarah and Tom were great hosts who made sure their guests had all the essentials for a comfortable stay, from toiletries to a wii.  We enjoyed exploring the the Jamaica Plains neighborhood as well as taking public transportation into the city, and would definitely recommend the Carriage House as a modern, tidy, and comfortable accommodation!"
2875267,34050037,2015-06-04,15660420,Jennifer + Sam,"Our stay could not have been anymore comfortable! Best Air BnB experience yet. Sarah's place was homely, convenient and well thought out for guests."
Sarah was also very quick to respond to our questions. And,"understanding when we accidentally lost our key! \"",,,,
2875267,34618373,2015-06-10,24397844,Julia,Es war ein sehr schöner und erholsamer Aufenthalt. Wir haben nichts in dem Appartment vermisst. Man hat sich direkt wohlgefühlt und es war alles vorhanden was man benötigte bzw. noch mehr :).  Es war sehr ordentlich und sauber.
Die Umgebung ist ruhig und man hat viele Einkaufs- bzw. Restaurantmöglichkeiten. Auch in die Stadt kommt man einfach und schnell.,,,,,

The neighborhood was great! Amazing coffee shops and restaurants were very close by. Tom and Sarah were lovely hosts. We would love to stay there again!
2875267,35572651,2015-06-20,25274412,Qiang,"The host was super friendly and gave us a short tour of the carriage house. The house is exactly as described, and even look better as I really enjoy the setting of the room. The neighborhood is tranquil during the day and at night and is also convenient to both subway stations and to a beautiful pond where u can walk and boating. Overall a really good stay and would recommend anyone staying in or near boston at this place! Would definitely consider staying again!"
2875267,36015346,2015-06-24,8827718,Thierry,Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre séjour a Boston. La maison de Sarah est telle que décrite dans l'annonce et l'environnement calme et très verdoyant. Tout est prévu pour que nous passions le meilleur des moments. Nous recommandons vivement cet endroit.
2875267,36365720,2015-06-28,7078754,Gretchen,"We loved staying at the JP Carriage House.  It looked exactly like the photographs.  Everything was very clean and the space is really well designed and decorated.  There is a great kitchen, if you decide to eat meals in.  They really thought of everything from coffee maker to umbrellas, sunscreen, guide books, white noise machine.  The neighborhood is great with lots of highly rated restaurants, coffee shops, and groceries within a block walk.  The train station is about 10 minutes away, but not a bad walk at all.  It is a beautiful place and Sarah was really great to deal with.  We would highly recommend JP Carriage House to anyone!"

2875267,36937269,2015-07-03,23309882,Alison,The carriage house is great! Great neighborhood and easy walk to the T. Had a great vacation and would recommend the carriage house to anyone.
2875267,37335139,2015-07-06,16057329,Steven,"I cannot imagine a more charming place to stay in Boston: A gracious host, a lovely carriage house, and a quiet, charming neighborhood."
2875267,37638541,2015-07-09,28474876,Timothy,"Modern, clean and spacious. It was our first AirBNB experience and first time in Boston.  We enjoyed our stay here. Just 10 min from the subway and near many restaurants and small shops. Nice to come back to the carriage house after traveling a long day and make our own food and watch Netflix. Tip: there is a skylight that brings beautiful morning light into the house, but it may wake the late riser -- bring an eye mask if you're sensitive to light."
2875267,38104147,2015-07-13,18651413,Peggy,"There are not enough superlatives to describe my experience at the JP Carriage House. Sarah was always prompt and enthusiastic in responding to emails. She was very accommodating with our earlier than expected arrival. The house looked exactly like the pictures. It just oozes charm with a combination of modern style and a nod to its historic past. Sarah left fresh flowers inside for our arrival and there were plenty of supplies in the kitchen and bathroom. The Jamaica Plain neighborhood was wonderful. There are beautiful homes and easy access to stores, restaurants, and public transportation.  We loved the proximity to the Jamaica Pond and Arnold Arboretum for walking, running, and biking. I only hope all my Airbnb experiences are as good as this one!"
2875267,38604724,2015-07-17,33887815,Ian,Very nice house and welcoming hosts. Sarah happily arranged for an extra bed to meet our requirement. We found all required facilities and more. The location is in JamaicanPlain which is a bit far from downtown (around 8 stops with the tube) and around 10 minutes walk from the nearest tube in Green Street. On the other hand the neighborhood  is very nice and safe. There is a wide variety of restaurants and pubs which is helpful if tired in the evening
2875267,38832573,2015-07-19,15222648,Ana,Great place & host!
2875267,39261100,2015-07-22,26000044,Dorrie & Marcel,Perfect place in a very Nice neighbourhood.
2875267,39500149,2015-07-24,34229935,Chad,"We absolutely love this place and wish we were staying longer! Sarah and her family are incredibly welcoming. Our 5 year old daughter was thrilled to find some books from Sarah's kids waiting on a little bed that had been arranged just for her...very thoughtful! She also loved it when the kids came over to invite her to play with them. The carriage house itself is the epitome of charm and style with all the modern conveniences you could ask for. Location is also great, very close to JP's Centre Street and lots of great dining and shopping options within walking distance. Can't say enough great things about this place...cozy comfort in a true urban oasis."
2875267,39737222,2015-07-26,2649411,Shula,Everything about this place was perfect. Close enough to the T station or Hubway bike rentals to get into downtown but also quiet and residential. Great places to eat are just around the corner (highly recommend Corner Street Cafe for brunch). Sarah was accommodating to our arrival and departure needs. The apartment has everything you need and is beautifully furnished.
2875267,40201026,2015-07-29,30236453,Clare,"I live in JP but don't have enough room in my small apartment, so we needed a nearby place for my dad to stay while he was in town. My dad had a wonderful experience at the Carriage House. It was clean, quiet, private and beautiful. Sarah also left us a bottle of wine and a few beers in the fridge. We couldn't have had a better experience. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking to stay in the JP/Boston area. We hope to use it next time my parents or in laws are in town."
2875267,40886298,2015-08-03,28372403,Peg,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and what a great one. Our hosts were warm, helpful, and accommodating, but at the same time gave us our privacy."
The Carriage House is everything you see in the lovely photos,and so much more. It is beautifully decorated,sparkling clean,comfortable,"and very private. It has every amenity. It was an oasis to return to each night during our very busy stay in JP. I highly recommend it!\"",
2875267,41578878,2015-08-08,3170374,Paul,"This is an amazing place! Beautifully renovated and extremely comfortable loft space on the top floor of the carriage house. We did not get to meet our hosts but still felt very welcome. If we have the chance, we will certainly come back. Oh, and did I mention that it has a wonderful bed...?"
2875267,42136445,2015-08-11,19755212,Kelly,"The Carriage House is lovely! The furniture is cute, and it somehow manages to be both modern and cozy.  Jamaica Plain is a pretty neighborhood with cute shops, restaurants, etc.  Whole Foods is within walking distance, and we bought groceries and cooked our meals at the Carriage House.  We also walked to the pond, and through the arboretum.  The orange line is a 10 minute walk - less when you aren't carrying your luggage - and we had easy access for a day trip into the heart of Boston.  Sarah was out of town during our stay, so she  checked in on us multiple times during our stay via text.  We had a lovely time."
2875267,42453967,2015-08-13,30103025,Maria,Beautiful stay!  Carriage house had a chic and modern elegance. Everything was impeccable!  Everything from toiletries to guide books and stationary!  Loved my stay. Very private and walking distance from local cafes and shops. Would stay again!

2875267,43352460,2015-08-19,27839870,Bella,"This place could not have been more perfect! As adorable in person as in the photos, super clean and comfortable (AC works great!) sweet thoughtful touches from the host. We were planning to spend all our time exploring Boston and were slightly concerned that we were staying too far away. What we didn't realize was that JP was a great place to explore in its own right and the carriage house is literally steps away from good food, cute shops, and the beautiful arboretum and Jamaica Pond and in a neighborhood of lovely homes and yards. And walking to the T was easy and pleasant. We took Lyft back from Boston a couple times which cost about $10-15 a ride. I can only think of one drawback- if you're hoping to sleep in, it gets really bright early in the morning with all the windows and skylights. We wanted to get going early and have full days, so this worked ok for us."
2875267,44404064,2015-08-26,403223,Laura,"Sarah was very easy to communicate with leading up to our trip.  The Carriage House was beyond expectation- very clean, very bright and well stocked with anything a traveler may need."

It rained one day when I was visiting and I was perfectly content relaxing in the Carriage House. It is fully equipped with anything and everything you could possibly need. And Sarah is extremely responsive and helpful. To top it off, Jamaica Plain is a cute neighborhood with lots of character. It is especially nice that so many restaurants, shops, and the Green St. T station are within walking distance. I highly recommend the Carriage House to anyone visiting the Boston area!"
2875267,46722753,2015-09-13,38858326,Heather,"Great experience! The carriage house is exactly as described.  Modern furnishings and decor, large open space, beautiful windows, pictures in listing are completely accurate. Even the details like the pens on the desk and the file holder are cute. The best two things: perfect Jamaica Plain location. Centrally located one block from Centre Street with lots of restaurants and shops. And secondly, this is a carriage house on a larger property so you have your own space, which you can see the outside from the pictures so you know this is true. When looking at other properties it's hard to tell if it's a stand alone building but in this case, easy to see it! The dogs and owners are nice and friendly. Book this place for your stay in JP. It's great."
2875267,47250562,2015-09-17,30719395,Ryan,"We absolutely loved our stay at the coach house. The accommodation was first class and we also loves the opportunity to explore JP, an area we may have overlooked if we had stayed downtown. Transport connections are great (15 mins to downtown) and I would have no hesitation recommending this accommodation to someone, who like us, wants to explore Boston. The specification of the apartment is amazing and we had everything we could possible need, plus great extras such as a bottle of wine and lovely coffee! Really hope to visit again and can't recommend this place enough :)"
2875267,48266659,2015-09-25,33010633,Helen,"Carriage House is a wonderful place to stay! It is just as described. Very good atmosphere, stylish and so clean. Jamaica plain is a beautiful neighborhood: Shops, restaurants and delis are very close. The Jamaica Pond is only a few minutes a way and a great place for a walk. All around the Carriage House there are beautiful old houses - and the Carriage House is one of them."
"Sarah is very friendly and helpful. Everything is well organized and the equipment of the location is of high functionality. We were very glad to stay there - Thank you so much!!!\"",,,,,
2875267,48864194,2015-09-29,31358718,Philippa And Mark,"Sarah and Tom have created a sophisticated, well-planned and well-equipped space which is ideal for the traveller. A lot of attention has been paid to design detail and those little extras that make you feel even more welcome and at home. Jamaica Plain is a beautiful area with some fascinating homes, making it well worth exploring. Travel into town is simple with a 5-10 minute walk to the train for an easy ride into the centre of Boston."
2875267,49202999,2015-10-02,157229,Rokos,"This is a knockout property - in most respects the best AirBnB property I've ever stayed in. Decorated with impeccable taste and with sylvan views that reflect all the very best aspects a foreign visitor imagines of leafy, affluent American surburbia, it's a house you wish you could kidnap and take with you."
All mod cons are present and correct (although TV is by Roku streaming only,no aerial or cable for idle channel-hoppers) and Sarah's hosting was faultless,with prompt replies to questions and lots of tourist-friendly information laid out for you. Sarah does seriously good AirBnB.,,,
Jamaica Plain is an exceedingly pleasant neighbourhood,with independent shops and a good choice of places to eat and drink literally a couple of minutes walk away. It must be said that it's a fair schlep from downtown. Green Street subway station is a 10-15-minute walk away but if you're exploring the city for the first time,your tired legs may eventually protest at even this; hop on the 39 bus instead,which takes longer,but you see more of the city and can switch to subway at Back Bay.,
This place is best-suited to visitors in Boston for longer than the few days we were,people in town on business or people who know Boston well enough not to need to explore it as intensively as we did. If we ever find ourselves in that lucky position,"we'd be back here in a heartbeat.\"",,,
2875267,49758245,2015-10-06,26679028,Stefan,Sarah and Tom gave us a very warm welcome and were also very helpful befor our arriving. The Carriage House was all we expected. Very modern and very well equipped in a great neighborhood and a short distance to public transport. We really enjoyed our stay!!! Thank you Sarah and Tom
2875267,50065319,2015-10-09,35979144,Evelyn,"We had a fantastic 3 nights stay in Boston and the carriage house made a big contribution to this. After long days in the city, it always felt like coming home. We loved the house and its style a lot and Sarah was a great host. We hope to come back one day an highly recommend it!"
2875267,50619989,2015-10-13,37526031,Sherry,"Sarah was very responsive to email questions prior to our arrival and welcomed us warmly upon our arrival. The Carriage House was exactly as it appears in the photos. It was filled with light and equipped with everything we needed. We chose this because of its proximity to family we were visiting but discovered its location was perfect for a stay in Boston. The shops and restaurants on Center St. were just a 5 minute walk away and the  beautiful Jamaica Pond was only 10 minutes away. The area is residential, quiet and a delight for those who adore Victorian homes. I highly recommend the JP Carriage House."

2875267,53227018,2015-11-06,13153453,Jessica,"In a word, superb. Private, parking, quiet, around the corner from Jamaica Plains' main drag. Lovely decor, nicely appointed, comfortable bed, good pillows. One tiny improvement would be a shelf in the bathroom and shower but you can improvise with a little ingenuity. But I wouldn't stay there if I were you because then what would we do when we want to come back? :). Just great. Kudos to Sarah and Tom."

Sarah was lovely, welcoming, and quick to respond to questions before and during my stay. She was also extremely thoughtful. Knowing I would be spending my time writing she moved a more comfortable desk chair into the apartment for me and when I arrived there was a bag of cookies on the desk with a note: \"\"Happy writing.\"\" Bliss.\""
2875267,53844339,2015-11-13,48031886,Fiona,"The Carriage House was just wonderful. While the pictures show the house well, it doesn't convey it's true feeling of warmth. Also, there were cookies to welcome me! Sarah was very responsive to my pre-arrival questions and I felt that if I needed to I could have knocked on their door. I look forward to my next visit to Jamaica Plain!"
2875267,54042151,2015-11-15,3024676,Arnaud,"Jeff was a lucky one, the carriage is a beautiful and recently redesign apartment what everyone should love. The plus is that's in a paisible area that deserve to be visited!"
Sarah and family are really warmheated,"and the apartment is ready for all your needs. Next trip to Boston might probably landed there again \"",,,,
2875267,54245536,2015-11-17,21660135,Stefanie,"Absolutely beautiful! Great location (11 minute walk to the T). The house is in wonderful condition. Fully updated and gorgeous. Lots of nice little touches, like a tea kettle and shampoos/conditioners in case you forgot. We took the T in during the day and that was a breeze. Über'd at night to Cambridge and Brookline. Both under $15. Would definitely stay here again."
2875267,54397730,2015-11-19,48200268,Chad,"This was an amazing find! Thanks to Sarah for hosting us. It was clean, super cute, in a great neighborhood and was extremely comfortable."
2875267,54579412,2015-11-22,43064458,Stephen,"Great place in a great location.  Immaculate and comfortable with well equipped kitchen.  Very convenient to public transportation, easy walking distance to excellent restaurants."
2875267,55673869,2015-12-04,13153453,Jessica,"I've run into this problem before. The place you've chosen to return to is so good that reviewing it presents a terrible dilemma: tell the truth and you'll never be able to book again; lie and you'll never be able to live with yourself. So scout's honor: Sarah does a very good job welcoming, communicating, and listening. One tiny complaint from our first visit is being addressed. Otherwise, the only thing that I would caution against is booking because you will incur my wrath. Just a great place; conveniently located for our needs; no-hassle, onsite parking; fast wifi; comfortable. But I will say this: we come to Boston constantly and have many things to do in different parts of the Boston metro area while there. This location is perfect for our needs but if you want to be downtown, don't stay here. If you want to be in the suburbs, don't stay here. But if you're just like us, stay here. No one is so, whew, it will be available next time we need it. Thanks, Sarah."
2875267,55929237,2015-12-07,7795473,Clare,"The carriage houses is bright, spacious and comfortable."

The place is beautiful, well equipped, spotlessly clean and very comfortable.  It is an easy walk to the T and an easy trip into Boston.  Jamaica Plains is lovely with lots of choices when it comes to eating out!  Sarah, our host, was easy to correspond with, she got back to us promptly and had left a very useful list in the apartment about the area and what to do in the unit, check out etc."
2875267,56487343,2015-12-14,2610007,Stephen,"The apartment was very pleasant to stay in. Very convenient location, close to the main drag in Jamaica Plain, and an easy drive to downtown Boston. The apartment itself was great, with a full kitchen and stylish bathroom."
2875267,56840933,2015-12-19,855320,Carolyn,"What a find – gorgeous. Sarah and Tom are consummate hosts – thoughtful, warm, helpful, and generous. Their JP Carriage House is fully-stocked with cooking supplies, creature comforts, and cleaned to within an inch of its life. Beautifully restored and whimsically historic, it sits in a quiet, but central location, with off-street parking. An all-season treasure – perfect for a romantic getaway or serious work project. Could not have been better. Most highly recommended to other airbnb guests."
2875267,57143835,2015-12-22,25811693,Mabel,"First time in Boston and had the pleasure of staying in this charming, beautiful house.  Everything was perfect! Tom was a great host and went the extra mile to make sure our stay was comfortable. The house is spacious and has everything you could possibly need during your stay. Also in a great central location near shops, train and restaurants. Will definitely keep this place in mind when I return to Boston!"
2875267,58885765,2016-01-05,19160532,Sharon,The studio was a wonderful home away from home for our visit. Sarah and her family were away until the end of our stay.  But Sarah made the studio very welcoming and easy to access.
"The Carriage House was exactly as stated and a wonderful place to stay in Jamaica Plain.  The location is perfect for visiting the area.\"",,,,,
2875267,59448288,2016-01-10,856485,Lisa,"Sarah's place was beautiful and super cozy! designed in great taste, with every comfort necessary to make one feel at home. We also love the neighborhood and the house is literally 5 minutes by foot from Centre street offering many restaurants, cafes and stores. We definitely plan to come back and stay here again in the future (assuming we can get a booking in spite of our great review!)."
2875267,60905654,2016-01-29,2047304,Brandon & Sarah,The carriage house is exactly as described;  It's beautiful and the location is ideal.  I travel to Boston a lot and I hope to stay here many more times. Sarah and Tom are wonderful hosts. The process was seamless.
2875267,61156273,2016-02-01,48878790,Michael,Thank you Sara for sharing your beautiful Carriage House with me. I felt like I was staying in one of those HGTV renovations that I always wish I could live in.
The location is perfect for relaxing or exploring the shops and many neighborhood restaurants.,,,,,
My stay was PERFECT!,,,,,
"I look forward to returning Soon!\"",,,,,
2875267,62036232,2016-02-10,2047304,Brandon & Sarah,I travel to Boston frequently and I truly hope I can stay here every time.  It's exactly as described and Sarah and Tom are kind and easy to communicate with.  The experience is top notch.
2875267,62813055,2016-02-17,30236453,Clare,"This is the second time that my parents have rented the Carriage House while in town to visit me. And hopefully it won't be their last! I can't say enough good things about this Airbnb. It is quiet, clean, spacious, well located and beautifully decorated. Sarah is a wonderful host; she had everything ready for them to arrive and even left them a bottle of wine in the fridge. Thank you for another great Airbnb experience!"
2875267,63733518,2016-02-26,8081868,Lisa,"Fantastic place to stay- my teenage daughter and I spent two nights at the Historic JP Carriage House and could not have been more pleased.  The apartment is super clean and decorated with a keen design eye.  The location was superb, the bedding was comfy and there is a well equipped kitchen."
"Exceeded our expectations- thank you so much Sarah for a fantastic stay!\"",,,,,
2875267,64155413,2016-02-29,48570711,Peggy,She was in touch by email and text and was flexible and helpful.
2875267,64475352,2016-03-04,2301269,Marisa,"I had a terrific stay at the JP Carriage House. Sarah made checking in and out very easy. And, although I didn't have a chance to meet Sarah in person, she was a perfect host -- she was very accessible and made sure I was comfortable. The JP Carriage House is beautiful and comfortable -- even better than described. I am looking forward to my next stay. Thank you Sarah."
2875267,64674477,2016-03-06,60130394,Navjit,"Sarah was very accommodating, allowing us to check in at whatever time suited us. Additionally, we loved the look and feel of the carriage house, simultaneously having both a modern and historical feeling. The location is also fantastic, as we were able to take the Orange Line into Boston fairly quickly, and were quite literally steps away from a number of restaurants and stores. Loved it. If you are looking to stay somewhere in the Boston area, but would also like a quiet, lowkey feel, this is the perfect location."
2875267,66197827,2016-03-20,46366,Samantha,"The carriage house has everything you hope for in an Airbnb! GREAT location (neighborhood feel but city convenience), private (the space is intimate and away from the main house), beautifully decorated (with all modern conveniences) and a friendly host! Sarah was very quick to respond to all communication. We had a fantastic weekend in JP and have recommended the space to all our Boston-bound friends."
2875267,69946069,2016-04-15,13632661,Deborah,"Sarah welcomed us with a delicious bottle of wine, flowers and many other treats, as well as a kind welcoming note. We loved the simple and modern furnishings and equipment. The apartment was immaculate, and so well arranged--it really felt like it was three separate rooms. It was easy and fun to stay there and we look forward to coming back. Love the neighborhood, too."
2875267,70717592,2016-04-20,47547871,Lisa,"We recently stayed at the Carriage House while visiting Boston to run the marathon. The condo is beautiful, and Sarah was a perfect host. Extras like a bottle of wine in the fridge and dining guides on the desk were appreciated and so sweet. The metro station was an easy walk, there were lovely run paths nearby at the pond and a variety of restaurants within easy walking distance. I would return in a heartbeat and highly highly recommend!! Huge thumbs up!! ❤️"
2875267,71380420,2016-04-25,2231754,Claire,"What a wonderful gem of a place! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Carriage House.

2875267,71933664,2016-04-29,5988470,Nikki,"Beautiful spot in central JP!  A true urban oasis.  Sarah was easy to communicate with and all felt very smooth and easy.  On behalf of my parents, thanks for a great time!"
2875267,72416583,2016-05-02,19566041,Karen,"The house was just as described.  Everything was very clean, the furnishings were comfortable and functional, the bathroom was modern, the kitchen was well stocked with cooking and eating equipment.  The home is unique and very quiet.  There is a skylight so it does get light in the mornings.  We would return if we are in need of a place to stay in Jamaica Plain."
2875267,72829979,2016-05-04,48264837,Bryan,"This was my best Airbnb stay to date. The space was clean, inviting and well equipped with everything I needed during my business trip. I had meetings downtown as well as some outlying areas and found it to be conveniently located to both."
2875267,73018721,2016-05-06,62960911,Edmund,"Everything was as described, even better.  Our stay at our host's Carriage House was very comfortable. Would definitely book here again. Neat and clean  - just the way we like them."
2875267,73716271,2016-05-09,9062689,Cornelia,We stayed in Sarah's carriage house for three nights. It was exactly as pictured and a few short steps from restaurants and cafes in JP. We got to meet Sarah and she was so nice and welcoming- answered all of our questions and texts. We would definitely stay again and could not recommend this place more!
2875267,74191341,2016-05-13,27127498,Leonardo,AMAZING place. 5 stars!
One of those houses you would think that only exists in houses' magazines. I wish I lived in place like this! So beautifully decorated,fully equiped with high quaility products,very comfortable bed and sofa,huge TV,nice lights,very tidy and clean.
Sarah looks after every detail. She even left some chocolates and other things in the fridge,and maps and books about Boston.,,,,
The neighborhood is lovely. Beautifull houses,one after the other!,,,,
You can park in front of the house. Driving to downtown could take,,,,,
around 20 min.,,,,,
Across the street there is a children's playground,very well equiped,and 2-3 short blocks away you will find markets,nice restaurants,etc.,
"We will definitevly recommend this place!\"",,,,,
2875267,74724239,2016-05-16,19160532,Sharon,"This is our second time staying at the Carriage House and, again, we loved it.  It's perfect for visiting family in the area and is a wonderful space to spend our time in (when we are there!)."
Sarah is great although we see little of each other.  She makes it so easy to arrive and leave at our convenience.,,,,,
"We would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
2875267,75651022,2016-05-22,38012278,Rosie,"We had a fantastic stay here. Sarah had left a bottle of wine when we got there - always welcome! - and the house is as lovely as it looks on the photos. It's a 10 minute walk to the T which was great and only 25 minutes into the centre of Boston. It's a 2 minute walk from loads of restaurants and shops and a couple of bars but still very quiet, and a lovely, lovely neighbourhood. Felt like we got a proper slice of Boston, rather than staying in a faceless hotel. Would definitely recommend and definitely stay again if we come back this way. Thank you!"
2875267,76347416,2016-05-26,5212907,Brandon,"Sarah's home was an absolute treat. The Carriage house is so nicely set up and designed. It's extremely clean and with loads of natural light. It also has so many great amenities like a rain head shower, AC, and a nicely set up kitchen including a dishwasher. The location in Jamaica Plain is also hard to beat. So many great restaurants (Ten Tables was our favorite) in walking distance and just a short trip to anywhere using the nearby Charlie. We look forward to staying here again the next time we visit Boston."
2875267,76678486,2016-05-28,2132590,Suzanne,"This is a lovely, light-filled studio in a cute neighborhood with lots of  restaurants and amenities.  There is a well-stocked kitchen and the studio is very clean. The neighborhood is very quiet.  There is a nice yard with outdoor furniture should one wish to spend time outdoors.  Hosts were very prompt with communications and answering all questions.  A nice alternative to staying in Boston city Center but within easy reach."
Read all of the materials Sara provides...she has thoughtfully offered a white noise machine and eye shades located in a drawer,both of which were helpful to me as a light sleeper.  The morning sun comes in early and is pretty bright! My only (very minor) complaint was the fold out couch is rock hard and did not allow for a restful sleep. That said,"I don't think that the house is advertised as being comfortable for more than the 1-2 people who would sleep in the bed.  We were grateful that we had the option of a second sleeping space when our son's flight was cancelled and he needed to stay with us one night-for which there was a $10 charge.\"",,,
2875267,77353826,2016-05-31,65225558,Andrews,My wife and I had a WONDERFUL stay at this quiet treasure in Jamaica Plain. The neighborhood is pretty magical with delicious foods of all types just minutes away. The orange line is about a 10-minute walk from the house and provides easy access to just about anywhere you would want to visit in Boston.
The actual property is very clean,modernly designed,very safe and quiet. The bed is comfy and there's so much beautiful light. Pure relaxation. Sarah and Tom were incredibly accommodating and friendly. They've outfitted the place with just about everything you could use on your trip: toiletries,"accessories and even beer/wine. They even invited us to join them in their kid's birthday party fun. Would definitely stay here again—no hesitations!\"",,
2875267,77689702,2016-06-02,19489734,Ericka,"Great location! The neighborhood is very nice and friendly. Sarah was very helpful providing tips, and ways to get around. The home was very clean and comfortable. Loved the decor! I would definitely stay again if given the chance!"
2875267,78125685,2016-06-05,26217146,Cristina,"Wonderful place in a very pleasant neighborhood. By far the best accommodation (AirBnB or hotel) we had in 5 cities we stayed in US. Sarah's place is decorated with good taste and equipped with literally everything you might need. I always appreciate it when you are offered not only the standard, but also the extra mile that makes you feel great. Loved the fresh flowers on the table, also the bottles of water and some beer in the fridge we found when we arrived. We tried 4 of the places Sarah recommended: the sandwiches place (City Feed & Supply), the JP Licks gelateria and the Centre Street Cafe, the Whole Foods supermarket, all very good options. I hope we'll have the chance to return to the carriage house one day!"
2875267,78687246,2016-06-08,53514831,Gary,"Sarah's place is beautiful and peaceful, in a quiet leafy neighborhood. Yet literally steps away from restaurants, bus, and a bike share station. The studio is spacious, with all the comforts you could need. This was my first time staying in Jamaica Plain, but I will certainly be back."
2875267,79310876,2016-06-12,30841808,Michael,"Outstanding accommodation in a very quiet, charming neighborhood. This space is a quick walk to the T station (Orange Line), the Sam Adams brewery, and an easy drive to/from the airport and Boston Proper."
We really enjoyed the wonderful space with great amenities and comfort. Our home away from home in Boston gave us a great respite after a few busy days. Sarah was amazing and kept up great communication and was super friendly. Loved meeting her and the kids. Sorry we couldn't meet Tom,"but definitely hope to be back again in the future.\"",,,,
2875267,80021858,2016-06-15,38336385,John,"A bright, tranquil setting, beautifully designed with an impressive array of amenities distinctive of a home away from home; it is so comfortable and private, in a beautiful neighborhood, very handy to the Boston subway system and all the splendid features that distinguish Jamaica Plains within the Emerald Necklace. It met our expectations and more. Sarah and Tom were perfect hosts, attentive, helpful and prompt in responding to our queries. Meeting their pets, Harold and Maude, and imagining Jeff's Nineteenth Century life within the Carriage House was a distinct bonus! We highly recommend this property and would definitely return. Thanks again!"
2875267,80325794,2016-06-17,67326511,Carol,This place was amazing!  We were able to feel right at home instantly in this quaint place.  She had fresh flowers and a bottle of wine waiting on us on our arrival.

We were greeted with flowers, champagne, and sweet congratulatory note from Sarah and Tom and they were very responsive during our stay. The loft is impeccably decorated and so functional. It is in a beautiful neighborhood with amazing houses, food, and drink, and Boston is easily accessible using public transit. I highly recommend the carriage house to anyone traveling in Boston."
2875267,83015312,2016-06-30,5819685,Alice,"This carriage house is the perfect place for a quiet space conveniently located in  Jamaica Plain. The large space has everything necessary to make the stay comfortable and welcoming- a very comfortable bed with lovely bedding, a huge shower , a modern kitchen and a seating area with TV. It is really well done as far as the decor goes. Sarah is the consummate host and I recommend this home highly."
2875267,84149760,2016-07-05,57462342,Trevor,"For our first vacation/AirBnB together, the carriage house was picture perfect! Being greeted with a bottle of wine, flowers, and a note from Sarah and Tom made us feel right at home. The location was perfect and close to local restaurants and the T, which was great since we were sightseeing in Cambridge and Boston for the 4th of July weekend. The carriage house was spacious, had more amenities than we could’ve imagined, and we simply didn't want to leave. Thank you for allowing us to stay in this amazing space and we cant wait to be back!"
2875267,85848127,2016-07-13,406113,Alica,"Staying a the Carriage House was amazing. It is beautifully decorated, equipped with everything you could possibly need and in a great location. The house was super clean and the bed really comfortable. There are several good restaurants and grocery shop close to the carriage house and it is a short commute to central Boston. We had a wonderful time at the Carriage house it is in a beautiful neighborhood. Parking is available, the hosts are super nice and really helpful. I would highly recommend staying at the carriage house."

2875267,94906478,2016-08-17,48261299,Jean,"The carriage house listing was accurate.    We do feel the description should include that there are 15 narrow steep steps up to the living/sleeping area. We did not have difficulty. However, if someone has bad knees or a wide girth they would have difficulty."
We didnt have much interaction with owners.,,,,,
The neighborhood felt safe.  We walked to restaurants with ease,"\"",,,,

We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood and liked that it was within walking distance of Samuel Adams Brewery and the Arnold Arboretum. We did encounter a few minor issues during our stay: we ran out of toilet paper and had to make a CVS run (luckily, a convenient trip), and the toilet flusher was loose/unhinged, which occasionally made flushing the toilet difficult; however, these issues did not impact the overall stay, which we really enjoyed. I would recommend this house to anyone interested in traveling to Boston. A great experience!"

I felt as though JD and Erin went above and beyond to help me out as I was moving to the Boston area,making references to neighborhoods and calling people they know.... JD even dropped me off to a location that I needed to visit.,,,,
They even give you a few goodies that you may or may not need/use in your room like soap,mints,bottle water,a snack bar,etc.,
Neighborhood: The neighborhood is quiet,yet very accessible and easy to get around,"with everything you need within a few blocks.\"",,,

Erin and JD immediately made me feel right at home, we're very easy to communicate with, and the dogs were friendly and extremely well-behaved. The room itself is comfortable, clean and quiet, and the house is less than a ten minute walk to restaurants, stores, coffee shops and public transportation.

I was living in Boston prior to my stay with them they were definitely one of the highlights of my last days in the city. Both were extremely helpful with my situation (moving out of the country), they were always extremely nice and just great to hang out! we almost immediately became friends. They even let me store some luggage a few days prior to my stay with them to facilitate my move. Also, Lexie and Millie (their dogs) are extremely adorable and well behaved, which made my stay that much more pleasant."
I can't recommend these guys enough for your stay,"and I know that the second I'm back in Boston they will definitely be my first choice.\"",,,,

hanging out at the house with them was like hanging out with old friends. we kicked back each night for a couple of hours chatting while playing with their 2 wonderful dogs,lexi & millie. very laid-back atmosphere,which was nice.,,,
their home is really conveniently located near lots of shops and restaurants,and most importantly for anyone wanting to venture into boston,close to lots of bus stops!,,,

Erin and JD are very warm and friendly, and as are their fabulous dogs, Lexi and Millie.  Our hosts offered lots of helpful information and welcomed us to use what we needed in the kitchen. The house is in a nice, quiet neighborhood away from the busy downtown hub.  We had to take both bus and train to get downtown, but that was a fun adventure once we found the bus stops.  Bottom line:  staying at \"\"Must Love Dogs\"\" feels like you are visiting friends and we'd do it again in a heartbeat.\""

After a week long bicycle tour throughout Massachusetts and New Hampshire we needed a place to stay before we had to get back to New York. A simple bed would have been enough. Instead we got Erins place - Jackpot! Not only did we get a warm welcome from JD who showed us around, our room was nice and clean, with a comfortable bed and fresh towels (you have no idea how great this is after one week \"\"on the road\"\"). And like in a 5 star hotel we were provided with a basket full of snacks"

They are the nicest people and it was is if I knew them for years.  The accommodations were exactly as shown, clean and comfortable.

We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived! The room is a great size, with such a comfortable bed - it was our best night of sleep the entire week we were in Boston. The house is cozy and E&J have made sure to accommodate you with maps, goodies, toiletries, etc. Make sure to put your pin on their world map showing where you're from. Their home is in a wonderful location - a quick stroll to downtown Brighton (make sure you stop at Mandy and Joe's for breakfast), with a mini-mart just down the street for any last minute needs. We definitely recommend booking here and know next time we're in town, we've got a great place to stay!"

Their neighborhood is easily one of the best places to go out for a drink and some great food, but even though we didn't get the chance, judging from the short time we did spend together, staying in and hanging out with Erin, JD, Lexi and Millie would have been a lot of fun!"
The house was very clean and their dogs,"very friendly. I hope the next time I'm Boston bound they have a room available.\"",,,,

They have two great and well trained dogs that made the stay even better for me and my dog. Erin even made a little bed for my dog right next to my bed which I thought was a very nice tough. 10 out of 10!

De la maison de Erin et JD, il est possible d’avoir accès au système de Bus amenant vers Harvard ou le centre-ville de Boston. Les hôtes nous ont fourni une carte de bus/métro afin de faciliter nos déplacements. Nous avions accès à tout dans la maison (cuisine, salle de bain, frigidaire, …). Merci !"
This Airbnb is really great,my wife and I recommend this place. The hosts were really helpful (they give us a bus/T card) and friendly (we took a good IPA beer when we arrived with Erin et JD). We had access to everything in the house. We share the place with the host and they respected our privacy and were really quiet.,,,,
Thanks Erin et JD!,,,,,

The house is located in a nice calm locality in a beautiful area. It just 2 minutes to the bus station and a few minutes to the T station.  Lots of restaurants,shops and pubs are just a short walk. Street Parking is freely available.,,,,
The house is cute,its simple and elegant. The bed is super comfy!!  Its super clean and nice and cozy!,,,,
They have a nice basket will all the small nick and nacks and stuff which was really very nice!,,,,,
The idea of pinning where you came from on the map where you came from was super cool!!,,,,,
About the Hosts:,,,,,
Erin and JD are one of the nicest people I've ever met.,,,,,
They are a lovely family with the cutest set of dogs Lexi & Mili.,,,,,
They made sure that we were comfortable at their place; they went out of the way to make sure we were comfortable. One night I decided to crash on the couch instead of the bedroom one night they were so sweet before I got out of the room,the couch was already laid down with sheets and pillows.,,,,
Their place has felt like home and didn’t feel like you were at an Airbnb!,,,,,
Chatting up with them was like catching up with old friends. It didn’t feel like we just knew them from 2 days. We spent like several hours chatting up without realizing where time flew. It was the best evenings we had in Boston.,,,,,
It might sound cheesy but thanks for making my trip memorable and all the very best to both of you!,,,,,

3601424,31088421,2015-05-01,2655219,Julie,"Erin was so kind to make the room available to me on a last-minute basis, and didn't mind my terribly late (or early morning as it may be) arrival. JD was even still up when I arrived."
The house was nice,the dogs were charming,and the room fantastic. Think: super comfortable bed,cozy sheets,a privacy lock,and a care basket should you need kleenex
My only complaint was that I didn't get enough time with the dogs. And,about those dogs: The little one was very social,the bigger one was talkative when I arrived,then disinterested after a good sniff of my bags. Also,if you are ambivalent about dogs know that they won't give you a second look if you're in the house when Erin isn't. (Next time,I'm bringing doggy treats for bribery.)
"Great first AirBnB experience. \"",,,,,
3601424,31365334,2015-05-04,343842,Jane,The location of this house was perfect for a meeting we had at WGBH and Erin and JD's hospitality elevated the experience.

If I am in need of a room again in the Boston area, I would definitely check their abvailiblitity first.  There was ample parking right outside, the house was easy to find, the room (and whole house) was fresh and clean. Their dogs were amazingly well behaved."
"I also enjoyed Erin and J.D's company - I had been in the car for 6 hours driving from NYC to Boston - traffic was horrible - I was greeted with a smile and a glass of wine.  I would HIGHLY recommend to everyone to stay at \"\"Must Love Dogs\"\"!!!!",,,,,

After a long day exploring in Boston, their home was warm and welcoming to come back to. Both JD and Erin were quick to respond to texts and messages, friendly and helpful upon arrival, and gave us plenty of space to spend time with each other. The room we stayed in was beautiful; the bed was heavenly. With all of the little thoughtful amenities they provided (Chewy bars, maps, big fluffy towels, UNO, etc.), it felt just like staying at a hotel but with the company of two adorable well-behaved dogs as well. The location may be a little from the main city area but was within walking distance of the buses and the neighborhood was beautiful and felt very safe.

There was easy parking, well functioning air conditioning  both in the room and common space (it was hot outside), great shower pressure and lots of little luxuries such as plush towels.

3601424,43252744,2015-08-18,37603450,Kristen,"It was a pleasure staying with Erin and her pups. Although we flew in late Thursday night, Erin waited for us to arrive and answered all of the questions we had about sites to visit and means of transportation around the city. We enjoyed everything about our stay! When we visit Boston in the future, we will be looking to stay with Erin again."
3601424,43668232,2015-08-21,39865621,Ashley,Erin has a wonderful home and did a fantastic job of getting us set up for our first day in Boston. We planned on seeing both downtown Boston and the Harvard campus in our time which made this location the perfect in between. Even though our trip was very short we were glad we chose to stay with Erin for the night. Thanks for everything!!
3601424,43869556,2015-08-22,4323659,Katrin,Erin's house was the perfect place to discover Boston and Harvard's campus by train and bus. We enjoyed staying with Erin and she gave us some useful tips on what to do and was very hospitable.
3601424,43921891,2015-08-23,18702123,Ben,The house and room were extremely comfortable and well cared for - the bedding was especially nice. Erin's communication before and during the visit were excellent. She is a very considerate host - highly recommended.
3601424,45380090,2015-09-02,37172812,Laundon,"Very accommodating and pleasant hosts. Comfortable bed. Good amenities. Clean. Quiet neighborhood, close to good food and shops. Cute dogs."
3601424,45953598,2015-09-07,34796664,Chingyun,Feel really sorry about checking out 30 minute late
Because we forgot the check out time,,,,,
It's our fault.,,,,,
But I don't think we need to be scolded and threatened even when we had left the house,,,,,
It's really scared us,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3601424,46390632,2015-09-10,39837757,Julia,We had a very nice time staying at Erin's home. The room was set up very nicely and we enjoyed the plush towels as well as the very comfi bed. Their 2 dogs are very well behaved.
3601424,46880567,2015-09-14,2852908,Brenda,"Erin and JD were awesome hosts!!  Erin was always quick to reply to my messages and answer questions. The room was great!  We enjoyed the snacks and water in the basket and the bed was super comfortable. The world map on the wall was cool, as you could place a pin as to where you were from. It was fun to see where all their visitors had come from. Millie and Lexie are great dogs!!  So fun to stay at a home that has pets. This helps when you miss your own fur babies back home. The location is in a great, safe neighborhood and getting downtown to the tourist sights was pretty easy. I also appreciated that there was parking at their home for my rental car. I definitely recommend staying here!"
3601424,47058419,2015-09-15,931032,Yael,"Nice and comfortable room, lovely neighborhood. We only stayed for one night, but in that short time Erin was very nice and helpful."
One thing - the apartment is not near the airport,so if thats a neccessity,"this is not the right place. \"",,,
3601424,47278177,2015-09-17,26509238,Zengjun,位子有點偏遠 但是一間很舒服的房間
3601424,47501456,2015-09-19,42009048,Carol,Erin was welcoming and helpful and even did some laundry for us which was kind. The location is a little further out of town than we realised but public transport is good. The house could do with a lick of paint and looked somewhat worn. The dogs were friendly.
3601424,47758104,2015-09-21,42399254,Eva,"Very nice, uncomplicated hosts. The room was very well presented and also very clean. We felt very comfortable there."
3601424,48403193,2015-09-26,37149618,Aurélia,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour. L'accueil était chaleureux, la maison était conforme à la description. Erin et JD sont à l'écoute et très arrangeants. L'accès au centre ville est facile mais un peu long. Nous recommandons cette maison."
3601424,48697281,2015-09-28,38679010,Anita And Lee,"Erin, JD and Lexie and Millie were so welcoming! We completely enjoyed and greatly appreciated their hospitality. They were so helpful and overall great hosts. We hope to be able to meet up again with them in the future!"
3601424,48923903,2015-09-29,20358783,Mary,I had a great time staying with Erin and JD. They gave us a great dinner recommendation and when we got back we chatted for hours and got to watch the blood moon with them and their neighbors. I truly feel like I have friends to visit in Boston now.
3601424,49230888,2015-10-02,40660815,Wendy,"Erin and JD were relaxed hosts. We felt very welcome in their home, and appreciated the thoughtful touches and helpful tips. The bed was incredibly comfortable, great shower with the bathroom located right next to the room. Nice suburb with plenty of food options nearby and easy to get to Boston central on the bus and T. Excellent communication."
3601424,49471821,2015-10-04,42870611,Janice,Had a wonderful experience with Erin and JD. Both are very friendly and gave us great recommendations for dinner and sight seeing. The room was comfortable and had everything we needed. Would highly recommend Erin and JD's place for a nice home-away-from-home experience.
3601424,49607904,2015-10-05,29417537,Nicole,"Erin and JD were awesome. After we arrived in Boston, we decided to stay downtown to walk the Freedom Trail prior to dropping our bags off and Erin was accommodating to our changed schedule. When we finally met, they were very welcoming and shared great insights into the culinary options of their city. After taking JD's excellent advice on a seafood restaurant, we joined them later on that evening in their home for glass of wine and great conversation. The room and bath was clean and we felt like it was home. They made our stay in Boston that much more special. Thank you again."
3601424,50488073,2015-10-12,43731809,Michael,"Had a great (though very brief) stay at Erin's place. She and Jeff were very friendly and made me feel very comfortable staying. I felt welcome to mingle as much as I liked, and when I shut my door, they gave me privacy. A great experience all around."
3601424,50644479,2015-10-13,27663218,Caro,La chambre et le lit étaient très confortables. Les hôtes très sympathiques. Je recommande.
3601424,51261278,2015-10-19,28698365,Nanny,Ik zal het nogmaals in het Nederlands schrijven.  Dit is gemakkelijker.  De kamer was perfect in orde.  In de kamer was een mandje waarin verzorgingsgerief lag dat we konden gebruiken. Er lagen propere handdoeken.  Ook mapjes over Boston lagen in de kamer.  De douche was zalig.  Erin en JD waren supervriendelijk.  We voelden ons direct thuis. Het is een warm koppel dat mensen direct op hun gemak kan stellen.  Het huis ligt in een veilige en rustige buurt.  We mochten ook vragen stellen over alles van Boston en omgeving.  Ik zou zeker terug gaan naar deze mensen als ik nog eens terug naar Boston zou gaan.
"Het enige spijtige is dat we op de morgen van vertrek de Erin en JD niet meer gezien hebben om nog afscheid te kunnen nemen.\"",,,,,
3601424,52225523,2015-10-27,43341003,Aino,"Erin and JD were excellent hosts: very welcoming, helpful and considerate. The place was exactly as described and the dogs were lovely (and stole my dad's heart). The location near Brighton Center worked well for us and the bus takes you downtown easily. Highly recommended!"
3601424,52343900,2015-10-28,44785948,Linda,"Erin and JD were great hosts. They made my short stay very comfortable and relaxing. The room was nice and clean, everything was as described. The bed was comfortable and the shower was great. I would recommend this place to anyone who visits Boston. Thank you very much!"
3601424,53271398,2015-11-07,7554487,Jeremy,"I had a great stay at Erin and JD's place. It's a block away from many stores and restaurants in the Brighton area. I was greeted by two lovely dogs and JD was very helpful with giving me suggestions of transportation and stores. I didn't get to meet Erin because we were never at the same place at the same time.  Nonetheless, Erin was my point of contact since I first booked and she made communication very easy between us. I recommend this place to anyone that is in need of a private room and a warm welcome to Boston."
3601424,53644800,2015-11-10,9816745,Jason,My daughter and I came to Boston to watch the Patriots game and it worked out great.  The location is conveniently located off the Mass Pike with free on-street parking.  Erin and JD and their dogs were all very nice us.  They were great hosts.
3601424,54282587,2015-11-17,29896628,Colette,"We didn't get to meet Erin, but she was great over the app. JD was a great host who was flexible, helpful, and fine with quality time or letting you be. The room is an absolute dream and better than a hotel in my opinion, because it has everything and is also secluded and comfortable like home. This listing is such a friendly and beautiful environment that I almost can't believe I stumbled upon it by chance."
3601424,54597057,2015-11-22,29316022,Jay,"\"Erin & JD (and their two kids - the dogs) were everything you could want in AirBNB hosts. They were super friendly to talk to, had a great, inviting home, and are people you can call \"\"friends\"\" in a matter of minutes. Furthermore"
3601424,54898287,2015-11-25,31459990,Emily,"We had a great time staying with Erin and JD, their house was lovely and they made us feel very welcome. They were very relaxed and helpful, the bed was super comfortable and their dogs were great! Would definitely recommend. Thank you both! :)"
3601424,55771735,2015-12-05,24382928,Maddie,"Erin and JD were lovely hosts.  Easy going and super friendly, their dogs were sweet too.  The room was cozy and the bed very comfortable, with the bathroom nearby.   We will totally stay here again if we come back. Thanks guys!"
3601424,56131219,2015-12-09,47908203,Roxanne,"Well, we never actually met Erin (we kept missing each other), but we met her wonderful partner, who made us feel very welcome.  And their four-legged friends helped me not miss mine so much! We also appreciated the bus pass with a little change on it that was left for us - very thoughtful, and what a great idea!"
3601424,62420053,2016-02-14,9007277,Ginny,"Erin is a great host! Even before arriving, Erin kept contact and made sure we were going to get in while they were working. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by her lovely dogs and a lovely room. Everything was near and clean. She provided us with towels and all kinds of amenities. We left soon after checking in, and when we came back late at night, there was a lovely note that told us where to get extra blanket if we needed any. She was very thoughtful. Great place to stay!"
3601424,70557560,2016-04-18,43049407,Ansley,"Erin and JD were GREAT!  I mean the place had good reviews so I had pretty high expectations, but they went way above and beyond those.  Their home is very nice and comfortable, and we loved the location.  Erin immediately gave us recommendations of places to grab dinner and had take-out menus for us to go through.  She even offered to cook us a pre-race pasta dinner the night before the Boston Marathon!  The bedroom was very well made up and the bed was SO cozy!  Everything was neat and clean.  Erin also gave us a card for the bus (with money on it!) and told us exactly how to get there and where we would need to get off for our final destination."
"We thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Erin & JD and loved playing with Lexi & Millie (their two doggies).   This was definitely our best Airbnb experience all around!  \"",,,,,
3601424,74132159,2016-05-13,28401643,Shannon,"Erin and JD are wonderful hosts. The location is excellent and there's always on-street parking. The location is close to most major bus lines and there is plenty to do on Washington Street, just two blocks up. Take time to toss the ball to Lexi and give Millie plenty of love. Enjoy some conversation with Erin & JD as they are great people in addition to being wonderful hosts."
3601424,99673521,2016-09-05,89591289,Zeyu,"We were in Boston for a traveling. The house was nice and Erin and JD are very good person to talk to. Erin have given us a metro card that we can use to take the bus and the train, and they also have given us a lot of suggestions on where to visit and where to eat."
11885148,76053077,2016-05-24,8265608,David,"Esteban was a great host. His apartment was exactly as described and centrally located in downtown Boston on a street lined with traditional brownstones. Gorgeous to stroll down. Esteban had the apartment ready for us on arrival and was always willing to provide advice in a timely manner, via email or phone. I would recommend Esteban to anyone."
11885148,98753965,2016-09-01,41741260,Gregor,The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13015353,92046531,2016-08-07,87354899,Leslie,This is an excellent location walkable to many points of interest and close to restaurants and shopping.  The place was very clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood and building was quiet.
13015353,92885901,2016-08-10,4393332,Karen,"This is a nice space -- large living room, office space, kitchen and half bath downstairs, upstairs is just a landing with the en suite bedroom and bath. Updated appliances and modern furniture inside. Location is great and on a quiet tree-lined block, easy walking distance to many things. Flexibility with the check in and check out is great."
Cleanliness was a notable issue,though,and there were some disrepair issues with the building overall,like no lights working in the building lobby or vestibule. There were some rough edges around the rental,like the bedroom TV never getting to work. While Attuck was pretty responsive,he could've been more helpful in communication
13872339,85428979,2016-07-11,19417913,Catherine,Safia's brownstone apartment in Back Bay is absolutely beautiful and so close to all the best areas of Boston. We enjoyed our stay immensely and would recommend this place to all future visitors.
13872339,86209090,2016-07-15,35709041,Sophia,"Safia's apartment was perfect for my coworker's and my week in Boston. She had multiple keys, it was an absolutely stunning place, and overall she was just very kind. I've been meaning to use Airbnb for a while so this was the ideal first experience and definitely sets the tone for many more."
13872339,91717935,2016-08-06,846520,Roza,"The place is SIMPLY WOW! And the host is very kind, nice and the most informative and is very prompt. Loved the stay. I am a business traveler and I will be back very often."
13872339,92879539,2016-08-10,61697727,Ash,The best decision ever to stay here. Super host. Amazing experience.

12304165,71080592,2016-04-23,1897858,Courtney,"Lea's place is huge, and in an amazing location! Although the room is a bit bare, you have access to your own private bathroom in the hallway. Super great. Lea was super laid back and checked in to make sure everything was great. If I'm back working downtown, I'll definitely be back."
12304165,73779121,2016-05-10,1793274,Rachel,"Great location! We walked mostly everywhere, and took the T stop just a couple blocks away. We even walked back from Fenway after a Sox game, and it was so quick."
12304165,74841310,2016-05-17,46879511,Xinyue Grace,Great location with a fair price! The dog is nice and friendly! My parents had a great time staying there!
12304165,75273456,2016-05-20,213024,Puja,"Lea was a good host--easy to make arrangements with, and responsive to inquiry. This was a great experience--the room was airy, spacious, and clean. The location is directly on Newbury, so theres many shops, cafes, and restaurants. I was walking distance to the hotel where the conference was held."
A 5 or 7 minute walk to Copley station. The room is sparse--no TV or unnecessary furniture. The WiFi works well. The bath is proximate and private for the guest. Jo the dog is well trained and is friendly,"but stays away completely if you dont prefer dogs. \"",,,,
12304165,75888387,2016-05-23,66965682,Ian,Great spot and excellent host! Very welcoming and accommodating and it truly is in an excellent location. Having your own room and bathroom was nice and Lea's beautiful dog was super friendly and fun. Would definitely recommend staying here!
12304165,77414431,2016-05-31,12245935,Ian,The location is perfect. Right in the middle of Back Bay on one of the most lively streets in Boston! Lea was very accommodating and answered questions very fast.
12304165,78309412,2016-06-06,72759319,Lisa,"Lea was a wonderful host and had the most adorable and courteous dog, which made my stay extra lovely. The location was better than I could ever ask for. It is right on Newbury where all the action is and close to public transit, bars, restaurants, shopping - everything. At first glance I felt the room looked very bare and gloomy but by the end of my first day I realized it was comfortable and much better than renting a hotel since i was able to cook as often as I pleased and do laundry when I needed to. Overall I would definitely stay here again."
12304165,79325076,2016-06-12,75293593,Megan,Lea's place was great! Really awesome location and a really comfortable bed. Place was clean and quiet for the location.

Lea's place was in a perfect location to EVERY THING (shops, dining, subway, Charles River, etc.) The bedroom and bathroom were also very neat and clean.  We for the most part had the place to ourselves. I would highly recommend Lea's place to anyway staying in Boston."
12304165,86555113,2016-07-17,76023738,Sean,Picked up keys at local establishment with sufficient warning regarding how finicky the outdoor locks are.
Location is great. Close to many sights,and close to a subway to the rest of the sights. Good places to eat close by.,,,,
Room has a bed,a desk,and not much else. Bed was clean and comfortable.,,,
Best for a trip where you do not plan on  staying in.,,,,,

La camera è spaziosa e dotata di bagno privato nel corridoio che costituisce comodità non indifferente. Consiglio senza ombra di dubbio di soggiornare da Lea nei vostri viaggi a Boston."

12304165,95332076,2016-08-19,10572066,Linda,A very nice location and overall a good experience.  The substitute host (Lea was out of town) was very helpful.  A few small improvements have been suggested to make this a very comfortable and convenient experience. The kitchen is located on a lower level that is reached by a narrow spiral staircase which may be difficult to negotiate for older guests.
1628130,88139651,2016-07-23,28978658,Lauren,"Hylton was an amazing host. He helped us with everything we needed. He was friendly and super accommodating. The house itself was wonderful. Loved all of the furnishings. It was a comfy and inviting space. The area was also great. The neighborhood was quiet, but near some cute restaurants and a little main street area. We would love to go back to this beautiful space in the future!"
6347026,32869532,2015-05-22,8793209,Renee,"Megan and Stephen made me feel so welcome in their home! I had freedom to come and go as I wanted and there were plenty of places to eat and little stores within walking distance in Southie. I walked to the T to commute to work; the red line stop was a little less than a mile away, but it was a nice walk. Their home was absolutely beautiful and brand new - they only moved in 3 weeks prior! I appreciated having my own bathroom and a spot in their private garage. The bed was so comfortable and everything was very clean. I would definitely stay here again!"
6347026,33728754,2015-05-31,16730934,Richard,"Stephen and Megan were great hosts. The room in the apartment was impeccably clean and very cosy, private bathroom and a possibility to park the car in the garage was a cherry on top. I would definitely recommend my friends staying in this place!"
6347026,33975437,2015-06-02,2830735,Joshua,"I arrived close to midnight, and Megan waited up and welcomed me into their beautiful home.

Megan was friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. They are proven hosts, and it shows!"
6347026,35601363,2015-06-20,13825246,Jay,"Megan and Stephen opened up their home to me and my fiancé, not only for comfortable accommodations for two nights, but to be used as a backdrop for our wedding video. The house is incredibly immaculate. Every little detail has been incorporated into the home, making our two night stay that much more comfortable. The house has so much natural sunlight and we definitely appreciated the eye masks provided in the room. Megan and Stephen were so supportive of our filming throughout their entire home that we were able to complete our shoot earlier than expected. We want to thank Megan and Stephen for giving us one of the best gifts we could've asked for."

6347026,36038178,2015-06-24,252679,Patti,I was in town for an evening event so I didn't arrive until 10pm and there was this cute couple with a glass of red wine for me.  Their townhouse is stunning - right out of a magazine. The bed is super comfy and the bath is stylish and immaculate. I left first thing in the morning so I didn't get to explore the neighborhood but what I saw from the cab looked good.

We highly recommend anyone trying to stay in boston to stay here! You will not be disappointed, we ourselves will be returning without a doubt!"
6347026,41405597,2015-08-07,13231691,Paula,"Our flight to Boston arrived early. We called Megan and she kindly made arrangements for Stephan to meet us at the apartment early. When we arrived he showed us our room and the layout of the apartment, which was bright and very lovely. This was our first time with AirBNB that we shared an apartment rather than having the place to ourselves. We found it a little awkward to have our bedroom and bathroom so close to our hosts, but that's just us. The townhouse was immaculate and beautifully decorated."
The bedroom was very nice and the bed very comfortable. The upper portion of the window let in light from streetlights and early morning sunshine. Our hosts provided eye masks,but we would have preferred a window covering.,,,,
"We brought back some muffins for breakfast the morning after our arrival and were a little disappointed that there wasn't any coffee or tea available. Other than that we really enjoyed our stay. We used Uber to get to and from downtown Boston and the fare was very reasonable...less than $ 10.00.\"",,,,,
6347026,41652062,2015-08-08,10073213,Ingrid E.,"Stephen and Megan were wonderful hosts! We communicated with ease, having a spot in the garage for our rental car was great! I cannot really start to describe how magnificent, luxurious yet comfortable our stay was! They directed us to a lovely restaurant  in their neighborhood.  They invited us to meet a guest they entertained that evening from my birth country , which I appreciated very much. They also  gave us great advice how to get into town and the proximity to the airport was so important! It was the best bed I have ever slept in!"
"We will certainly come back!\"",,,,,
6347026,41778697,2015-08-09,15618372,Todd,Stephen and Megan have a great place and did a great job communicating with us prior to our arrival.  They even helped us set up our first Uber ride!! Wonderful place to stay-we will be back!!
6347026,42530422,2015-08-14,34147718,Samantha,We just had a 2.5 week road trip and spent two nights here. This was our favorite place including other airbnb and hotels. It was very clean and private. Everything they could have done to make our stay perfect was done. Having a place to park was great. Even though the place isn't downtown Boston it was super easy to walk anywhere we wanted. Stephen and Megan were really nice and great hosts and easy to get in touch with for any questions! If we are ever in Boston again we won't hesitate to book here!
6347026,42864908,2015-08-16,35599392,Ashlee,We stayed at Megan and Stephen's place for 2 nights and we wish we could've stayed longer!
We arrived earlier than expected in Boston and Megan accommodated and let us check in early which we were so grateful for.,,,,,
The house is in the perfect location as it's only about 10 mins from the airport and is about 15-20 mins away from other places of interest.,,,,,
The bedroom and bathroom both had a lot of natural light coming through which made the rooms feel nice and fresh.,,,,,
Megan also offered us a darker room downstairs in case of being light sleepers,which we appreciated the option.,,,,
The house was very clean and looked exactly as pictured. I personally loved the style of the house as it was simple and neat.,,,,,
Megan and Stephen gave us some tips about the local area and where to go. Overall they were great hosts!,,,,,
"We'd love to stay here again if we ever come back to Boston. \"",,,,,
6347026,44059432,2015-08-23,41771163,Wesley,"Stephen and Megan were very accommodating in letting us check in early because of our flight in. They made us very welcome in their beautiful home, and everything is just an Uber ride away. We didn't spend too much time at the house, but the hosts were very friendly while we were there. If we visit Boston again, I wouldn't hesitate staying here."

6347026,46088918,2015-09-07,43224313,Glenn,"My son and I enjoyed our stay with Stephen and Megan.  They were  friendly, easy going, and very accommodating.  Their townhouse is beautiful, just as described, and very neat......immaculate.   We met them, right on time, and pulled right into their garage.  No worries about finding on street parking which is kinda nice.  Stephen gave us a key, and we had the place to ourselves.   All things considered, this was for us a great place to stay; better than any high priced hotel room."
6347026,47353145,2015-09-18,36891874,Anna,Excellent first airbnb experience! They were very accommodating and flexible around my arrival time and helped me out in the morning as well. Very responsive to communication prior to my stay.

The private room and bath were perfect for me for my business visit to Boston. I'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
6347026,49425529,2015-10-04,35299737,Debbie,"Steve and Megan were fantastic hosts, who have a beautiful home just like it looks in the picture.  They could not have been more friendly and helpful, and although we were sharing the space they are in fact often not in the main living area, so it was like we had our own private townhouse.  With a private garage immediately under the house, this location works particularly well if you would like to have a car while you are in Boston.  I would thoroughly recommend this as a place to stay.  Thank you, Steve and Megan!"
6347026,49822142,2015-10-06,19834819,Mary,"Stephen and Megan are both delightful and have a lovely spot in South Boston, convenient to the Convention Center. I felt welcomed, comfortable, and they were very helpful in offering things like cosmetics/toiletries, take-out menus, and letting me know I was welcome to the common spaces. The bedroom I stayed in, and indeed the whole house, was immaculate and beautifully furnished. A+++ AirBnb experience."

The townhouse is described perfectly and is in fact even better in reality. We had a wonderful 2 night stay before travelling around New England. The house is around 15 minutes from downtown Boston by taxi - Steven even helped us to set up an Uber taxi app for really cheap and fast taxis- about half the price of standard taxis with friendly local drivers. The kitchen and living areas are so stylish and comfortable and the bed really comfy too.  Steven even contacted us after we left and posted my husband's phone to our next hotel! Thanks again Steven and Megan and yes, we'd thoroughly recommend this property and the hosts!"
6347026,51895212,2015-10-25,11295239,Shirley,A vet warm welcome and a delightfully appointed house. We had a very comfortable room with an adjoining bathroom. Stephen and Megan were very gracious and helpful hosts giving us good tips about local places to eat and using Uber as opposed to public transport. Our only regret is that we could not stay longer!
6347026,52392411,2015-10-29,6898741,Heleen,"I had a very nice stay with Stephen and Megan! There was good contact in the days before, we could make good arrangements to meet each other. The bed- and bathroom were very nice, very well decorated, cosy and clean; the rest of the house was also super!"
They both were very nice to me,made me feel really welcome and at home. They were also very helpful with all the questions I had. The wifi worked great by the way.,,,,

6347026,53074641,2015-11-04,14055039,Andrea & Adam,"This was the most professional airbnb experience we've ever had.  Stephen and Megan were polite, kind, and easy to talk to.  The house was brand new, and the bedroom, as well as the bathroom, were exceptionally bright and clean.  The TV had endless stations, and there were waters and snacks at the bedside - you didn't even have to worry about an increase in the bill if you consumed them like you would have if you stayed down the street at a hotel!"
"We highly recommend staying with them.  We'll definitely be back if we're in the vicinity and need a place to stay!\"",,,,,
6347026,53107724,2015-11-05,1489426,Christine,"We were greeted at the door of this lovely townhouse by the owners, Stephen and Megan.  Very comfortable, got a good night's sleep. This place is a great value, spotless, and easy to get to from the airport.  All images are correct."
6347026,54389082,2015-11-19,4274669,Charles,"I only had the pleasure of meeting Megan, and she was very welcoming and made me feel right at home right away.  Their house is brand-spanking-new and clean as a whistle.  There is a Zipcar location pretty close which was really easy for me to use.  Access to the listing was very straightforward, and the room was very comfortable.  I'd totally stay there again."
6347026,54925949,2015-11-25,42080997,Sarah,Megan and Stephen have a beautiful home and they were great hosts during our short stay in Boston. The small gestures like chips by the bedside were definitely appreciated after a long day of travel. The bed was really comfortable as well! Having a garage parking spot in Southie is a huge perk as well. Would definitely recommend!
6347026,55285634,2015-11-29,34487170,Martin,"Stephen and Megan were very welcoming. As soon as we pulled up, Stephen was there to meet us and helped us pull our car into their garage. Once we got inside, the both of them spent the next 5 minutes familiarizing us with the rest of the house. Our stay was great, the bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was clean and big, and the rest of the house was beautiful. Fantastic kitchen, we were able to warm up our left overs several times. The hosts also offer free chips inside the room, and also allow you access to free canned soda."
6347026,55627577,2015-12-03,24181120,Catherine,"Stephen and Megan were so welcoming and made me feel very relaxed during my stay. Their apartment is lovely, really clean and comfortable. Communication with them was very easy and they were happy to suggest some restaurants and give advise on things to do / getting around. They were kind to accommodate a late check out for me on the last day which helped me out greatly. They were very good hosts and I would recommend them."
I would mention though that the proximity to the airport means you can hear the planes fly over from about 5am,so it may not be the best choice for light sleepers.,,,,

6347026,55708144,2015-12-04,21725440,Manny,"The host made us feel very welcomed. I felt like when I stepped into the home, I was stepping into my own home. They were very respective of our personal space and provided all accommodations. They were very descriptive in their tour of the home, so that we did not need to bother them once we were all settled. They provided us with insight about the neighborhood and landmarks to go see, which we took them up on. Very clean, very comfortable, AirBnB done very well."
6347026,56156692,2015-12-09,4274669,Charles,Another great stay with these guys...super easy.

The house was absolutely beautiful, equipped with everything needed for a very comfortable stay. As hosts, Stephen and Megan gave me plenty of advice on what to do and where to go. The house was close to plenty of restaurants and cafes, it was also only a 20 minute walk into town."

The place is as beautiful as it looks in the  pictures,very clean,and spacious. My friend and I were in Boston for a conference and all of our other friends were jealous of how much nicer this condo was than the surrounding hotels -- and it was only a 15 minute walk to the Convention Center. The next time I'm in Boston,"I'd love to stay here again!\"",,
6347026,59744163,2016-01-14,15349798,Alejandro,"I booked with Stephen and Megan last minute (day of) for business. They were really accommodating and friendly, very nice folks. The place was neat, modern, and very easy to come and go."
Had a very private experience considering it was a rented room vs apartment and we never got in each others way. Nice to have a garage to store the car and took Uber to go to meetings (Ubers were everywhere).,,,,,
There is a cool little downtown district with cafes,bars,restaurants about 2 blocks from the rental with everything you could want.,,,
Stephen and Megan went the extra mile to make sure I had directions,knew where everything was and kept really good communication.  I decided to stay an extra day at the last minute and they again provided superb service. Happy I made the trip and will plan on contacting them again next time im in Boston.,,,,

6347026,61938451,2016-02-09,4274669,Charles,My flight situation got really complicated due to weather. I finally got in really late and they were very flexible and understanding of the situation. Cheerily met me at the door at 2:30 am!

She waited up relatively late and even printed out a document for me that I sent while en route.  As the pictures show, this place is spacious and ridiculously clean and nice.  Everything is new and works perfectly.  The convention center is an easy 15 minute walk.  If you are coming to Boston for a conference, this place is every bit as good as an expensive hotel but at a better price.  I am a successful airbnb host in Manhattan myself, so take my word for it that Stephen and Megan are running a first class airbnb operation."
6347026,66088229,2016-03-19,24142801,Kate,"We were a few minutes late, and Stephen checked in with us by text.  He met us at the front door and was a perfect host.  He escorted us to our room, showed us the bathroom, gave us the wifi information, and even taught us about UberX.  He then left us to our own devices, and told us to make ourselves at home.   There were snacks and maps in the room and all the necessary amenities in the bathroom."
6347026,66377149,2016-03-22,26897220,Robyn,The hosts were welcoming and very friendly and helpful. The townhouse is beautiful and kept immaculately clean. It is a boutique hotel experience. Loved it.
6347026,66924735,2016-03-25,48443354,Jordan,Stephen and Megan were excellent hosts! They both greeted us with warm smiling faces. The home was immaculately clean and just as beautiful as the pictures suggest. There were snacks in the room upon arrival and the room was great!
The area seems to be growing extremely fast,which may be why there was a lot of construction happening near this apartment. Be aware that you may wake up to city sounds of gentrification and construction in the early hours of the morning.,,,,
We walked into town which took a little longer than expected from the house (45 mins),but a cheap Uber ride takes you almost anywhere in the city.,,,,

6347026,75638379,2016-05-22,17919010,Diana,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a great one! Megan and Stephen's home is absolutely spotless and looks just like the photos. They were accessible via text message, which made coordinating and asking questions very easy. The bed was super comfortable and the water pressure in the shower was great. If I were describing the neighborhood to a fellow New York City resident, South Boston feels like a combination of Long Island City and the South Street Seaport -- there is a stretch of restaurants/bars along the water, but the area felt a little industrial/empty after dark.  The garage was great, but a bit of a tight squeeze for our Chevy Cruze rental car. The guest room/bathroom are right next door to Megan and Stephen's room, so we were also a little worried about using the TV or making noise coming home late. We took Ubers everywhere; $8-$10 to Back Bay, $14 to Fenway."

Their home was immaculate. From the kitchen to the bedroom to the bathroom,everything was SO clean. I even joked with them during check in that their home looked EXACTLY like the pictures. Their bed was extremely comfortable and the house overall very peaceful and quiet.,,,,
The location of their town home is not central to Boston's main tourist attractions,"but we actually enjoyed getting away from all of that at the end of each day. It was so easy to hop onto the T from Broadway and go anywhere we'd like AND it was only about a 10 min drive from the airport which made flying out convenient. We are definitely staying here again the next time we're in Boston!\"",,,,
6347026,78728274,2016-06-08,7468248,Ryan,It was a rainy Sunday night when I arrived. Megan & Stephen stayed up waiting for me and even put the latest episode of Game of Thrones on pause to make sure I was welcomed first.
That's evidence of two great hosts and greatly appreciated as I know how serious people are about Game of Thrones. They could've said something like,"\"\"Door's unlocked","come in quietly please as we'll be watching Game of Thrones.\"\" :D",,,
I was welcomed right inside and given the tour of their beautiful house. It's an immaculate place to stay and rest. It looks just as great as the photos show,if not better. We briefly chatted about what I was doing in Boston and received great recommendations for places nearby to get brunch,etc... I then got settled in and let them get to their episode.,,,
The place is in a great location in Boston,Uber/Lyft were never far away and it was easy to get into downtown or really anywhere I needed to go. Surprisingly even during rush hour and heavy traffic.,,,,
I was up and at it early in the morning for the three days I stayed with Megan & Stephen. I only wish I had more time in Boston to enjoy the city and take them out for drinks or dinner for being great hosts. I plan on attending the same conference next year and if it all works out I'd definitely seek out their place again. It's definitely a hot commodity as you can see from all of the reviews,"so get in line and enjoy a few nights here. :)\"",,,,

The property was conveniently located to Milton and an effortless drive.  After the long day, I was looking forward to a good night's sleep;  Needless to say, I slept like a rock!  The temperature and comfort level was just my speed. The accommodations outweighed any boutique five star hotel I would have ever visited.  Megan and Stephen were likeminded and great hosts.

Du coup, on dort avec un duvet en plein été, mais pas réellement gênant. Pas possible d'obscurcir complètement la pièce, mais pas un souci pour moi car éveil aux aurores à cause du jet lag.

238846,642215,2011-10-18,702831,Ruth,"Brahma was extremely congenial, helpful and cooperative.  We are grateful for his hospitality.  The location of the apartment and room arrangements inside the apartment were very convenient for our situation.  On the negative side, one of the bedrooms is very small.  Much of the remodeling and redecorating that Brahma has done in his building have been done very well.  The Blossom apartment, too, will be more attractive and comfortable when Brahma has completed his projects there.  We highly recommend that you contact Brahma if you are looking for reasonable accomodations in that part of Boston!"
238846,1562659,2012-06-25,2672521,Rockman,Although brief our stay at Blossom was very enjoyable. Brahma spent some time explaining where everything was around the area and even gave us a bit of history in Boston. He went above and beyond what we expected. Definitely worth staying again!
238846,1884543,2012-08-04,2338193,Robert,Accueil très sympathique. Le logement a beaucoup de charme. Le centre ville est très accessible. Bon accueil. Brahma nous a founi beaucoup de renseignements sur la ville.
238846,7953262,2013-10-09,9111171,Kathy,"\"Brahma was a great host overall , answering all our questions and making sure we knew where things were in the apartment & the East Boston neighborhood where the apartment is located. He has a lot of knowledge about Boston history & landmarks if you are interested in this. Brahma was called out of town unexpectedly but checked us in over the phone and \"\"upgraded\"\" us to LOTUS ( which is on the 2nd floor of the 3 story building ) & is described as a\"\" Luxury Apartment.\"\" The location of the rental was perfect for us but this isn't the ideal neighborhood for most travelers. It is a working class & lower income area with lot's of trash littering the sidewalks & streets. A supermarket is a 20 minute walk but there are small corner Mom & Pop Latino markets every few blocks. The main plus is the close location to Logan airport & T station making getting from & to the airport a breeze. The city provides a free shuttle to the airport @ the station! Also a great Mexican Restaurant Angela's which serves a tasty breakfast & offers fresh squeezed OJ is just a few steps away. LOTUS"

Brahma est un hôte très sympa et disponible,il est de bons conseils ! Il nous a orienté vers un très joli parc près de la maison avec une vue imprenable sur Boston. Nous étions 4 et sommes resté 3 nuits,tout s'est très bien passé.,,,
Le quartier est calme,il faut compter 10 min de marche pour aller au métro et 10 min de métro pour se rendre en centre-ville,,,,
Le plus: le balcon,,,,,
Le bémol (s'il faut en trouver un...): la pression de la douche ;),,,,,
Sachez également que si l'annonce indique une capacité de 4 personnes,il y a un canapé lit donc vous pouvez tenir à 6 (prévenez bien sûr l'hôte au préalable!),,,,

The room and bathroom were very clean, Wifi is fast, and the house location is fantastic. T station is about five minutes walk, the neighborhood was quiet and safe, and the famous bakery cafe Ula and Samuel Adams Brewery is also about 10 minutes walk.

749247,4082131,2013-04-08,5493223,Alice,Patti and Javier are the most remarkable hosts. They provide a warm clean lovely home and a genuine interest in sharing time and ideas with their guests. They live in a very successful cohousing community and happily took the time to respond to my interest in their community giving me a tour and answering endless questions. I only wish that I lived in Boston so I could see them more often. I'd absolutely stay with them whenever I am in Boston.

Kids were playing, birds were chirping, it felt very safe and welcoming (I was fortunate enough to visit during a gorgeous week weather-wise)."
After introductions,I was escorted to the guest room of their townhome. The room was clean,the  bed was comfortable,and they even left clean towels for me on the night stand.,,
The neighborhood is awesome! As my first time in the Boston area,I am thankful I chose Jamaica Plain and Patti and Javier's place. Walking distance to great food,coffee,and breweries. Oh and the Metro is a 2 minute walk away.,,

It was a holiday weekend, so they were actually on their way out of town, but were very friendly and beyond accommodating in suggesting things for us to do and see. Their daughter was also very helpful in helping us choose restaurants to dine in that were nearby. The apartment is right by the T station which made it easy to get into the city. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience! The area is very safe and fun, and the room was perfect. Couldn't have asked for a better experience!"

They live in a really cool cohousing development which Patti worked as one of the heads of the project to build from the ground up. Staying here is similar to staying in a condo, but the neighbors are much more friendly and the activity of daily life is much more cohesive."
P & J were extremely friendly and welcoming from the moment we contacted them. Patti provided us with all of the information we needed to get to their home from the airport and then provided us with a thorough list of suggested restaurants and bars in the neighborhood. They engaged us is fantastic conversation,provided us with coffee and anything else we wanted from the kitchen.,,,,
The bedroom is that of their daughter,who is away at school. The bed is extremely comfortable,private,and easily accessible to the bathroom.,,
Upon leaving,we booked a 6am flight,not knowing that the T did not run early enough for us to get to the airport on time. So Patti insisted on waking up at 4am and driving us to the airport.,,,
Really,you couldn't ask for better hosts,"or even better people. If I lived in Boston I would make sure to befriend Patti and Javier. \"",,,

It is a beautiful home and I got an entire bedroom to myself with a comfortable twin size bed. I cooked myself some vegetable noodles in the kitchen and there was Wifi to surf the internet.

All of them are very easy going and make it very comfortable to use the kitchen and come and go as if you really were a family guest. And I enjoyed our morning encounters and conversation over coffee as everyone prepared to get out of the house for the day. The room and the bathroom are appealing and the house has easy access 5 minutes away to the subway and a cafe. For me it was a pleasurable look into Bostonian lifestyle and way of thinking. As I visit Boston frequently, I would certainly return with pleasure."
Ich ließ mich selbst rein ins Haus von Patti,Javier und Carlos und das Gefühl,einfach ein willkommener Gast der Familie zu sein blieb die 4 Tage,die ich dort war. Alle drei sind sehr locker und machen es sehr komfortabel,die Küche zu benutzen und zu kommen und gehen,als wäre ich wirklich ein Gast der Familie. Ich habe unsere Gespräche beim Kaffeetrinken als jeder sich bereit machte aus dem Haus zu gehen
El ambiente que encontré al llegar fue de bienvenida,y continuo los cuatro días que me aloje en esta casa familiar.  Todos fueron amables he hicieron mi estancia fácil,entrando y saliendo como si fuera una mas de la familia. Disfrute de nuestros encuentros matutinos y las conversaciones durante el cafe antes de empezar el día.,,,
La habitación y el lavabo eran confortables. La casa se encuentra a 5 minutos del metro y un cafe y otros 20 minutos para llegar hasta el centro de Boston.,,,,,

Their place was a short walk from the Green St. stop on the Orange Line near a gorgeous bike path/park. It's on the ground floor so there are no stairs. The neighbors are friendly and mostly older adults or young families. Their place is quiet, comfortable, safe, and very homey. The bedroom is comfortable and simple with an interesting book collection, towels, a locked door, a ceiling fan, and a super comfy bed.

Patti was very sweet and responsive in advance to my request for a hair dryer. She was busy cooking the co-housing community dinner that evening but made sure that her son was there to meet me when I arrived. Patti and Javier's home is inviting, the bed is very comfortable and, despite being close to the T, it was quiet at night. The neighborhood is perfect for me. With the T stop just a 3 minute walk and the Buddhist study program that I attend on Monday nights after work also a 5 minute walk away, I was able to take a welcome break from my long commute for an evening, leaving my car at work and then taking the T back in to work the next morning feeling relaxed and refreshed. I only wish that I had a little more time to chat with the family (they are early risers). I will be back for 2 more stays very soon!"

Days before we arrived, they let us know that they would be out of town and would have their neighbors greet us. The cohousing community where the home is situated offers a warm and welcoming sense of community. Their neighbors welcomed us and gave us some great tips for local eateries and places to shop. As soon as we settled in, there was a greeting letter and a list of several attractions. The room suited us well since we primarily needed a place to sleep and rest. When we did meet the family, they were friendly and gracious hosts. Because we were there for Marathon weekend, we were not sure if the T was going to be open early enough for us to get to shuttle. Javier graciously offered to drive us early in the morning. The check in/out times were flexible. Their home is close to everything within walking distance  that it was the perfect location for us. We will plan to stay with them again, perhaps for the next Boston marathon."

749247,27698328,2015-03-09,28704823,Gregory,"Patti and Javier were incredible hosts...very generous with their time and information (they printed out a very thorough packet with suggestions for tons of local restaurants and coffee shops) and even offered coffee and tea in the morning. The space was clean and neat and their vibe was so warm without feeling intrusive in any way. The room is in a great neighborhood (even in the snow) and because of Boston's excellent Subway system, it was very convenient for getting around the city."
749247,28438563,2015-03-23,29263059,Robert,"Patti and Javier's place was a wonderful experience. Excellent, quiet neighborhood, transit ready, and comfortable. We were away for most of the weekend, but the brief interactions shared with the family made us feel at ease as first time airbnb folk. Thanks again!"
749247,29188627,2015-04-05,7866528,Amanda,"I felt very comfortable returning to Patti and Javier's place. I hardly had time to chat with them compared to my last longer visit, and still we were able to have a good catch up. They host a lot and like meeting people and getting to know who you are. When I was about to leave for the airport without them being home to say goodbye Patti bounded out of a neighbour's place to give a hug goodbye. I'll definitely continue going back when I need a place in Boston."
749247,29368689,2015-04-06,12211707,Liam,"Patti and Javier were lovely, gracious hosts. My girlfriend and I wish we had more time to spend, but we popped in and out of town just for a one night wedding. The apartment is really easy to get to from the T, and it's part of a very cool co-housing community. We walked to a nice place for lunch and coffee. Accommodations are pleasant and simple, and they made a really delicious breakfast for us in the morning."
749247,29475640,2015-04-07,6308562,Carol,Wonderful couple to greet me after  driving over 400 miles that day. They even shared their dinner because I did not feel like going out yet again.  Comfortable bed and quiet neighborhood. My first experience with Airbnb and I was impressed.
749247,29873717,2015-04-13,30157148,Tiffany,The room and bath was a perfect fit for me! I was out seeing the town and visiting restaurants but for a place to freshen up and rest it was everything I needed and more. The bed was very comfortable and it was nice to have a private room! My first air bnb experience and I cannot wait to return to see Patti and Javier! Such warm hearted people with a warm and welcoming home!
749247,30002913,2015-04-15,2359725,Mathis,"The description of the location made it very easy for me to find the place, and Patti welcomed me in a very friendly way. Their home is an apartment in an interesting housing community building, with nice common spaces. The room is the former room of their daughter, and is perfectly comfortable. There is a little bit of noise from the road and the nearby T line, but it did not bother me (I slept very well). Javier allowed me to use his bike, which was absolutely great. In short, a great experience !"
749247,30491225,2015-04-23,25161510,Megan,"Our stay with Patti and Javier was everything we could have asked for and more!  It was our first time in Boston, first time using airbnb, and first time running the Boston marathon!  I have to admit that we were a little nervous, but once we got there and saw that their place was everything they advertised it to be, we felt immediately at home.  They were both extremely welcoming and helpful.  Patti left a very helpful note for us that described several restaurants and places within walking distance and information on using the T.  We really enjoyed our stay! Thank you Patti and Javier!"
749247,30801792,2015-04-27,20887026,Michelle,My friend and I were in Boston for the long weekend and our stay with Patti and Javier was wonderful! They're a really friendly couple and seem to really enjoy hosting.
The place is the perfect location for using the public transportation system,as walking to the T stop is quick,easy,and safe. They were so gracious to accommodate for our late arrival. Although they were not there for our entire stay,and even though we spent most of the days we were there out and about in the city,"they made us feel right at home. \""
749247,35250533,2015-06-16,34603979,Cindy,"We felt extremely welcome in Patti and Javier's home. In fact, I'm sorry that we didn't cross paths more in the two nights we were there. They and their son were lovely people."

749247,35828536,2015-06-22,4981292,Stephanie,"My boyfriend and I had an exhausting itinerary - flying in from LA on a red eye and leaving late on Sunday. Patti and Javier were very accommodating and gracious hosts. The room is very peaceful and breezy, it felt like we were staying at a beach house! It is very close to the T, less than 5 minutes from Sam Adams brewery, and walking distance to Centre street. We had such a great weekend in Boston thanks to Patti and Javier. Would highly recommend them and their lovely home!"

Patti,Javier,and their son are all very friendly and welcoming. They were full of information about local restaurants,things to do,where to go downtown,etc. We enjoyed chatting with each of them and wish we had more time socialize.
The place is a short walk from the Orange Line,maybe 3 minutes. It was very clean,had everything we needed,and we felt very welcome and at-home. There is a great collection of restaurants a short walk away,and a nice cafe is nearby for breakfast on the way into the city.,
The neighborhood itself is picturesque. Beautiful old houses,walking/biking trails,kids playing in parks,big old trees,a yoga class in the lush field next to the T station... what a wonderful place to live.,
Highly recommended,"and this will be our first choice next time we visit Boston.\"",,,,

They were extremely helpful with providing suggestions for fun things to do in the area and very easily reachable when we had any questions. Their home is so clean and was a very comfortable and enjoyable place to stay. Also they are located in a great location, just a short walk from a T stop and easy to get into the city."

It is also very convenient,as Downtown Boston is not far using the T subway  (around 15 minutes) or biking.,,,,
Great place and hosts,"we will definitely come again !\"",,,,
749247,75891678,2016-05-23,68417480,Yaning,Patti and Javier are Very kind and helpful. Location is good because it is near to the Orange line.
749247,76469244,2016-05-27,68648036,Be,"Javier welcomed us and Patti left a welcoming note.  Due to busy schedules,  we did not have a chance to meet Patti so notes exchange worked fine for communication."
The room is cosy but comfy with cross-ventilating windows and overhead fan.  The handy built-ins provide enough space for our laptop at a desk and shelves/hangers for our own stuff.  Orange 'T' is only a block away.  Street parking readily available,"a couple of times right in front of the entrance.\"",,,,
749247,76885119,2016-05-29,57301916,Kristine,Patti was kind enough to met us at the T stop and walk us back to her home!  We enjoyed visiting with Patti and Javier!  Patti was very helpful with recommendations and information on the area!  Enjoyed our stay!
749247,79223344,2016-06-12,15470917,Alex,"Patti met me at the door (getting there was easy thanks to the detailed directions) and showed me my room. They helpfully provided a short guide to the area including things to do and places to eat - after talking with Patti I took one of their recommendations and was led to a delicious sushi dinner just a short walk from their place. In the morning, we had coffee together and had a wonderful talk. The neighborhood is lovely, the room is quiet and well-appointed, and Patti and Javier were both very kind."
749247,80358385,2016-06-17,75302223,Annie,What a great experience! So glad we stayed with Patti and Javier. Such kind people & very helpful...our 1st Airbnb experience couldn't have been better without these two!

"The location is just perfect for first time travelers to Boston.  It's very easy to find and very close to \"\"T\"\" station",which could be troublesome for light sleepers as the noise by train could be heard during the operation hours,but it was not a problem for me at all.   :)  For people traveled with heavy luggage,this is the perfect place to chose,easy access from the airport,and room is on the ground floor
749247,83800324,2016-07-04,79381561,Imtiaz,It was a really good and relaxing experience. No problems what so ever. Very nice family who cares about your well being and has a beautiful home!
749247,84237153,2016-07-06,74459527,Alexandra,"We had a very enjoyable stay at Patti and Javier's house in Boston! It was our first time using Air BnB and we will definitely be doing so in future. They were welcoming, friendly and provided a helpful list of nearby restaurants and things to do in downtown Boston. The place was also located a five minute walk from the Orange line which was very helpful for getting downtown without a fuss. Finally, parking was very easy to find on the street outside the place. I would highly recommend staying with Patti and Javier on your next trip to Jamaica Plain!"
749247,85345559,2016-07-11,28801107,Simon,"The location was perfect for a couple of days in Boston - very close to the subway station, and a short commute to downtown. The family was nice and welcoming, even tough we only met Patti an hour before our departure. The overall impression was very positive and we would recommend staying with Patti and her family."

749247,89298229,2016-07-27,14773200,Tineke,We had a great stay here! Super clean and comfortable. Hosts are really friendly and gave some good tips for our Boston experience! Recommended!
749247,90583723,2016-08-01,81987836,Lin,"This is my first time using Airbnb and the whole experience was very delightful,thanks to Patti and Javier's wonderful hospitality."
My contact with Patti ahead of our travel was very smoothy and efficient. Upon our arrival,Patti welcomed us very friendly and showed us everything we need. She even prepared us with metro map and information about dining and exploring the city. She and Javier are both super nice and very easygoing people. Both my huasband and I felt relexed and happy staying with them. We enjoyed talking with them,like we were friends knowing each other for a long time.,,,
The room itself is not very spacious but meets our needs. We also have full access to the living room and kitchen which are cozy and lovely. Besides,the location is definitely a plus,with very convenient access to metro and in a low key but lovely neighborhood.,,,
We had a wonderful time staying with Patti and Javier,and highly recommend their home to other guests.,,,,

1458081,66187076,2016-03-20,57448849,Lee,"We had a great time during our trip to Boston. Bruno was very accommodating and easy to deal with throughout the whole process.  The location is perfect, a nice quiet neighbourhood but only 2 subway stops from downtown.  The condo was very clean, has all the amenities, and easily fit the 4 of us.  Being able to cook our own meals instead of eating out was a huge cost savings too."
There isn't any daytime street parking out front (2hr time limit mon-fri without a resident pass) so we had to park a few blocks away. But since we walked everywhere anyway this was a very minor inconvenience.,,,,,
All in all,"great place to stay in an awesome city. We would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,
1458081,68386307,2016-04-04,59651609,Sinead,"Bruno frequently contacted me before out visit to ensure the residence was were prepared for us. There was nothing I could complain about, everything was ready and more than appropriate for what we needed. The kids loved the white board wall as well as the space downstairs for they dance parties!!"
1458081,69014025,2016-04-08,28150452,Torryon,"Bruno was a great host. My family of 6 (myself, wife, sons (18 and 20, twin daughters 15). There was nothing we needed for in the home. We mostly hung out on the lower level playing games and watching movies. We stayed in one night and cooked. The spacious kitchen afforded for everyone to help. It was very spacious and well kept. Bathrooms were very clean and updated. The beds were extremely comfortable. Each room had TV with over the top content. This was our first time in Boston and he was very helpful in giving information for the area. The place was perfect. Very spacious and comfortable. Conveniently located close to downtown. I would definitely stay there again."
1458081,70640734,2016-04-19,43546500,Amy,"Indeed a gem! My family of 5 (myself, husband and 3 boys ages 6,6 and 7) and grandparents all stayed here for the Boston Marathon weekend. We did not rent a car and this location perfectly suited all our needs. The access to the T and the waterfront parks can't be beat. We really enjoyed getting to know the neighborhood. We didn't make it to Fenway, but caught a few innings of local high school and college games in the park on our way in and out."
The condo suited all our needs as well. It was very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed to be able to make a quick breakfast and enjoy a dinner. Bruno was a great host,"responding quickly to some \"\"user error\"\" issues. We'd definitely stay again when visiting Boston.\"",,,,
1458081,71416210,2016-04-25,28646351,Raoul,"A Boston Gem indeed, Bruno was a great host, any question I had was answered and taken care of fast.  The place we stayed at was great, roomy, and had wayyyyy more than we needed, Bruno sure likes to spoil their guests!  Definitely would recommend again and again, we even signed the guestbook which is a pretty cool idea."
1458081,72165731,2016-05-01,60403620,Patrick,The apartment was perfect and exactly what was described and exactly what the pictures were. This place has everything you needed in it like kitchen appliances and toiletries. It is in a perfect location with everything attraction in Boston being a 10 minute cab ride away. I would highly recommend this place and would 100% stay in this apartment again.
1458081,73348966,2016-05-08,45288635,Ketki,"The house was beautiful and was fully loaded with anything you would need for your stay. The location of the apartment is very convenient if you are here to explore Boston. If you're going to chill at home (which we had to, due to bad weather) there's a number of good little restaurants and takeout places around the place; also the house has a cozy basement that accommodates 8 people where you can sit and drink good wine and chitchat!"
Bruno was a great host. Very patient and understanding in answering any of my questions.,,,,,
P.S - this home also comes with a great collection of books,"if you have time you can sit back and enjoy one of those! \"",,,,

1458081,75613194,2016-05-22,57517447,Lynette,Bruno was a terrific host. He kept in total contact with us from the time we booked his apartment until after we arrived home. It was a very great stay. This place was a 5-10 minute walk from the subway and the airport. The old school feel of Boston was really pronounced in this place with the exposed brick walls.  Very spacious rooms that will comfortably sleep eight people. The kitchen had everything you could possibly need.  Small market half block down the street for basic food needs.  We also found a wonderful restaurant called ECCO within 5 block walking distance. There is also pizza within 4 blocks.  Would stay here again without a doubt!
1458081,76507503,2016-05-27,34613892,Debra,"We loved our stay in Boston!  The condo was very convenient to access all we wanted to do.  Just a few minutes walk to the T,  a car wasn't necessary after we arrived.  The condo was roomy, and Bruno had provided extra toiletries (even toothbrushes!) in the bathrooms. We stayed gone most of the day, then in the evenings we sat downstairs and played games or watched TV.  There was a market just down the street as well.  If you drive, be sure and ask about parking- it is available on the street but some spaces have a  2 hour limit and there are times when the street-cleaners come that you will need to move your car to avoid a ticket.  But Bruno was responsive and helpful and let us know where unlimited parking was available close by.  All in all, the condo was a good match for us, and we would stay there again."
1458081,77260391,2016-05-31,14058198,Puneet,"Bruno reached out after confirming the booking as well as 5 days before our check in date. Provided a lot of detail and came across as very easy going, making us feel very relaxed. The apartment condition was nice and it was well maintained overall. However few things we would like to note so that it benefits all people looking to stay there in future:"
1. On our 2nd night we had an issue where we heard screams of a woman begging for mercy and eventually cop car sirens were heard. Following that we felt like we heard metal clanging and couldn't tell if someone was trying to break in from the backyard. Needless to say,it was a very scary experience. To this point,I have to say that Bruno was great,when I called him in the morning he was very understanding and offered to refund a significant portion of the rental charges. He also did his due diligence by following up with the cops.,,
2. The pictures in the airbnb posting can be misleading with the views of the park and the skyline,we had no such view from the apartment,,,,
3. The stairs to the basement are very steep and narrow. One needs to be careful as this may be a major inconvenience if you are planning on travel with old parents or young kids,,,,,
Regarding the incident,I do want to note that this is not something Bruno could control and he did his best for us given the circumstances. Also,the apartment condition was very good overall. This is why we are giving an overall rating of 4. However,the neighborhood did seem a bit scary,so I would enourage travelers to do their research on the east boston area before hand and make sure they feel comfortable,
"\"",,,,,
1458081,77900968,2016-06-04,6531137,Sue & Jim,Bruno was in constant touch with me before the trip as well as after we arrived.  We had a wonderful time. Easy walk to the metro. Able to go to all parts  of Boston using public transportation. Bruno made some suggestions of local restaurants and his suggestions are great. Don't miss Italian Express Pizza. Large groups need to make reservations.  House was comfortable and met all our lodging needs.
1458081,78739680,2016-06-08,11541101,Angeli,"This is a terrific family apartment with easy access to Logan and all the places you want to visit in Boston via the T. We had two adults and two teenagers and everyone loved it. Bruno is also a great host - detailed info on his apartment page, quick to respond to messages and he has thought of everything you'll need during the stay. Highly recommend staying here!"
1458081,79712047,2016-06-13,51699131,Jason,The host kept in communication prior to and during our stay to ensure everything was ok and if we needed anything.
The host also refunded me the fee to upgrade from 4 to 6 people because 2 friends were unable to make it due to a last second personal situation.,,,,,
The listing was accurate other than the lack of cable. When the trip was booked,listing said there was cable TV. There was not cable 5 months later. But there was FireTV.,,,,
The neighborhood was a little rundown but was safe and the people were nice. Very close to the train station was a huge plus getting around Boston.,,,,,
Good stay overall!  Thank you,"Bruno. \"",,,,
1458081,80677468,2016-06-19,44025301,Ande,"Bruno was an excellent host! I would absolutely recommend this place to my friends or loved ones. He communicated quickly and efficiently the entire time leading up to my trip, as well as during to check in and make sure everything was going wonderfully. I was amazed at the beautiful home. Pictures don't do it justice. Furthermore, the location was perfect. Close to public transportation and close enough to take an uber anywhere in the city for low/reasonable cost. The trip couldn't have gone better. We had everything we needed, and enjoyed the stay. Will NEVER stay in a hotel again after this experience. Thanks Bruno! Everyone else, do yourself a favor and book this right away, you won't regret it."
1458081,82802991,2016-06-29,63876488,Melanie,Bruno was a fantastic host.  He stayed in contact with us from the beginning.  He continued to check up on us during our stay to make sure things were going well.  The location was great!  It was easy to get to and from the airport and was a short walk to the T.  To be able to be downtown Boston in 10 minutes was perfect! We found the best Italian restaurant ( Italian Express) just a few short blocks from his apartment.

1458081,84145544,2016-07-05,28243613,Charlotte,"Bruno's apartment was fantastic and quite large for the usual Boston places. I stayed with 6 other people and there was plenty of room for all, including two stories. He provided coffee, tea, cooking tools, and filtered water which came in handy. Bonus points for the hair dryer :) The location is in East Boston and pretty close to a lot. It only takes a few short minutes by car to get to downtown Boston."
My friends and I went to a breakfast/lunch place around the corner called La Hacienda. It was absolutely fantastic and super cheap. Definitely a must try if you're into Latin food. If I'm ever back in town with a large group,"I'll definitely use Bruno!\"",,,,
1458081,85990737,2016-07-14,64553526,Christopher,"Bruno was a terrific host. We had 6 people & the condo had all we needed. It was very helpful to have the washer/dryer. The coffee K-cup and filtered water was great too. Location to Airport Subway stop & rental car facility was excellent. Neighborhood appears to be in transition (improving). If you use the Maverick station Subway stop, you'll want to keep an eye out. We didn't have any problems, but we kept good situational awareness at all times. I'd recommend sticking with the Airport Subway stop. The stairs to get downstairs could present a challenge for some. We were fine as we're all very active, but they stairs are spiral and tight. Italian Express (chat with Jim the owner) is a must for dinner. it's only a couple of blocks from the condo. We'd definitely stay here again. For the price and location, this is an excellent value. We stayed here and traveled in/out of Boston on the Subway and bought a 7-day pass. It was well worth it and it was great value. Also, the GOBoston Card was a great value too. Find it online. We used it for several activities in Boston, Plymouth Plantation and Cape Code. We bought the 7-day pass and it paid for itself after the 3rd day. We had a great visit to Boston and enjoyed our stay at Bruno's condo."
1458081,87163907,2016-07-18,14990428,Justin,"We loved staying at Bruno's apartment in Boston! The place was very clean and had a lot of space, although if you can't handle steep stairs this place may not be for you (the lower level is awesome but you have to walk down a difficult to navigate spiral staircase). Overall we loved the apartment and very close to public transit and the airport."
1458081,87779643,2016-07-21,62985191,Kevin,The place was very nice. When we arrived there was a little problem but Bruno quickly corrected it and from then on everything was perfect. Great 4 bedroom 2 bath apartment. It was clean well kept. Nice place to just relax in. Very easy to get to downtown Boston from there. Would highly recommend it. If I'm ever in Boston again I would love to stay there again.

1458081,88464536,2016-07-24,63548432,Ryan,Bruno was great and very responsive to my questions and requests.  He also responded in short order when I had a question.  The place itself was nice and was extremely convenient as most places we visited were only a short uber ride or train ride which helped us save on costs while we were visiting the city.  I would certainly stay here again with a group of people when traveling.

Also convenient access to the subway stop and free street parking as a bonus."
1458081,93457624,2016-08-12,59244751,Lisa,Bruno's place was great; just as described! A nice place to stay for a party of 8 with all the amenities of home. The house was very clean. The neighborhood is safe and in a great location to catch the bus or subway in 10 minutes or less for easy transportation around Boston. Bruno was a pleasure to work with and I would recommend staying here.
1458081,94435481,2016-08-15,85217019,Lina,Awesome experience! My family had a great time at Bruno's place!
1458081,99897033,2016-09-06,75578695,Lars,"This is a fantastic location in a beautiful city! Bruno's home was very clean, convenient and certainly made for a comfortable, safe and wonderful experience in Boston. I would stay at this location again and would recommended to anyone looking to visit Boston."
12824498,74215183,2016-05-14,68305082,Cory,When we stayed Isaac was out of town but his roommate Aaron was very hospitable and helpful in getting us situated and acquainted with the area of the city. The location was extremely convenient for heading into Boston or exploring the surrounding Jamaica Plan area. Their apartment is very close to the pond and I enjoyed a morning jog around it. The walk to the T station was very reasonable and a Whole Foods is very close as well. Aaron was very easy going and offered us use of much of the apartment even though we mostly came and went throughout the day. Overall an excellent experience for the price and I would highly recommend to anyone.
12824498,76444607,2016-05-27,6398530,Gen,"We enjoyed our stay, the T is close as well as some good local restaurants (Sorellas, yum!). Aaron was welcoming and flexible with arrival/departure times which was nice.  Good value, we recommend this listing :)."
12824498,85644805,2016-07-12,76615932,Miya,Isaac's place is in a great location to bus up to MFA Boston and Isabella Stewart Gardner Museums (and MassArt is along the way.) The #39 bus is frequent and reliable and gets you downtown in 20 minutes.
Jamaica Plains is a walkable neighborhood full of places to eat (Orientale de Cuba was a favorite) and even a Whole Foods nearby if you need to grab something quick. Olmsted Park is just down the block.,,,,,
"Isaac was not there but his 2 sociable roommates were helpful. \"",,,,,
12824498,92613980,2016-08-09,73918010,Larissa,His housmate Aaron welcomed us very friendly. The flat is really pretty.
We have been in downtown Boston in about 25 min. By T.,,,,,
"In 2 min. There is a park for relaxing and jogging. Thanks for the great stay!\"",,,,,
10056496,58475487,2016-01-02,18891230,Paige,"Andy was a great host. We had many friends over to stay for New Years Eve and we all had a blast! Super close to the T to head to the city. Lots of bedrooms, we all slept comfortably. Everything was in order and very neat. I highly recommend! Thanks Andy!"
10056496,64844178,2016-03-08,58079752,Chris,"my guests and i had a very nice , quiet stay. all rooms and bathrooms are very clean. we would def stay here again."
10056496,66271029,2016-03-20,28370915,Angelica,This house is in a great spot if you are willing to take a quick subway ride into Boston
10056496,67600488,2016-03-30,49279803,Jon,"Andy did a great job preparing the place for us. After simply asking about towels he took the extra effort to have one ready in each room. The location was convenient, and the house was tidy.  Looking for a house? go for Andy."
10056496,68478743,2016-04-05,28240926,George,"Andy's place was very clean and spacious. Location was nice, and very close to the T. Andy was very quick to respond to any questions I had about the house and the location. I would definitely recommend this location if you're travelling with a group of friends!"
10056496,69517429,2016-04-11,52111798,Fang,"房子不错,临近地铁,去哪儿都方便。房东人也不错,不过没有见面,只是电话联系了。房子里的设施也都不错。"
10056496,70646551,2016-04-19,2491956,Owain,The apartment was great and ideal for a group visiting Boston. IT is very close to the T station which makes it easy to get into the city with regular trains. Andy was very accommodating. The apartment was super clean with 2 en-suites. Would stay again.
10056496,71015904,2016-04-22,58858835,Karyn,This property was exactly as described in the listing. A very short and easy walk to the blue line T station gave us easy access to the city. There are shops and restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood felt very safe and we had no concerns being out after dark with our small children. The home was clean and the perfect size for our group of 4 adults and 2 children.
10056496,73185551,2016-05-07,55918009,Igor,Andy's house was nice and clean house. His house is our recommendation to every ones that want to travel to Boston.
10056496,74461022,2016-05-15,53915628,Marcus,Andy's house was clean and tidy. The images correspond with reality. Can recommend his house to others. Close to subway.
10056496,74881752,2016-05-17,67453449,Susan,Great space and a very good location. Can leave your car overnight at the T stop nearby. A clean space that's good for a group. Andy was a great host.
10056496,76122940,2016-05-24,52163535,Jerri,"The neighborhood was very nice.  The apt #1 was very clean.  Nice 4 bedrooms and 3 baths. The only thing we found wrong was the showers need shower curtains so water does not go all over the floor.  The tv cable needs updated. Could only get a few channels.  Might consider putting tvs in the bedrooms for future families.  May consider putting additional chairs . Other than that , I would recommend ."
10056496,76659993,2016-05-28,14275805,Kelly,"Great location for our large group. Felt like a safe area and our children enjoyed the nearby beach/park. Having the kitchen and laundry facilities was a great help to us. Andy was very prompt in his reply to all our questions. Might could use some fans in the bedrooms to circulate the air as it's getting warmer for summer, we are used to having AC. Wifi could be stronger but that goes for any hotel. Enjoyed it, great location and host!"
10056496,77123782,2016-05-30,13245411,Geraldine,Andy's place is exactly how it's described and shown on the pictures. Andy was great host and always responded quickly when we had questions. It's a great space for a group.
10056496,77921561,2016-06-04,57181424,Mengyuan,"the apartment was located in the lower level of the house, four bedrooms and three bathrooms. Though we didn't see Andy during the stay, the apartment was clean, comfortable and easy to check in and check out."
"\"",,,,,
10056496,78861285,2016-06-09,27558361,Yolanda,"The area was great, near the metro.  We expected the intire house but was only a section of the home.  Check in was easy."
10056496,80087077,2016-06-16,63803128,Baohui,"We like Andy's house very much. The landlord is very kind and nice. He replies quickly to our question information. The information provided by the landlord is trustworthy and reliable.This house has four rooms, the room is quite spacious, there are two rooms with the restroom, that is very convenient."
10056496,80325664,2016-06-17,60106634,Valerie,"Check-in was very easy. Neighborhood was very convenient for getting to Downtown Boston quickly and easily, with public transportation within a few minutes walk.  Only about a 15-20 minute ride on the t into Downtown Boston.  Spacious sleeping areas."
10056496,80770732,2016-06-19,38272915,Chase,We had a great time in Boston and Andy's spot was in a great location. Easy access to the airport and only a few minute drive downtown. Andy was great at getting us checked in and answering questions prior to our visit.
10056496,81760512,2016-06-24,53976972,Martin,"Apartment on lower level, but it was clean and all 8 of us slept great. No one seemed home upstairs. Two in-room bathrooms were a nice surprise. Bring your own soap, but seems to be an Airbnb norm. Not enough chairs, but it wasn't a prime necessity for us. Washer (pay) and dryer, but didn't need them. Great location - quick time to airport and into town as promised by Andy. We didn't see him, but responded very quickly to all questions."
10056496,82190602,2016-06-26,70223981,John,the neighborhood was as described. convenient to the T station. parking on the street was available.
10056496,82966441,2016-06-30,48363967,Ashley,"Our AirBnB experience began with a man coming out of the apartment we had paid for and reserved carrying laundry. He was told by Andy that he could use the facilities. This was very off putting . When we came into the apartment we noticed that there were no washcloths. Andy was notified and quickly delivered hand towels the next day. We received one towel (stained and smelly)per person for the duration of our trip (4 days). There is a washer/dryer in the unit but you have to pay to dry your items (bring your own detergent). When we arrived, the dirty towels from a previous tenant were cascading over the washer- disgusting. There is no soap at the sinks in the kitchen or bathrooms so be prepared to buy your own. Also there is only one roll of toilet paper per bathroom so be forewarned."
After a quick inventory of the apartment we realized that it was equipped with 3 chairs and a love seat. One of these chairs was broken and was held together with a shoelace. Since this property was advertised as something that accommodated 8 people we were very shocked and disappointed to find that this was not so. In the kitchen there is 1 glass,4 forks,5 spoons and 1 knife. Again,this would not even accommodate a group of 4 more or less 8. We traveled as a group of 6 so we were unable to cook/share a meal together or gather together in the living room. 2 people sat on the floor.,,
This apartment has no central AC. There are fans in every room and even with the windows open the temperature remained at a balmy 80 degrees. There is very limited parking in front of the apartment. All of the spaces are labeled resident only permit parking and there were no accommodations made for us renting the space.,,,,,
"The bottom unit is quite noisy when there are tenants above. It is also noisy due to the proximity to the airport. Bring ear plugs! \"",,,,,
10056496,83966035,2016-07-04,69355156,Katherine,"There are 2 units at this location. Unit 1 is not pictured - it is a garden level apartment with 4 bedrooms and either double or queen size beds.  There were only 2 wood chairs and a love seat in the tiny TV/living area. Kitchen did not have silverware cups bowls or plates. Minimal pots, pans and cooking utensils No cutting board etc. No coffee maker. It would have been nice to even have had a small coffeemaker. Luckily Starbucks is a 5 - 10 min walk away. BYO dish and hand soap, laundry soap and quarters for the dryer. BYO toilet paper if you need a second roll. If the upper unit has a child who likes to run up and down the hall, you will hear every footstep at 6 am or at 4 am. BYO earplugs"
Make sure the host,Andy,gives you the lockbox combo before you get there. It was the only time he was unresponsive - it took over 2 hr to get into the unit. Almost all other questions I had were answered within 30 min. Andy did allow 4 of our party to park their bags and hang out upstairs after check out time to wait for their airplane. The downstairs unit had to be cleaned for the next guests.,,,
Bedroom decor is nicely Zen except no chairs for the desks. Great hot water supply in the showers. Excellent. We had enough towels,but other reviewers evidently had problems. If you have a problem with towels,call him. Our towels and hand towels were clean and fresh.,,,
No parking during business days from 8-6 is a problem. I got a $40 ticket...missed moving the car by 45 min. I actually parked at the Orient Heights Blue Line T (not easy to find parking area on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)) and went to harbor. Fast and easy once you find the parking area.,,,,,
Mattresses are firm and ok but not super comfy. BYO pillow if you are particular.,,,,,
NO AIR CONDITIONING. lots of fans. However,being a garden level apartment without a lot of cross-ventilation,it was very stuffy and made for poor sleeping conditions on 2 of the 4 nights which were very hot and humid.,,,
There is a Shaw's supermarket a convoluted 10 min drive away that has window AC units for about $130...I almost bought one.,,,,,
Lots of closet space and hangers.,,,,,
Almost no drawers in any of the bedrooms.,,,,,
"Fast wifi; good cable tv selection - we could get tour de france but not the European soccer games - had to go to Cheers in Quincy Market for that\"",,,,,
10056496,86453379,2016-07-16,10882392,Cyril,Great location. Close to T subway
10 mins from central Boston.,,,,,
"Great local breakfast in Angelas close to Orient Heights station\"",,,,,
10056496,88592492,2016-07-24,24602737,Syla,"Andy's place is nice and neat place. The four bedrooms are a good size and the bathrooms are newly renovated which i like, it was clean.  Although the place doesn't have air conditioning, a fan is provided for each room. Andy is a very good host and responds to our needs right away. His place is a walking distance to the metro station which is really convenient. The only thing is you can't leave your car in front of the house from 8 am - 6 pm as it is only for the residents, you might get a ticket. If you have to take the train or bus you have to park it at the metro parking lot which is $5 all day, not bad. We will"
"definitely go back to his place next time. \"",,,,,
10056496,89465033,2016-07-28,41009647,Chen,"The apartment we rent is in the half-basement of a three-family house, located in a not-so-good, difficult-to-find neighborhood, which nonetheless is convenient to the airport and subway (walking distance of 10 minutes)."
There is a nice backyard with sloping woods extending downhill.,,,,,
The apartment is in clean but spartan condition. There are four very simple bedrooms and three dorm-style bathrooms,which will accommodate up to eight people. But the kitchen is large enough to hold 2-3 people at most with a small table that seats 2. There is also the infamous chair whose leg is held by a shoe-lace.,,,,
The Wifi signal is weak and there is little or no signal in some of the rooms. Thanks to the basement location,it is difficult to receive carrier signal as well.,,,,
The attached laundry room is dirty and littered with dirty linens,making it difficult to use the coin-operated washer and dryer.,,,,
What makes it worst is the lack of A/C units. It did not help that our visit coincided with some of the hottest days in Boston,when mid-day temperature reached 103. We had four big floor fans inside,but they were as loud as the propeller of the piston-engine planes.,,,
But then there is value: the $288/day rate translates to $41 per person,or less than $40 if rented by a gang of eight. If you are traveling on a tight budget,"then this may not be a bad choice.\"",,,
10056496,90681574,2016-08-01,66773428,Johanna,"Listing is accurate and it's incredibly easy to get to the house from the T. Thanks so much for our stay! It was clean, painless, and awesome."
10056496,91162342,2016-08-04,7731778,Frances,"这是我在airbnb定过的性价比最高的房子,特别适合2-3个家庭入住,床和卫生间很多,私密性很好。实用简单干净。唯一不太方便就是停车,刚开始因为搞不清当地规定,搞得我们非常紧张,如果能把停车细节说更清楚些就最棒了。"
10056496,91714588,2016-08-06,21754934,Johannes,"We had a nice stay at Andy's apartment. The communication with Andy was easy as he answered quickly. The Metro Station is quite near, so you are about 15 minutes in central Boston. Thanks."
10056496,93114750,2016-08-11,67942559,Sylvaine,The rusting old washing machine sitting at the entrance to the basement Appartment was not a very nice way to welcome us. The garden is a dump and really needs to be cleaned up. Towels were fresh. Some bed had stained sheets. Overall the Appartment was clean.
10056496,95245219,2016-08-19,456876,Ramon,"Recomiendo este piso. La localización del apartamento está bien. Cerca hay una estación que permite estar en el centro fácilmente. También está muy cerca del aeropuerto. Teniendo en cuenta que éramos un grupo grande, echamos de menos un espacio común y una mesa para cenar todos juntos. El resto bien. No coincidimos con el anfitrión pero dejo las llaves en una caja con código por lo que fue muy sencillo llegar sin necesidad de concretar hora."
"I recommend this place. Location was good with a station close to reach the city center easily. Airport is close as well. Considering we were a big group we missed a living room and a table to have dinner together. We did not meet the host but he left the keys in a box with code so it was very easy to get them without agreeing in a arrival time.\"",,,,,
10056496,96062095,2016-08-21,1896375,Ewa,"This wasn't the best of my airbnb experiences. I love airbnb for the ability to stay in unique places that have a personal touch and this apartment doesn't offer that at all unfortunately. It's clean, but very basic, with not enough communal space or even kitchen tableware to host the number of people it is advertised for. It's very basic and sterile. If you want just a place to sleep with no character close to the airport, it might be a place for you, but if you're searching for something more personal and with character - try someplace else. Plus, on the last night there was a party upstairs with people dancing, which felt like the ceiling was going to come down. Luckily, communication with Andy was very good and he quickly resolved the problem by asking the neighbours to quiet it down."
69369,276153,2011-05-23,473539,Megan,I had a very pleasant stay in Boston. Michelle is a wonderful host and very considerate and generous. The bed was warm and comfortable and  the breakfast provided was great.
69369,286318,2011-05-29,535817,Ruth,"Michelle went out of her way to make our visit to Boston as interesting, and enjoyable as possible. Our room was clean and comfortable, and we slept well. Her homemade breakfasts were absolutely delicious. We had some great discussions over her homemade granola about the local area, Boston, USA and life! Thanks for a memorable stay, Michelle, in a great city."
69369,338249,2011-06-27,695611,Marie,"Michelle is a great great hostess. She came to the T station to show me the way to her home. Her house has a lot of character, the rooms are very cosy and the bathroom is beautiful. She likes to chat, especially in French, and she is always here to explain many things about Boston's history. I went with her to the restaurant and to an explosive barbecue... I really had a good time in Boston, thanks to Michelle."
69369,346694,2011-07-01,668276,Matthew,"Michelle is a wonderful, kind and considerate person. Her home is beautiful and the room was clean and quiet. We were in town to look for a place to live, and within 20minutes of being in the house, Michelle took us to a place in the area that was up for rent. She had wonderful coffee ready in the morning, and there were lots of cereals for breakfast. We could park on the street opposite the house with little problem."
We also had full freedom from Michelle to come and go as we needed to,which was important as we were running all over town looking at apartments and weren't sure of our schedule hour to hour. She gave us a key and was understanding about our arrival and departure times,,,,
My only questions at the end of the experience had more to do with the area. Roxbury is full of amazing homes,but is also adjacent to some more questionable parts of the city. There is a lack of consistency to the area that made us question how safe things were from block to block. On our last night there was a rowdy party across the street that resulted in insults being thrown at my wife and fireworks being set off endlessly,along with screaming and vomiting.,,,
Michelle has NO control over those things,however. And maybe Im just too uptight. But the area ended up being outside of my own comfort-zone,safety-wise.,,,
"\"",,,,,
69369,405840,2011-07-30,553720,Matthew,"Michelle was the consummate host.  Before I arrived, she answered every question, no matter how trivial, quickly and with humor.  The room was comfortable, the neighborhood close to central Boston and the Longwood area in particular (where I was taking classes at Harvard School of Public Health), plus Brookline and the South End neighborhoods (like Roxbury).  I stayed at Michelle's for almost a month, but she was flexible with my schedule as I had to return on weekends to see family in northern New England.  The close proximity of the Orange Line and the Silver Line made getting to North or South Stations simple.  Michelle was also an enthusiastic tour guide and set out simple yet fantastic breakfasts every morning.  It was a wonderful stay by any measure--even with a busy month of grueling classes!"
69369,483185,2011-08-29,530837,Amélie,"Nous avons passer une semaine chez Michelle et ce fut notre coup de coeur du voyage. Son hospitalité est indéniable. Je vous recommande fortement les deux chambres que Michelle offre à Boston, vous ne serez pas déçu!"
We spend a full week with Michelle and it was our favorite of the trip. His hospitality is undeniable. I highly recommend the two rooms that Michelle offer in Boston,"you will not be disappointed!\"",,,,
69369,502314,2011-09-05,874098,Andy,"Michelle was a great host. Welcoming, informative and a great cook too! A little out of town from the main attractions of Boston but this didnt stop us doing everything we intended to do. A short walk from the subway or a $15 taxi ride from Back Bay. Would definately stay again and her homemade blueberry muffins were THE best start to the day!"
69369,512743,2011-09-08,587095,Barbara,Our host made us feel very welcomed. Michelle gave us very helpful advice with regards transport and sightseeing ideas in downtown Boston. Her place has a homely feel. We would recommend her to others and stay again if in Boston.
69369,561923,2011-09-24,880722,Chris,"Michelle has a lovely house and is an excellent host. I would highly recommend her if you're new to the city, and would like tips on where to go and what to see. The house is a short walk (10 minutes or so) from the T, and the neighbourhood seems quiet and pleasant."
69369,588251,2011-10-02,693049,Zimei,"she is so nice. although at the first day we had some problems. but Michelle solved those problems quickly. and in the later days, she gave us some help. thanks a lot."
69369,654818,2011-10-23,865095,Brad,"Michelle is a wonderful host.  She was very accommodating throughout my stay in Boston.  I want to give specific feedback for the different aspects of my stay below.  All of these points apply to my stay, so YMMV."
Bedroom:,,,,,
The room is very comfortable,with a nice bed,new linens,and a down comforter.  Two windows looking east out the second story of the house.  Two lamps provide adequate light at night,and there's a ceiling fan.  This is a nice room for a longer stay (mine was 3 weeks).,
Bathroom:,,,,,
Shared between you,Michelle,and (potentially) another guest.  Nice facilities,room for your stuff,etc.  Michelle cleans the bathroom at least weekly and it was always spotless and very inviting.  The shower is hot and the water pressure is good.,
Living room:,,,,,
Shared space,inviting with a leather chair and nice sofa.  No TV but a very inviting place.,,,,
Kitchen:,,,,,
Well-equipped,functional kitchen that you can actually use for cooking.  No microwave and no dishwasher,FWIW.  Michelle made space for me in her pantry and fridge.  Plenty of pots,pans,utensils,etc.  Gas range and gas oven.  Basically everything you could ask for.  You have to do your dishes
Breakfast:,,,,,
Part of the deal is that Michelle will provide breakfast for your stay.  For me,since I was leaving before 7am for work,this meant that she provided coffee (whole bean,with a grinder,pour-over not drip,delicious) and homemade cereal bars.  The food was always delicious and I really appreciated that she worked with my schedule to make sure I had things to eat in the morning.  This was definitely above-and-beyond what I expected.
Location:,,,,,
25 minute walk to Children's Hospital.  10 minute walk to Roxbury Crossing.  5 minute walk to Dudley Station.  Plenty of transit connections,but all require some walking.,,,,
Host:,,,,,
Do not underestimate the importance of a good host if you are looking to rent a room instead of an entire apartment.  Michelle was thoughtful,helpful,and knowledgeable about the area.  She was very generous throughout my stay,made a stop at Trader Joe's once for me,gave me a ride to the airport on my last day,let me borrow her laundry detergent
Safety:,,,,,
Roxbury gets a bad rap,and that's really not appropriate.  As a single 26yo male,I never felt unsafe in the neighborhood,even walking around late at night by myself.  You're in a city,so be aware of your surroundings and you should be fine.  I was for three weeks.,
Overall:,,,,,
5* for the room and hospitality.  As long as the location is ok with you,"there's no reason not to stay here.  I had a wonderful time.  Thanks Michelle!\"",,,,
69369,682871,2011-11-01,1292192,Khalid,I can't speak highly enough of my brief stay at Michelle's home.  She was a very kind and gracious host.  I would not hesitate to stay there again in the future.
"\"",,,,,
69369,716500,2011-11-14,1268089,Christine,An academic program brought me to Boston for 5 nights.  This was my first time in Boston and my first experience with airbnb; both of them were fabulous!
My bed was comfortable,the sheets were warm (it was heading into winter when I stayed) and the environment was charming and welcoming. (Oh,I should also mention clean.  It was CLEAN!!)  Being a little geeky and internet-addicted,the WiFi in the house was a welcome perk.,,
The communication with Michelle was PERFECT -- never too much never too little information.  She provided excellent directions on how to take public transportation from the airport ( it was easy peas-y) and met me at the train station.  She's a native Bostonian and a delightful conversationalist.   As we walked to her home,she pointed out local points of interest that also served as visual points of reference,when I returned to the train station on my own the next morning.  She provided maps and public transportation info,answered questions and offered (really good) suggestions of things to do outside of my class time:  she effectively set me up to experience her city independently.  (Yay!),,
That she woke up and made coffee and offered me homemade baked goods and delicious granola every morning was over-the-top graciousness.  (My classmates were completely jealous of my housing situation),,,,,
Should I ever find myself back in Boston,"I hope I'm able to stay with Michelle again.  She's a natural host and her home was perfect for me.\"",,,,
69369,967606,2012-03-03,1304854,Ben,Michelle was awesome! The room was fantastic and her generously provided breakfast was exactly what's lacking in hotels/other Airbnb arrangements. Will be staying again soon!
69369,986641,2012-03-10,1304854,Ben,Second time staying with Michelle. Still awesome!
69369,1004714,2012-03-15,1304854,Ben,Michelle continues to be a fantastic host.

The breakfast was awesome as well and she bakes great morning cereal bars!!,,,,,
The bed was very comfortable and the room receives a fairly good amount of sun light.,,,,,

69369,1069949,2012-04-01,1991787,Martino,"I went to michelle's house only three days. This is a short time but it is enough to understand that Boston is a beautiful city and that the house  is a real typical house in Boston. It s beautiful, it's cozy and it's interesting. I loved it. Michelle is very very welcoming and kind. Available to help you and let you enjoy your experience leaving your space. Thank you Michelle."
69369,1104660,2012-04-10,1392372,Ian (& Hannah),"Michelle was an awesome host, very helpful prior to our arrival and greeted us with a warm smile and lots of information should we have required it."
The room was an ideal size with plenty of space for clothing and more than enough room to move.  The bathroom was clean and tidy and there was plenty of hot water in the shower.,,,,,
Michelle was kind enough to bake granola bar and muffins for us so there was food,tea and coffee in the kitchen when we eventually arose from the comfortable bed!,,,,
Michelle's place is located c.10 minute walk from Roxbury Crossing which in turn is probably 15 minutes from the heart of downtown,all in all the location was good and transport links were easy to navigate.,,,,

69369,1267673,2012-05-12,2218813,Andrew,"Just as advertised - great host, nice house in a quiet area about 10 mins walk from the MBTA.  Thanks!"
I arrived on the MBTA from the airport,took about 30 mins from airport station and Michelle met me.  On the way back,my flight was early so MIchelle kindly booked a taxi for me.  It was about $20 and took about 15 mins,although that will depend on traffic.,,
One general Boston tip - if you're there for more than a day,"get the 7 day MBTA pass.  At $15 it's the cheapest option if you're likely to take more than seven round trips.\"",,,,

Michelle was helpful and friendly from the point we made the reservation the whole time until we left her place. She even picked us up at the T station on our arrival.
Michelle provided so many useful tips and prepared awesome granola and baked goods for us. We were always allowed to help ourselves to everything in her kitchen,so we could have various teas and of course her delicious granola in the morning.,,,,
The room itself was as described. We also liked the location of the place as the bus and T stations are quite near. For a place in a city it's also quiet.,,,,,

The description of the room and neighborhood is very precise and she provide a lot of information about Boston.

60029,161726,2011-01-01,315117,Nath,"Staying in the house of Michelle was really great!! She is a wonderful host!! very careful of a guest needs, whenever I needed something & asked her, Michelle helped me in having it, thanks Michelle!"
A warm and comfortable place (with a very comfortable bed!),very convenient and very close to all the places I wanted to go while staying in Boston. Michelle can provide you with a lot of advices about what you can do,where to go (cafe',bars,restaurants,arts entertainments
Plus,I enjoyed very healthy organic & natural breakfasts :) yummy!,,,,
A place I will for sure recommend to my friends planning a trip to Boston!,,,,,

60029,166295,2011-01-05,262833,Javier,"Our stay in Michelle's place was really nice. Michelle is just a wonderful host, when we arrived to Boston, she was waiting for us at the metro station. And then, on our way to her house, she gave us a nice explanation about the neighborhood, restaurants, pubs, etc."
As it was our first visit to Boston,we didn't have a clear plan for visiting the city,but Michelle advised us where to go. She even cooked some extraordinary blueberry muffins for breakfast!,,,
Also,she gave us a ride to the bus station the day we left,that was so helpful for us.,,,
The room is really good,with a big and comfortable bed. The rest of the house is beautiful too. In short,our experience in Boston was great.,,,
"Thanks a lot Michelle!!\"",,,,,
60029,168181,2011-01-08,257098,Ana,"We spent a night at Michelle's place. Her place is not very easily accessible to public transportation. Fortunately she greeted us at the station, otherwise it would have been quite difficult to find her place. The route to her place is not straight forward and it is UP THE HILL. The town of Roxbury is not very efficient in snow removal and it's policies. Many of the residents did not shovel the snow on the sidewalks, and we had to walk on the road which is very dangerous, particularly in winter. After we reached her home there were many stairs to climb. So, be prepared!"
The distances mentioned in the ad are erroneous. To reach the T-stop alone,it takes 20 minutes. MFA is at least another 20 minutes from there. And LMA is about 15 more minutes. If you are a marathon runner you can make it in the times that are posted. Otherwise not!,,,,
The apt.ment is shared by another gentleman which was not  known to us since it was not disclosed in the ad.,,,,,
The house is nice,but very old. One interesting feature [I have never seen it anywhere else!] is that the bathroom sink has 2 separate faucets on the 2 corners of the sink. One produces very cold water,and the other initially cold and then warm/hot water. There is no mixing of the cold and hot water. Michelle also mentioned that the shower takes a while to get to the right temperature and you have to be patient.,,,
Unfortunately,the host forgot to turn the heater on in the room and it was very cold and the window was drafty. She also did not change the bed linens. I could not fall asleep until about 4AM. She told us that we will have to leave with her in the morning at 9AM,"so after just about a few hours of sleep I had to wake up and get dressed to leave. Did not have the chance to test how much patience was needed to take a hot shower. She made some delicious blueberry muffins for breakfast.\"",,,
60029,168607,2011-01-09,337331,Eugene,"Staying here was great.  I had a very enjoyable experience.  Right from the get-go, Michelle picked me up from the subway station, and walked me back to her home (because it's a little hard to find otherwise, its also a 8 block walk).  Providing me with information about boston, offering to cook breakfast, throwing in fruit and cookies, she was very mother-like.  I would have loved to stay for longer.  Also, the bed was amazingly comfortable with velvet sheets."
60029,169941,2011-01-12,340692,Vanessa,"Michelle is a gracious, generous host. Her home is spacious, cozy, clean, warm and beautiful. The neighborhood has a lot of character also. Such a bargain at so low a rate. She is so thoughtful and knows all kinds of things about Boston. Michelle also fed me delicious homemade granola, bananas and tea. Her home is a gem and so is she. I am definitely going to stay with her again. I highly recommend her to anyone passing through Boston."
60029,171645,2011-01-17,307907,Lisette,I had such a lovely time in Boston staying with Michelle. Due to the snow storms I was forced to change my arrival date and Michelle was very flexible with that. It is easy to get to and from the city centre from her house. Michelle was a wonderful host with loads maps and information. She gave me all the privacy I needed and always up for a friendly chat and drink. Thanks Michelle!
60029,174200,2011-01-24,331641,SHireen,"I had a wonderful stay at Michelle's despite Boston being frigidly cold. Michelle had thought of everything to make my stay comfortable and easy. She provided shoe grippers for the ice and snow, wonderful coffee, an umbrella, maps...She is very well versed in the history of Boston and the neighborhoods. You couldn't ask for a better place to stay!! I look forward to another visit!!"
60029,179773,2011-02-08,343508,Sabrina,"Michelle is a great host, she really takes care about her guests. She is helpful but also an interesting person to chat! Her house is very old but I'm used to old buildings and I didn't miss anything. It's a quiet neiborghhood on a hill. I can recommend to stay with Michelle and I would definitely come back!"
60029,188158,2011-02-25,332178,Kate,"Michelle was a fantastic host, and we had a lovely time staying with her. Her house is interesting and kooky and very warm and snug. Michelle herself is brilliant , she is great to talk too and is very kind hearted and thoughtful. She is never pushy or intrusive but gave a lot of helpful suggestions and is just a lovely person to stay with. I could go on....but you should meet her yourself! We will remember our stay for her company and the cookies!"
60029,193121,2011-03-06,106229,Scott,"Michelle was a great hostess, helping me out with ideas for what to do and see during my stay in the city. The apartment is lovely and in a great location. I felt very welcome the whole time and enjoyed talking to Michelle. Hope to go back again sometime!"
60029,193504,2011-03-07,311837,Mary,"Michelle was a wonderful hostess! She met us at Roxbury Crossing when we arrived and walked us to her house, giving us some historical information about the neighborhood along the way. The house was immaculate and beautifully decorated. Our bed was very comfortable and Michelle gave wonderful suggestions for activities. Michelle made breakfast for us (delicious coffee and homemade blueberry muffins, the leftovers of which she was also kind enough to send with us on the bus to NYC). She walked us out to the bus stop on check out day to make sure we made it to South Station on time. We couldn't have asked for a more gracious hostess. I highly recommend this listing and plan to stay with Michelle again next time I'm in Boston (and hopefully I can return to the lovely city again soon). My friend and I were only able to stay for one night, but thanks to Michelle, we had a comfortable short stay and got a nice feel for Boston."
60029,199056,2011-03-14,386520,Alyssa,"Michael and I enjoyed our stay with Michelle. She's incredibly gracious and a very good hostess. She provided us with food, maps and plenty of ideas for going out to eat (loved the Penguin!). She knows her city well and provides a wonderful room and bath. It was warm and cozy (even the sheets were fuzzy and warm). I would highly recommend staying with Michelle only if you are conscientious and truthful. Stay away all you grunions! I have only positive things to say about our stay, we had a lovely weekend (despite poor weather and a flat tire)."
60029,208748,2011-03-25,439003,Michaela,"Michelle - we are missing her now - away from her nice flat, that is really an alternative for staying in a hostel or in a hotel."
She is such an extraordinary host and woman,that we felt pity to leave Boston,(though it was so cold in town).The sun was shining everyday,and if not - she would have been the sun,that gave us a warm feeling. Michelle is that friendly,open and warmhearted
She is loving nature and is aware of stupid things happening on earth,done by unconscious people.  she lives. respectfull and full of consciousness saving  environment,caring for her district and neighbours and people around,"Wonderful host! \"",,

She a greatest host I've ever met. She's very kind,friendly and good cooking :) and you can find any answer about the boston's things from her.,,,,
The place is so warm and safe. It has everything that you want. Internet,cook (include homemade food),clean bathroom,clean bedroom etc. The neighbor hood is nice and peaceful.,,
Michelle help me a lot of things when I went there. I stay with her for four nights before I move to the Apartment. Actually if I didn't deposit to the apartment before I went to Boston,I will ask her to rent the room instant,haha :),,,
"It was one of my best and great experience to stay in \"\"Room in the heart of Boston\"\". Thanks for a million times for everything. Keep in touch and absolutely see you next time!!",,,,,
"PS. If anyone want some more details or questions. You can send the E-mail to me.\"",,,,,
60029,221230,2011-04-09,414030,Wen Hsin,Michelle is a really great host who really puts in a lot of effort in what she does. The day I came down I had some complications in my timing and she did what she could despite her busy schedule to meet up with me and bring me around. She also gave me a short tour as we made our way up the steep slopes and made sure to stop a few times at certain road intersections to orientate me.
The place itself is charming. It's in a quiet neighbourhood and from here you can more or less walk to almost anywhere in Boston,like I did,if you're up for it. Michelle has in stock quite a variety of food and beverages so there's always something to eat or drink here - plus it's healthy stuff,"so after eating all the sinful food outside you can come back and purge all that away. Her bed is also really comfortable! I had a great stay and definitely will consider staying here again if I get the opportunity to come to Boston again.\"",,
60029,224363,2011-04-12,429389,Bob,She was really nice and helpful
60029,240710,2011-04-26,385947,Conny + Andreas,"What a welcome! It was like coming home. Michellle introduces her guests in her neighbourhood Roxbury and in Boston like someone who loves the town. She knows so much: history, presence and future. We recommend to follow her advices. She realizes what fits to the guests. The room is cozy, quiet. The bed is so comfortable and convenient. All the rooms are shaped lovely. After being hosted by Michelle we are convinced that we should share our rooms in Berlin, too."

She provided us a healthy and varied breakfast every morning along with some fun conversation. We really appreciated all of the effort she put into welcoming us into her home and the city."

60029,351623,2011-07-04,657185,Maria Helena,"This was our first time at a bed and breakfast and the experience could not have been nicer! Michelle not only made us comfortable and welcome in her home, but was gracious and generous in a very personal way, sharing details of daily life in Boston which gave us a vivid picture of the city. We loved her neighborhood with its quaint old houses and friendly people. The room was neat and simple, the shared bathroom was clean and oh! that bathtub, straight out of an antique dealer's magazine. The breakfasts were not only delicious but very healthy, I'm trying to emulate Michelle's eating habits starting with the home made granola. All in all it was an enriching experience and we congratulate Michelle for a job well done."
60029,373979,2011-07-15,614356,Lindsay,Michelle is a very warm and carring person. My friend stayed at her apartment for 2 few days and liked it a lot.

60029,392418,2011-07-24,401929,Jim,"Michelle was not only a fabulous host, but a friendly and Boston-knowledgeable innkeeper that will make anyone's trip to Boston a little easier.  She was more than accommodating when I had to add an extra day and when I arrived I was treated to some afternoon snacks and a few quick shortcuts to where I needed to get to around the city which was a must for this Boston-newbie.  Michelle had all the insight on the best places to go out to for dinner/drinks that were easy to get to and she did everything she could to make me feel at home while I visited for an entire week.  Close to anything in Boston via taxi, bus or subway.  The house is adorable and will fit anyone's needs and you can't beat the price when you're a mile from the South End.  Please visit her and her beautiful home and you won't be disappointed!"
60029,402987,2011-07-28,821123,Frédéric,"Michelle was nice to us, we feel in our own place. We spent few days and we will keep a very good remind of this experience. For a bedroom at this price, you can not expect better! Very comfy bedroom, nice shared bathroom and great kitchen."

She was an extremely gracious host, fun loving and great to talk to. Best of all, she knew Boston like the back of her hand, the quirky spots, the best places to go. Even if she didnt, she made it a point to check it out. She always made sure we were feeling comfortable and made the most amazing cinnamon rolls and muffins. It was like being at home with Michelle."

The room was clean and a good size. The breakfast was nice and there was a huge selection of tea available. Also the bathroom was clean and a good size.

60029,585299,2011-10-01,890289,Hugo,"The room is very comfortable and the house is very well located. Easy access to metro. The bathroom is large and clean. But the best part of this room is the wonderful feeling of being at home. This sensation is provided by Michelle, a great woman, very respectful, very kind, funny, always ready to help us! I spent fifteen days in her excellent company. For shure, if I return to Boston, I would stay again in her home."

The room is perfect for one person but I suppose a couple would have no problems either. Everything was clean and tidy. Michelle makes awesome granola bars and muffins and the coffee is delicious:). She filled me in on what was going on in the city and suggested various attractions. I will definitely stay with her again if I'm in Boston again.

The house was cosy and warm and because it is situated out of the hussle and bussle of the mid city it was very nice to come home to after a days exploring.
60029,969961,2012-03-04,1763508,Elisabetta,"I loved my stay with Michelle. The house has a warm and cozy feeling and you can tell that it is loved.

I also always felt safe when walking around alone. Michelle... what to say? She is great. Since the beginning, it was like meeing a good friend. She picked me up at the airport, baked muffins in the morning and even dropped me at the bus station when I had to leave. She is interesting and engaging while respectful of your private space. You can tell that she enjoys having people around and sharing her city and house with them. I will defenitely stay with her next time I will be in Boston."

She made sure I was taken care of, but gave plenty of space for me to explore on my own. She provided me with all the tools I needed to navigate the city with ease and has an extensive knowledge of events happening in Boston. She provided a tasty, nutritious, and filling breakfast for me each day and makes the best homemade chocolate cookies. She is a Superhost, indeed."

The house is beautiful with lots of light, and after a long day of walking it was great to crawl under  the super warm covers. Every morning we enjoyed her delicious muffins, a great start to the day. The house is a 10 min walk from the subway, but if you’d like to see as much as Boston as you can, you can even walk to downtown (about 45 minutes).

The area was nice and it was close to the T where we could head into the city, which was 20 minutes away. Michelle showed us where the T stop was as well as the closest bus stop so we saved a lot of money on transportation. She was also able to recommend some places worth going to since she is a native of Boston. Her muffins and granola bars were delicious and it filled us up for the whole day.

Michelle was an exemplary host who made sure everything was perfect for us. We had a great time and a really positive experience. Getting in and out of Boston was easy.
60029,1461933,2012-06-11,1619803,Paul,"Michelle was great. She met me at the subway stop at 11PM on my first night, had a home cooked breakfast ready early in the mornings, gave me good directions and a map, and was a delight to be with. I recommend her  highly."
60029,1474431,2012-06-13,2372403,Susan,Michelle is an informative and fun host. Her accommodations are basic and comfortable. The breakfast was delightful. She likes to bake and shares her yummy goodies with her guests. She is a long time Bostonian and shares her knowlege with her guests.

From the moment I came to her place I felt like I'm at home, she prepared me coffee and breakfast every morning and gave me useful tips for my short stay in Boston, If i ever come to Boston again I would definitely stay here. Thank you Michelle! :)"

She made us breakfast, which was delicious - muffins and muesli and soo much fruit. She was great with communication. Thanks Michelle!"
60029,1690685,2012-07-12,2413387,Hanne,Nice place to stay. Michelle is very nice to stay with. A bit warm in the summer without AC.
60029,1721243,2012-07-16,2624533,Cheryl,Staying at Michelle's couldnt be better!
Firstly,Michelle made us feel so at home with her warm and vibrant personality. She met us up at the t-station when we first arrived and walked us to her place. This left us such a good impression of Bostonians! Of course the other Bostonians we met were just as friendly and nice.,,,,
Secondly,our rooms were so comfy. Had one of my best nights there. A pity we stayed in Boston for only a few days.,,,,
Lastly,On the day of our departure,which was before daylight,Michelle called us a taxi and even woke up to send us out. Not all host would go all out to make you feel at home.,,
We will definitely recommend staying at Michelle's when you visit Boston to truly experience the Boston way of life!,,,,,
Thank you Michelle,"Charles and I really enjoyed our stay! :D\"",,,,

60029,1790743,2012-07-24,2661145,Cécile,"We had a nice stay in Boston with Michelle. There is a 10mn walk to the closest subway station (Roxbury crossing) which was very practical to visit the city without taking the car. The house is old but comfortable, with everything you might need, and Michelle was nice and helpful. The only negative point for us was that we didn't feel the neighborhood was safe enough to take the subway in the evening, and didn't get a chance to ask Michelle about it because she was very busy during the 3 days of our stay."
60029,1836413,2012-07-30,2513873,Annaleigh,"This was our first time using airbnb, and it was a great experience. We went to a conference at Northeastern University, which is about a 20-25 minute walk away. It took us 10-12 minutes to walk to and from the Ruggles T stop, so it was a good location for us. The house is really nice, and Michelle was kind enough to make sure we had stuff to eat for breakfast (we're vegan)."

60029,2091192,2012-08-25,3046696,Kevin,"Michelle was a terrific hostess.  She met me at Roxbury Crossing station, and provided clear, specific guidance on getting from the station to her home, which was at most a 10-15 minute walk.  She also provided many suggestions on things to do and visit in Boston, and has extensive knowledge and deep affection for the city."
I rented the less expensive of the two rooms available.  It was clean,well-lit,and very comfortable,and the overall home was gorgeous.  I had an excellent experience,"and would highly recommend Michelle to anyone looking for an inexpensive way to visit Boston.\"",

She makes a superb breakfast,you'll see,not spoiling the surprise here!,,,
A very convenient place to stay in Boston,with a twist of good ol days America,a wooden townhouse (almost) on top of a hill,"a very quiet and relaxing area.\"",,
60029,2714084,2012-10-25,424238,Pierre,My stay was perfect. Michelle was nice and very helpful. She even gave a bike to go to work while I was there. The breakfast was also very good. She is definitely a great cook. I would recommend this place to everybody.
60029,3049358,2012-12-09,1843712,Sigrid,"I stayed with Michelle again because I loved the stay with her in May. This time it was even better. I got the same room - cosy, clean and comfortable-, we had a great time and Michelle was the greatest host you could probably imagine. Thanks again and see you next time!!"
60029,4194308,2013-04-17,5289382,Daniel,"i stayed in the michelle's house and from the first time we saw each other, she treated me as if she know me forever, making me feel confortable."
then she don't mind to walk with me showing me shortcuts to get the downtown or places to eat.,,,,,
this was my first time using airbnb,but if i comeback to boston surely i will choose to stay in the michelle house.,,,,
i have no words to say how happy and lucky  i feel for  being directed with such a great person.,,,,,
i highly recomend this place to stay.,,,,,
"THANKS AIRBNB\"",,,,,
60029,4267403,2013-04-23,68979,Sue,Michelle is a thoughtful and gracious hostess.  She even walked me down to the Norteastern campus so I could learn the quickest route.  It is a lovely 20 minute walk.  She lives in a charming neighborhood overlooking the city. Room and bathroom accommodations were just fine.  Comfortable bed. I already told Michelle I will be back to stay when my son graduates next year.
60029,4528435,2013-05-11,2361742,Perrine,We spent a very nice stay in Michelle's house. Our bedroom was really clean and comfortable and the breakfast was awesome. Michelle has been helpful and generous with us.

60029,5447512,2013-07-01,5174947,Yoan,Fantastic ! Fantastic is the word I will use If I had to describe my stay at Michelle's House. But I need more than 1 word to describe the place I lived for a month.
The appartment is really beautiful,I had a big room,quiet,with a fan and a desk,just perfect for the summer ! I slept really good !,
But the most important : Michelle !,,,,,
It's impossible to describe the goodness and kindness that Michelle has. She is the nicest person by far I have ever seen ! She's thoughtful,nice,always smiling,cooking really good meals,always here for you if you need her ... and the list go on !,
I'm so glad to meet her,she was essential for me ! And she will probably be essential for you if you didn't know Boston !,,,,
I think that my description and my words can't describe Michelle as perfectly as she is,the best thing to do is to try and discover by yourself what kind of person she is and I promess ... you won't regret it !,,,,
If you have to go in Boston,"Michelle is definitevely the host you need :) !!!\"",,,,
60029,7289415,2013-09-14,1751120,Siva,"Michelle was very nice and kind. She is always thinks about your needs ahead of yourself. Weather permitting, easy 10 min walk to subway station in safe neighborhood."
60029,7392500,2013-09-18,1705091,Louise,"I loved the room.  It felt like I was in a tree house up amongst the tree tops.  The house is very comfortable and Michelle is a great host.  Easy walk to both a train and bus stop and if you have 45  minutes to spare, it is a lovely easy walk into town.  Highly recommend this wonderful residence.  A beaut breakfast is available with your choice of beverage.   Michelle loves to share her knowledge of this interesting neighbourhood whilst you walk back to her place fom the station.  You too should enjoy this experience."
60029,8333940,2013-10-26,2895852,Joanie,"Ahh, to review Michelle!  :)"
Michelle is a super blend of the hostess with the mostest,friend,animal whisperer.  And I know this is just in the few days I spent with her.  :)  She knows what she's doing.  I'm glad she decided to open her home up on Airbnb; especially to visitors as far flung as Australia,Italy,Brazil-or me; just from Las Vegas but new to New England and traveling solo.,
From my first interaction; she offered to let me stow my luggage for me in her car while she worked (I came in a few hours before she would be able to welcome me to her home),homemade granola and blueberry goodness I enjoyed in her cheerful fuschia kitchen,to the last night Thai dinner with her other boarders,this place was warm and welcoming.  She was respectful of my privacy as well; silently proffering a space heater outside my door when the weather suddenly cooled.  This is how good she is to all; a neighborhood stray  momma cat has devotedly affixed herself to Michelle (even if in a room with other hands to pet her) because  animals just KNOW. There is such warmth and graciousness and genuine concern for others that emanates.  It's an innate ability.,,
Stay here if you need a friendly and respectful place to stay.  The room is comfortable,the neighborhood is beautiful,and I would recommend it to any of my friends traveling to Boston in the future.,,,

60029,8520125,2013-11-04,2313906,Jeanette,"This was truly my best airbnb-stay till now! The house and room were really nice, comfortable and clean with everything you need from a great hot shower and a good breakfast available. But also by staying with Michelle you get the feeling as if you were staying at a friends house, she makes you feel very comfortable and welcome, is always there if you have any questions or needs and is truly an amazingly kind person."
"Would recommend this stay to everyone! Thanks a million Michelle!\"",,,,,
60029,21025395,2014-10-10,12798354,Minh-Thi,"\"Very unpleasant experience. Michelle accused me of breaking into her apartment even though check out time wasn't till 5pm (which means I still had the keys until then) and I even left way before that at 2pm. Apparently the sweet note and the cake that I left for my roommate was the \"\"copious and concrete evidence\"\" of me gaining forbidden access. Good thing I had 2 friends to witness what was going on so I definitely recommend having witnesses when you leave the house. After talking to the airbnb agent he agreed that I didn't do anything wrong. \""
60029,34345699,2015-06-07,33943739,Brendan,Michelle was very nice and a good host. She made made sure I was comfortable and had maps and other advice for navigating the city and finding things to do. She was available if I needed anything and checked in with me frequently. I was very happy with my experience with Michelle.
60029,34581088,2015-06-09,34670527,Tom,"Staying with Michelle made my whole Boston experience truly amazing. Went to Boston for the Early Music  Festival mostly held around the New England Conservatory / Museum of Fine Arts ( i.e. a very short trip from her location) and while Monteverdi’s Ulisse Opera and Jordi Savall fulfilled every bit of my music thirst it was Michelle’s great hospitality that won the trip. Since the very first day she took care of every detail picking me at the nearest mbta station ( a very short walk from her place)  and welcomed with a delicious breakfast of homemade carrot walnut cupcakes, dragon pearls green tea and fresh strawberries. What else to ask for? Right? She didn’t spare any minute to give me practical travel advice or keep helping me. She even called a last minute taxi for me when I was late for my concert covering the payment with her own card! The room I stayed in was really comfortable as well, I usually have trouble sleeping outside home but this wasn’t the case at Michelle’s probably because the room had the right combination of cleanliness, low light at night and good ventilation… ah and the right blankets of course ( Michelle actually uses designer  brand blankets although she doesn’t admits it. I checked the labels myself) Overall I would very happily return to her place on my next trip to Boston."
60029,34831807,2015-06-12,35244046,Sherry & Paul,Michelle went out of her way to meet us at the tube station and on the walk back to her place she pointed out several places of interest.  She also suggested places to go and gave us directions which was very helpful.
60029,35500766,2015-06-19,13676082,Laetitia,"Michelle est une hôte très accueillante (et qui parle français). Je la remercie pour ses conseils, ses muffins, sa balade pour aller manger un très bon lobster chowder et le fait de s'être levée à 2h30 du matin pour attendre mon taxi.

She is very helpful to indicate your way or what you can do and see in the surroundings. She even baked muffins for me in the morning and show me my way to the bus station so that I could go quickly to South Station. I totally recommend her house.

It's a good place to live if you have a company, but you might want to do some research about that area if you are coming alone. I ended up not living in the room out of my personal concern of security.  However, I can tell that the host is a really nice person and the room is really spacey. Thanks!"

Not only is the house a fab place to stay,but it's very close to both the bus station (about a 3-minute walk to the bus station which takes you straight into town) and Roxbury Crossing. Commuting was very easy to get used to (I don't drive,so relied on buses/trains and found that it was rather easy as the house was so close). Plus,the Dudley Cafe is nearby which I found to be a great place for a latte and snack.,,

Every house is in multicolored, majestic victorian style... and my love for architecture and history, had my breath taken away every time i stepped outside. There are two separate and convenient train lines to access the neighborhood, each with their own stops two blocks away on either side of the house (10 min walk or less)."
You will be staying in the basement (separated from house,feels totally private) with 4 bedrooms,each set up to accommodate a different airbnb guest. There is a cute shared kitchen and bathroom area for all guests. Also an adorable backyard space. There was only one other guest staying while we were there but we never saw them and pretty much had the place to ourselves. What a great value!,,,
Although i never saw carols personally,her brother escorted me to our room and he was a total sweetheart. There is loving family energy at the house and i felt safe (and at home) returning there.,,,,
One thing to be aware of that the house is located in a lower income neighborhood,"which some people may refer to as the \"\"inner-city\"\".  The very first thing i thought when i exited the train station was \"\"i am in the hood\"\". Liquor stores",auto shops,"cars blasting rap music with heavy bass... My first sight was was a man on a 4-wheel ATV loudly blasting down the boulevard while busting a wheelie the entire way (our uber driver confirmed that we were staying in the \"\"ghetto\"\"). Being a white couple from LA",We actually LOVED the experience and felt at home in the community. Not once did i feel endangered,threatened

La chambre est vraiment petite,mais correcte. Il faut savoir que la salle de bain et la cuisine sont partagées avec les autres locataires.,,,,
La propreté est à améliorer : baignoire (notamment le tapis anti glissant... hygiène zero),frigo (très très sale et très mauvaises odeurs,je n'ai même pas voulu y laisser ma bouteille de jus d'orange !). Il faudrait aussi améliorer le système de ventilation car la chambre sentait vraiment le renfermer.,,,

A lot of construction going on right now in the area, but it is a pretty sweet area.

The unit itself (including furniture) is also very new and clean. There were welcome packages left by the host, which was nice. Two of the three rooms were pretty spacious, one of them was smaller and could only fit a twin bed. The living room is also on the smaller size. Since I'm from NY, the smaller spaces don't bother me. There's also a Sweetgreen salad, a bunch of shops, restaurants and bars within short walking distance.  Overall, I enjoyed the stay a lot, and would definitely be back."

It was conveniently located near Downtown Crossing and State Street T stops.  The building is secure with a full time doorman and 24 hour security.  Flora communicated with me often before, during and after the stay so I was fully aware of all of the details I needed to have a smooth check in and exit from the building/apt.   Upon entering the apartment, I found a welcome note with a little care basket containing among other things an energy bar, tea bags and chocolates.  That was a very nice touch making you feel right at home.  I highly recommend this apartment if you want to visit Boston. Flora is a wonderful host!"

The arboretum is a short distance away and it is gorgeous. The Co-op is also very close for food shopping. Their place is very close to the T ( orange line) so very convenient to use public transportation  to go into town. All in all an enjoyable experience!

I was not familiar with the concept of BnBs prior to arriving. I assumed it's how they have live in home rooms in the South: breakfast is cooked for you upon waking up. I was wrong,but I that didn't disappoint my stay.,,,,
The property is quaint and on the third floor. Be prepared to climb steps.,,,,,

5729845,37927112,2015-07-11,17658818,Jeff,"Jon and Lisa were very gracious hosts. Since they couldn't be there to greet me, they gave explicit directions on how to get the keys from a lockbox on the front door of the building. The location is very convenient to the Forest Hills station of the Orange Line. Jon and Lisa made a point of engaging in conversation to make me feel welcome. Their cat Zoe is ADORABLE. The room and apartment were tidy. They generously offered to let me help myself to breakfast food. That wasn't necessary, however, since they are very close to the natural foods co-op."

It gave us the instructions About public transportation. Although I would advise people coming from Boston South station to take the commuter rail to the apartment as it is faster and cheaper. Our check-in didn't go as good as expected and they felt bad about it which show that they care about their guests."
The location of the apartment is near the train station (less than 5mn walk)and not far from downtown Boston (20mn) which was very convenient.,,,,,
They have a very sweet cat.,,,,,
The only comments I would give to make this experience better : is that maybe there were too many hair in the bathroom (but it is normal as Lisa has nice long hair) and the bed made a bit of noise (but if you have a heavy sleep it is not a problem :),,,,,
Thanks again for your welcome and your kindness :),,,,,

They were very communicative leading up to my arrival and even have a cool map of the house if you end up not seeing them in person. They were generous, helpful and I actually was sad I didn't have more time to get to know them. They really seem relaxed in terms of hosting, which is such a plus when it comes to sharing space. If you need a place to lay your head, a short walk from the bus/subway line in JP, this is the place to stay!"

It was just what I needed as a temporary place to stay during my move from out of state. Jon and Lisa were friendly and accommodating and overall made me feel welcome. I enjoyed talking with them about books, boardgames, and everything else. I also liked socializing with their affectionate cat, Zoe, who frequently kept me company. I highly recommend these hosts!"

They did everything they can to make us feel comfortable (if there is a problem just let them know and they will find a solution). Unfortunately, we stayed just two nights at their place."
The room was small but very neat,cozy and clean just like the entire apartment. The futon and the street were a bit noisy but we had no problems to get some sleep. Moreover the location is close to everything you need (grocery,restaurants,bars) and the metro station is just a 5 minute walk.,,

The neighborhood was perfectly safe, and we were lucky enough to find a parking spot for the weekend right in front of the building! (free) Really ideal location for visiting Boston via public transit as it was right next to the Forest Hills stop on the orange line, and we got an amazing jalapeno cheddar bagel BLT sandwich from the farmer's market next to Sam Adam's brewery Saturday morning (2 subway stops/7 minutes away). Would definitely stay here again for another trip to Boston and highly recommend for the no frills traveler."
5729845,50219858,2015-10-10,40056316,Jenna,"I stayed with Jon and Lisa in their apartment one block from the Forest Hills T stop in Jamaica Plain for the first couple of days of a trip to explore Boston. They were very accommodating with my arrival time and departure time, leaving a key in a box for me on the first night, and letting me hang out with them and drink some tea to wait out some rain and kill some time before I left to meet with a friend on my last day."
The guest room,while small,has a lovely view out across the street to Harvard's Arnold Arboretum,which was just starting to show fall's changing colors. Future guests will be pleased to hear that the hosts just purchased a new bed and mattress for the room,which they installed the day I left. There is also a large chest of drawers to store your belongings. and hangers and hooks on the door as necessary.,
Bookish types (that's me) will fit right in with Jon and Lisa,as they both are writers -- their shelves are filled with literature and poetry. As an English major and writer myself,I very much enjoyed chatting with them about our common interests,and they were able to share information about Boston as it relates to academia and culture and give me tips on places to see and things to do.,,
They also have a cat,who is very friendly and welcoming (I'm a dog person,but didn't mind the attention),and they offered use of their kitchen area and some treats like tea,coffee,and breakfast items.
Within a block of the apartment and across from the T are a small number of restaurants and other businesses. I enjoyed a happening local coffee shop,and an Indian restaurant while I was there,and took a run through the aforementioned Arboretum.,,,
Staying with Jon and Lisa was a pleasure,and I recommend it for individuals needing a couple of nights to stay in an evolving area of Boston. They're super low key,"with few \"\"house rules\"\" and happy to get to know you and help out with your visit. Thanks","Jon and Lisa! Hope to see you again soon.\"",,

5729845,66300984,2016-03-20,2843233,Katya,"Jon, Lisa, and their cat were all great! They even accommodated my friend who decided to come last minute! The room was on the smaller side, so it is best for a solo traveller or a couple. The location was great, just a few blocks away from the T station. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the room was freezing the entire time (and the heating vents seemed to only give off cold air)! It was a very cold weekend, so perhaps the apartment would be best for summer stays in the future."

5729845,70748198,2016-04-20,23025847,Jose,Jon and Lisa were perfect hosts when I stayed with them during the Boston Marathon week. They made me feel at home with few house rules. They were easy to talk to as if we've been friends before.
I have no issue with the room being small as long as it is clean and the bed is comfortable which they are.  My only challenge was sleeping on the first night (Friday) as it was noisy due to traffic outside. I did not share it with the hosts since I knew it prior to booking. Once I bought the ear plugs the following day,I did not have problem sleeping.,,,,
Over all,my stay with Jon and Lisa was very pleasant and also very pleased with the result of second Boston Marathon.,,,,

The location is practically next to the train station going into Boston which is so convenient - but we also loved the accessibility to 'downtown' Jamaica Plain. We meant to spend more time in downtown Boston but just loved the JP neighbourhood - there were even fantastic restaurants and the cutest coffee shop with live music just steps from this place. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. They were quick to respond to any questions I had and were flexible about arrival times when I was stuck in traffic. I was only sorry we couldn't stay longer and didn't get a chance to hang out with the hosts or take advantage of all the books of poetry. =)"

Die Gegend ist bestens an das U-Bahn-Netz angegliedert; es sind nur 5 Minuten Fußweg vom Haus zur nächsten Station. Ebenfalls nur wenige Gehminuten vom Haus entfernt ist ein Bio-Supermarkt mit einem großen Angebot an allerlei Köstlichkeiten.,,,,,

While I was only there for a weekend and did not spend much time indoors, I found the quarters  to be clean, well-kept, comfortable and easily navigable. A definite highlight of the stay was getting to meet the inhabitants and hearing  about their lives and interests, and their willingness to include you in whatever plans they may have, in such a manner that you very quickly feel like a part of the house."

5293067,27553541,2015-03-07,27556153,Emilie,"I stay two nights there, the severals hosts are welcoming. But the dirt of the place make me very unconfortable."
5293067,29063486,2015-04-03,29211508,Guillaume,My stay at Kaitlin's was great. she made me feel super confortable and like at home right away. the bedroom is very confortable and I will definitely come back there ! Thank you soooo much !
5293067,43541149,2015-08-20,39868802,Terry,"We did not have many opportunities to get to know our hosts.  They were away on vacation when we arrived, however, we were made aware of this ahead of time.  They arrived home on the Monday (we arrived on Saturday)."
A deciding factor for us booking here was the 6 min walk to the subway on the Orange line. However,the subway was closed for renovations on weekends in August and this information was not relayed to us.  We had to find out on our own that we needed to catch a shuttle bus to Ruggles station (this added about 20 minutes to our travels each morning and night).,,,,
This home is supposed to have air conditioning and it definitely did not.  We were on the 3rd level in 30 degree temperatures with 2 small fans in our room,which did not cool the room much.,,,,
They promote 2 bathrooms,however,the one on the 2nd floor was too dirty to be usable.  Hot water was plentiful and the shower had good pressure,but the outlets and the fan did not work,and the floor was very dirty.  When we first arrived there was not a hand towel or soap in the bathroom,however
We were each given a bath towel with shampoo and conditioner,but no wash cloth (even when we asked for one there was none available).,,,,
The kitchen was clean with lots of dishes,and utensils but there was only one small frying pan and small pot to cook with. Breakfast was listed as eggs and toast but we could not find the eggs.,,,,
The house has WIFI,however,it does not work for everyone.  My travel companion had it work on her phone,but it did not ever work on mine.,,
If I return to the Boston area I would not stay here again,and I would not recommend this place.,,,,

5293067,47450074,2015-09-18,1293571,Jack,Kaitlin accepted my request at the very last minute which was a huge help! She was very friendly and chilled out! Thanks Kaitlin
5293067,48017190,2015-09-22,43118687,Kristen,"Very easy stay!  Enjoyed the privacy of the room.  Never actually met Kaitlin, but had few issues.  We had a little trouble with the door and couldn't connect to the wifi, but since we were out so much of the time it didn't make too much of a difference.  Kaitlin made it very easy to pick up the key even though we weren't sure what time we'd be arriving.  Not the fanciest, but certainly a cozy stay."
5293067,50230439,2015-10-10,38930568,Chen,Everything is as stated. Friendly environment all facilities available.
Enjoyed my stay,"would recommend. \"",,,,
5293067,50591929,2015-10-12,45947749,Carol,"Kaitlin thoughtfully switched our room from one on the third floor to one on the first, once she saw my knee brace from recent surgery."
5293067,51668807,2015-10-22,45558197,Kat,"Kaitlin was extremely helpful and welcoming. Thanks again for accommodating my late booking and not hesitating to share your space-heater (a huge plus, since I get cold easily)."
Kitchen had everything I needed,the artist's loft was the right size for the price,"and the neighbourhood was quiet. Check out JP Licks (and of course the Sam Adams brewery) just down the street if you can!\"",,,
5293067,53517465,2015-11-09,46698041,Emily,Kaitlin made us feel very welcome! The area was great and there was a lot to do!! I would recommend staying here!
5293067,54260478,2015-11-17,981531,Ana,"Kaitlin welcomed me in her home and made sure I have what I needed.  She even borrowed me her hair dryer. The room was fine and I really liked the kitchen as well. The only thing is that there is no heating in the room but Kaitlin helped with that as well. Also, the house is in a convenient and quiet neighbourhood, very close to an orange line station."
One of the things I didn't like the most is the fact that the room is on the third floor while the bathroom is on the first floor. The stairs you have to climb are quite old,slippery and very noisy. The other thing is that the bathroom wasn't clean all the time,"only on the day the cleaner came by.\"",,,
5293067,55128359,2015-11-28,29071252,Claudia,Nice room in a nice house! Thanks for the hospitality.
5293067,56618872,2015-12-15,45934621,Carlos,"Kaitlin is a kind, welcoming host and although I only saw her for a few days, she always kept in contact with me to make sure things were OK. Even when I asked her for a hair dryer, she provided one for me. The listing was just as described; a clean, comfy room with a large bed. I found the neighborhood to be very safe and the metro orange line is only a few blocks away, which was a big plus for me. Overall, I was satisfied to have stayed at her place. My first AirBNB experience was a positive one!"
5293067,59134556,2016-01-07,47804639,Florian,Easy going. Didn't meet Kaitlin but her helper showed me everything. If you need anything Kaitlin responses very fast! I would recommend her place. The room is small but cozy and  offers enough space for one person! Planning a trip to Boston? Go to Kaitlin!
5293067,66981197,2016-03-26,32874420,Michelle,Jamacia Plain was such a beautiful and safe neighborhood for my boyfriend and I to stay in! The houses were gorgeous- including this listing!
The hosts were very flexible with our arrival time,and made it very easy to access the house and room key. We were told before arrival that our room wouldn't be clean when we got there,but there was enough advanced notice that it was no problem at all. We found a cute restaurant that was just 10 minutes of walking away,and enjoyed the city while our room was cleaned.,,
The orange line was only a five minute walk away,along very well lit pathways and sidewalks.,,,,
The bathrooms were very clean,along with the kitchen.,,,,
Even though we didn't spend a whole lot of time there (there's so much to see in Boston!),"I would highly recommend this listing for a cheap way to enjoy the city :)\"",,,,

5293067,71014629,2016-04-22,2123529,Dainius,"Great place. Kaitlin - very responsive, room - lots of privacy, quiet. Place has everything I needed. Neighborhood - also great, quiet, residential but easily reachable by subway. Recommend it!"

5293067,88766437,2016-07-25,23745373,Rowena,Fast reply! Kaitlin was really nice.
"Quiet and nice neighborhood \"",,,,,
5293067,93990105,2016-08-14,85393483,Elizabeth,The location is excellent for traveling to/from Boston.  The neighborhood is safe and there is enough on the street parking if you have a car.  The walk to either the Green Street or Stony Brook stops on the orange line of the T are quick and easy.
Kaitlyn is a great hostess and easy to communicate with.  She does her best to accommodate all your needs.,,,,,
This room is very small and up on the third floor.  The bathrooms are on the second or first floor.  The kitchen is on the first floor.  You have to be comfortable with going up/down stairs if staying in this room.,,,,,
My son initially stayed in the first floor room which was much bigger and nicer.  If you have a choice between the first floor or third floor,"go with the first floor.  It is more spacious and convenient.\"",,,,
5293067,98830912,2016-09-02,45777958,Harry,"This apartment was perfect for me. The room was comfortable, quiet and private. The neighbourhood was also quiet but with good access to more lively areas. All the facilities were in good shape: well-equipped kitchen, laundry, bathrooms. I didn't use the wifi so I can't comment on that. The host was very friendly and helpful, even when I locked myself out. Overall, I would recommend to a friend, especially given the rates."
12020004,77231422,2016-05-30,64112466,Kari,Rafael was very nice and accommodating.
12020004,78548859,2016-06-07,44314192,Jean,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
12020004,84147450,2016-07-05,69844102,Kylie,"Rafael was out of town the weekend we stayed, however, he made accommodations for us and made check in and check out very convenient. The apartment was as advertised with the exception of the fact that there was not AC in each room and we also did not find a hair dryer. There were fans in each room that helped cool the place down once we opened the windows. The place was clean and comfortable and had plenty of room for the four of us who stayed. The neighborhood seemed a little run down and perhaps sketchy, but was relatively quiet (with the exception of fireworks being set off at all hours with it being the 4th of July weekend), we didn't run into any problems, and our safety was never compromised. It was great that there was off-street parking available. We did not end up taking the bus or train, but used Uber instead, so I cannot comment on how close the apartment was to public transportation. Uber rides, on the 4th of July weekend, ran from about $12 to $35 (the highest being after the fireworks on the 4th), so that wasn't too pricey. Our Uber rides took about 20 minutes into the city. Overall, I would definitely book with Rafael again, though maybe in a different neighborhood. Thanks, Rafael, for your hospitality!"
12020004,93100888,2016-08-11,71848079,Todd,We really enjoyed staying in Rafael's apartment in Dorchester. Everything was as advertised and the apartment was beautiful. Rafael had an air conditioner set up in each bedroom which was awesome because it was very hot and humid during our stay. The neighborhood was very lively at night but we never had any problems and felt safe the whole time. I would recommend dealing with Rafael to anyone traveling to the Boston area.
6489209,33622303,2015-05-30,33935774,Aparna,Manuela was the perfect hostess. I loved staying at their place. The location was perfect. It is right across from the Andrew Red line and it took me no time to get to the convention center. I felt safe and very comfortable. I'd love to visit again to hang out with Manuela. I had to change my arrival date and Manuela was super flexible and willing to work with me. I felt like it my home. I had access to a kitchen and private bathroom. I can't say enough about how at home I felt.
Thanks,"Manuela for all your help. \"",,,,
6489209,38030006,2015-07-12,36562995,Ann,"Manuela was great- she had lots of great suggestions as to how to maximize my time in Boston.  Room was very clean and comfy.  Air conditioner was in room, but didn't need to use as stayed cool even though hot outside.  Was literally steps from the transit station so getting there could not have been easier. Just two stops from downtown. Manuela was able to provide great directions  on getting around.  Will stay again if I go back!"
6489209,38448464,2015-07-15,24294559,Suman,This is my 3rd time staying here. Manuela is an awesome host! She is very flexible with checkin checkout timings and very friendly and make sure their guest have everything they need!

6489209,38947679,2015-07-19,38412727,Linda,"After a very long plane trip (13 hours), I ended up being lost, but near Manuela's house. (There is a Dorchester St and a Dorchester Ave and somehow, I got on the wrong one.)  Manuela kindly stayed on the phone with me until I found her. The room was exactly as described. The public transportation hub was directly across the street. Very convenient."
Since I was travelling alone,"my personal safety was very important. I felt safe staying here and would recommend Manuela's place to others. \"",,,,
6489209,39696751,2015-07-25,38747906,Lisa,"I arrived late and not on the day I originally planned. manuela was waiting for me to help me with my bag - at 2:00am. She also had yogurts for me. Great location, comfortable room, accommodating host."
6489209,45384886,2015-09-02,36571964,David,Manuela is very accommodating. I stayed for an entire month and all of my questions and requests were always quickly and professionally addressed. The T isn't even a minute walk away and the grocery is a 3 minute walk and a T stop away. Would definitely suggest to a friend.
6489209,46197880,2015-09-08,1253841,Jo,"Manuela's house was charming and comfortable and a great location for traveling via public transit. The bus and subway stations are literally across the street which could not have been easier for us. A 10 minute walk to the beach, the place is well priced and easy to find. She is very friendly and easy to communicate with. There was little interaction, so we felt very independent and at home. The room had AC and a big fan which was perfect since the days we spent were blisteringly hot."
Overall,"we were very pleased with our choice to stay here.\"",,,,
6489209,46609713,2015-09-12,40624501,Greg,Manuela had everything arranged and made the stay very comfortable.  I appreciated her communication and she was helpful with all my inquiries.

6489209,48019968,2015-09-22,43068705,Velko,"Room was nice. Bathroom ok and clean. Transportation (Red line) was next to the house, so I could get quickly to South Station or any other sport I wanted to go."
Manuela wasn't there during my stay,so I only met her husband. I didn't see him that much!,,,,
"All in all a nice & safe place to stay in Boston! thanks a lot  \"",,,,,
6489209,48205446,2015-09-24,42912631,Tom,"Super hosts, helping out from the day I arrived to the day I left - and even inviting me for dinner. It's nice to sit on the veranda when sunny and read a book / watch the world go by. Very convenient for travel into downtown Boston and some good local pubs further up the main avenue. A bit noisy from time to time in the front room due to the buses, but no real problem."
6489209,55102092,2015-11-28,34149267,Teng,Manuela's room is cozy and clean. It's reasonable (URL HIDDEN) takes about 1 minutes to red line and 10 minutes to South Bay and 15 minutes to beach. I feel that great place to stay.
6489209,59644137,2016-01-13,28922329,Margaret,"I had a nice time here at recent conference in Boston. As said before it's very convenient for using public transportation. The room is on the second floor of the house and I hardly saw Manuela or her husband except at check-in and check-out, which was great, I felt like I had a lot of privacy. The second floor has it's own kitchen and bathroom and the bed is extremely comfortable and good wi-fi. It was a great affordable stay!"
14056340,97237068,2016-08-26,90292053,Eunhee,"It was good stay,  they were so kind and tried to help us. But there was no place to hang used towels."

8131907,53140138,2015-11-05,1544776,Joyce,"Dave's place is especially good if you have conference at Convention Center - less than a 10 minute walk.  Its clean; non cluttered; you have private bathroom; and his one roommate, in other room is very nice guy. I rarely ran into him.  Dave was easily available before and during stay by email.  I'd recommend this as spot to stay, esp. for meetings in the area."
8131907,53932262,2015-11-14,27476816,Doug,"Host met me at the door and gave me a complete walk around. The apt was as advertised— a short walk to the convention center and lots of restaurants nearby. It was bare bones furnishing but clean and quiet, a good solution to exorbitant hotel prices in this neighborhood."

It was literally only a 5 min walk from the convention center. The building was upscale and super safe and the people at the from desk were very nice.  It is a great walking neighborhood with plenty of restaurants to chose from. I had the apartment to myself the whole time. The bedroom was clean, and very comfortable with a great view of Boston.  Loved the pillows!!  I has very happy to have my own large, private bathroom.  I did’t meet David because he was out of town but I was greeted and given a tour of the apartment by his friendly brother Adam.  The hotels in the area can be very expensive so I was able to save quite a bit of money. It was a wonderful experience!!"
8131907,66671876,2016-03-24,164106,Jonah,"The apartment was as described. Great view of the water, clean, and even though it's one room/bathroom you really have the whole apartment (minus two other bedrooms that were closed and I never saw anyone else)! Best feature...the bed. DAMN it was comfortable! Almost didn't want to get out of it each morning ;-)"
8131907,68697724,2016-04-06,53953646,Sameer,Very nice apartment very close to convention area. Communication with Dave was efficient. Getting the keys was easy and checkout time was flexible. Thank you for a great stay. I will diffinitly come again. One small note: a coffee machine or a kettle will add much.

The apartment could have been a little cleaner especially the bathroom. I did not see David or his roommate for the whole time I spent there.
"It is definitely great in terms of price. \"",,,,,
8131907,73184165,2016-05-07,59996345,Julia,David did fine: he emailed me a number of times to check up on my arrival and arranged for me to be met by a friend as he was out of town. Check in and check out and access were no problem. Wifi was fine.
8131907,85134938,2016-07-10,42186999,Fiona,"David's apartment is amazing and I loved my stay there. His brother met me at the apartment and showed me around, as David and his flat-mate were both away for the whole of my visit. The apartment is huge and has fantastic views from both the bedroom and the living room. The bedroom is big and the bed super-comfortable and there is a bedside table and desk, not shown on the photos. The Seaport area is great, with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. If I'm ever in Boston again I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."

It is in a good location with restaurants close by and easy access to and from the airport (Silver Line). It's a particularly good location if you are there for a conference at the convention center, it is an ~10 minute walk."
I did not get a chance to meet David as he was out of town for my stay. He arranged for me to get in and out of the apartment though and even dealt with my changing plans and late arrival that resulted from flight problems.,,,,,
"I would stay here again.\"",,,,,
8131907,87927643,2016-07-22,43299317,Robert,Outstanding south Boston waterfront location.  David was communicative ahead of my arrival and making arrangements to get apt keys and tour was very straightforward.  Tidy apartment and it was clear that the sheets and towels had been laundered before my arrival.  I'll definitely look to stay here on my next Boston work trip.
8131907,90318004,2016-07-31,35702611,Danielle,"An overall very pleasant stay. David is very responsible to messages and took initiative to contact me before my arrival and departure. A very well kept, convenient, and clean apartment. It is just one block from my convention venue and makes it extremely easy to walk to the venue within 2 mins. Highly recommended."
14742722,98737857,2016-09-01,37626200,Paul,"Jess is a tremendous host.  She communicates well and is understanding and has amenities available.  Plus she makes you feel welcome in her apartment.  The room is just as pictured and it is an air bed but it was perfect for me.  You have your own bathroom and you cannot beat the location on Beacon Hill right in the heart of Boston.  Oh yeah, Jakob is super as well.  They are a wonderful couple and I cannot write enough nice things about how welcoming and thoughtful they both are with a very nice apartment."
3343428,58435807,2016-01-02,48813178,Amir Abbas,"Jonathan is an excellent host. The house mirrors the pictures on the listing. It is well maintained. Jonathan is very responsive, social, caring and precise. His attention to details in up-keeping this residence is exceptional. I alway enjoy my conversations with him because every time I learn something new about Boston or the US in general."
3343428,59427674,2016-01-10,53053779,Avinash,"What a fantastic experience!  Jonathan is a very welcoming host, and showed me around the place as soon as I arrived.  His house is beautiful - everything looks modern and minimal, just as his pictures describe.  My room was quite large with plenty of closet space and hangers.  Most importantly, both the neighborhood and the house were quiet from the day I arrived until the day I left, but just minutes away from the hospital and T.  I would absolutely stay here again."
3343428,60512798,2016-01-24,12683637,Ben,"Best AirBnB I have ever had the pleasure to stay in. Jonathan was warm, welcoming and extremely helpful. He is also just a great guy to chat to."
The multi-level apartment/home is immaculately clean,warm (very important in a Boston winter) and has everything you need.,,,,
The location is excellent,only a short walk to the nearest subway T-station (orange line).,,,,
Towels,shampoo,conditioner,a bath robe and a guide to the local area are all provided!,,
Also,importantly for an AirBnB,"Jonathan also gives you your space as required. \"",,,
3343428,61555275,2016-02-06,16493955,Karl-Emanuel,"I felt more than welcomed from the first email exchanges I had with Jonathan. Before arriving, he was very flexible and opened to answering all of my questions so that my arrival would go as smoothly as possible. When I arrived, the room was even bigger than I expected and the shared space was as seen on the pictures : clean, nice and convenient. Before arriving, I was wondering how it would be to commute towards downtown or other interesting neighbourhoods in Boston and I found out that it was pretty close to South End and Back Bay and a nice walk to Fenway."
3343428,91671725,2016-08-06,1886934,Kyoung,"I stayed for two weeks in July-August, and Jonathan is the best host I have ever met. I got all information about the area on my first day of stay from Jonathan.The room was very clean, large for a one  bedroom with a sofa, TV, and a small desk. full of sunshine and well-functioning air conditioning. I was very happy to stay there. Housekeeping is also excellent. Everything is cleaned and changed appropriately in common areas including the kitchen and the bathroom.  Parking was easy in nearby area without extra pay."
3343428,92662181,2016-08-09,5847612,Te,"Johnathan keeps his house neat and inviting. The room looks exactly the same, if not bigger, than what it looks like on his profile. He provided me with multiple home made maps featuring cultural significants, food options and shops in the neighborhood. He even welcomed me with the info of a jazz event happening on that weekend. We had time for a pleasant conversation and I am very glad I chose his place to stay."
3343428,92885174,2016-08-10,23084458,Mark,Jonathan was a great host and I LOVED his charming and very modern brownstone apartment.  Easily one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had to date and would highly recommend to all.
3343428,93420662,2016-08-12,13820254,Sara,"What a great place to stay. The apartment looks exactly like it does in the pictures. The place is so nice and clean. I barely saw the other people staying there. And Jonathan was a great host, even helped me carry my suitcase up the steps. The neighborhood is very cute too. Very residential area. The only downfall is there's not many amenities real close; it's about a 5-10 min walk to get coffee or food. Would definitely stay here again."
3343428,93626974,2016-08-13,1327948,Rick,"Great place. Very comfortable, clean, and quiet. Wish I could have stayed longer. Jonathan was a great host, was very organized and gave detailed instructions. Will be back."

3343428,97761630,2016-08-28,86581625,Lisa,"The host was extremely accommodating and available throughout our stay. Furthermore, he provided an array of amenities in an organized and easy to locate fashion. The location is also excellent, and the host provides a wonderful list of nearby places (confirmed: they are great) like restaurants, bars, etc. Moving in and out  is seamless, and the space is clean and organized. Would highly recommend this stress-free living space."
3343428,98537311,2016-08-31,44145399,Devin,"Jonathan was an excellent host, answering all my questions and making sure everything was going well for me.

6939162,36633495,2015-06-29,11528371,Marc,Kelley's place was very well designed and comfortable.
"Will stay there again if available. :)\"",,,,,
6939162,39969385,2015-07-27,14602676,Brian,This loft is as awesome as it appears in the listing.  Everything we needed was available.  Kelly left us a very nice welcome note and made sure we had her contact info in the event that we needed anything.
The only thing better than the loft is the neighborhood - Jamaica Plain.  City Feed & Supply is right up the block - a great place to pick up coffee,breakfast,or lunch.  Every cuisine you could want is along Centre St.  Jamaica Pond is a short walk away and was a nice place to stroll.,,,
"My wife and I had great time staying in this loft and visiting JP.  Thanks!\"",,,,,
6939162,42003148,2015-08-10,5437938,Jennifer,"The loft was just as charming in person as in the pictures and the location was awesome. Kelly left a thorough list of information for anything we might have needed including restaurant recommendations which we always like. We really enjoy trendy, interesting neighborhoods that have a lot of personality and Jamaica Plains fits that to a T. Even though we had a car, we intended to take the subway which is at the other end of the street to head towards the Back Bay area. We found out that that particular train wasn't running that day but across the street was the bus stop which was free to take on Saturdays. Yay! Totally convenient. One morning, we hit a great little breakfast/lunch place called Fiore's that was about a five minute walk. They had very interesting vegan options as well as non-vegetarian items too."
The only thing we were bummed about was not staying longer (we were only there for two nights) to hit up some of the other noted restaurants and places in the area. With that being said,"it gives us plenty of reasons to go back and hopefully stay at the loft again.\"",,,,
6939162,42304743,2015-08-12,38227931,Peng,The loft is spacious and  in a very good area in Brookline. Kelly worte a very detailed information to me but I still had a mistake to find the right door and key! How careless I was! The whole building was beautiful and amazing! It was so nice and pretty that I didn't even want to move out! The bed and sofa was comfortable too. Thanks for Kelly and we had really a great night!
6939162,42558519,2015-08-14,25822121,Keith,Kelly's loft was fantastic and she was an even better host!  The loft was located in a great place - an easy walk to the T and even shorter walk to restaurants and shops.  The loft itself was beautiful and very comfortable.  Thanks to Kelly the whole experience went off without a hitch.  If we ever head back to Boston we'd love to stay again.
6939162,43267438,2015-08-18,12531362,Elizabeth,Kelly was prompt with her replies to my queries and accurate about the description of her place.
6939162,46917212,2015-09-14,32528969,Catherine,"Kelly was very accommodating and helpful before and during our stay! Her loft is a really unique place, located right in the middle of everything. We would definitely stay again if we come back to JP!"
6939162,49672959,2015-10-05,3453651,Jeffrey,Kelly was great. She promptly answered a few questions I had about the area and her loft is fantastic.  Perfect for two people. Great location too.
6939162,50397607,2015-10-11,8302430,Emily,"Totally accurate description, beautiful apartment in a wonderful location just minutes from great restaurants and shops. Not a far walk from the beautiful Jamaica Pond either. Kelly made check-in very easy. Although I had some airline trouble, Kelly was easy to stay in communication with. Hope to stay there again soon when I can have more time there!"
6939162,53529148,2015-11-09,40704816,Shariq,Loved the loft and Kelly was absolutely amazing.

6939162,58718018,2016-01-03,42810207,Emily,"My boyfriend and I spent New Year's Eve here and had a wonderful experience. The place is absolutely beautiful, had a great cozy and homey feel, and included everything we needed. We watched Netflix, cooked lasagna, decorated cupcakes, etc. The neighborhood is also great and super close to public transportation. I also just loved the setup of the place, with the lofted bedroom and all. Kelly was also a joy to work with and provided us with all the information and instruction we needed. Great at communication and was very comprehensive in taking care of things for us."
6565713,37109209,2015-07-04,224645,Xu,Steven is a very nice host. He helped us find a parking spot and gave us a tour at the Bay area.
6565713,37407836,2015-07-06,37035558,James,"The host was very friendly and accommodating, he worked around our schedule to fit in the check in time. The house was very cozy and welcoming.

He took me around the area and showed me restaurants and things to do in South Boston. The neighborhood was very nice and clean. Everything you could need was within walking distance from the house including a pharmacy, convenient store and many restaurants. Also, the house is close to public transportation which was very convenient for us. The home was very clean, comfortable and inviting. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed this home in South Boston and hope to visit again!"
6565713,38173464,2015-07-13,15283581,Philip,Visit was great. Everything was well orchestrated and communication was great. The place is much better in person than the photos indicate!
6565713,38348083,2015-07-14,37931903,Andrea,Steven made this experience so enjoyable. The house was so very easy to access and it was just absolutely beautiful inside and out. The back patio completed the already perfect place. The house was also super clean which made us very happy. We were so pleased with how safe the neighborhood was because we didn't know the area prior to staying there. In walking distance to many things. We'll definitely be coming here to stay if ever in the area again.
6565713,38368593,2015-07-15,36661938,Joshua,The host canceled this reservation 102 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

6565713,38631392,2015-07-17,34802514,Kang,"Steven is always very kind and he once came by to say hello to us, the house is also very comfortable, when we stayed in the house, one of the light got broken somehow, it is our responsibility to make up for the loss of Steven cos we rented the house, but Steven is very generous to forgive us and we thank u for everything, Steven."
6565713,38883641,2015-07-19,25483809,Simone,"A warm welcome. The music was playing and the candles were burning. A very nice apartment suitable for five persons.

It was a positive experience for us."

The house was very clean and had plethora if amenities. Everyone who stayed there is planning to stay again when we travel to Boston again. The parking was also really easy."
6565713,39459008,2015-07-23,38834636,David,Steven is a great host.  He welcomed us at the property and quickly ran through all the living-in-instructions then allowing me and my family to enjoy and rest at the property.
Steven's pad is as the photos shown on the website.  Its clean,functional and came with very stylish/rustic furniture.  Especially,the beds were both very comfortable and that gave us a good rest and re-charged for our day time activities exploring Boston.  Parking is easy on the street or nearby garage.  the location is very convenient with grocery stores,pharmacy,pubs,"restaurants within walking distance.  My family and I really enjoy Steven's hospitality home.    We highly recommend this property when planning a trip with family and friends to Boston.\""
6565713,39583038,2015-07-24,39047964,Jacqulyn,My fiancé and I decided last minute to stay in town and Steven was more than accommodating. He responded back to our request right away and also was quick with responding to any questions we messaged him. His place was beautiful and it had everything it said it offered. We drove in and Steven directed us to a parking garage for our car and even offered to take us back to it the next morning! He was relaxed and very welcoming. We will definitely use him again!
6565713,39959819,2015-07-27,1440649,Miryam,"Excellent location, the apartment was perfect for five people and Steve was a very helpful and gracious host, he even had some food in the fridge for us. Everything was very convenient. We had a car so we did not have to take public transportation, we had no problem parking it during the weekend. Highly recommended!"
6565713,40475725,2015-07-31,36078946,Shaun,"Steven was very communicative during our stay. When we got to the place, we were all amazed at how swank and cozy the place was. The best part was the nice and cold AC which gave us a nice oasis in the hot Boston nights! complementary bagels and beer were also a nice touch. Great living room and patio which we took full advantage of as well. We were comfy and relaxed in our Southie pad!"
6565713,40938058,2015-08-03,9428420,Keiko,"Steven's place was great and in a really cute neighborhood. Very convenient, only a 15 minute Uber ride into downtown. A short walk to cafe, restaurants and really nice beach as well!"
Stephen was able to accommodate our early check-in and made us feel very welcome. Speedy communication and he knows the neighborhood very well and was able to recommend parking. His place was super cozy with cable and air-conditioning,"Definitely recommend this!\"",,,,

6565713,41411112,2015-08-07,37515281,Claudine,"Steve is a great host.  He was happy to make his place available early at check in since it was already cleaned from the last visitors.  His place is warm, inviting and charming. We loved the comfort, and decor.  Steve met us when we got there; gave us a tour of the place, and let us know we were allowed to use anything in the kitchen. He has it stocked with drinks, basics, some light breakfast food, and Kurig coffee. I really liked that he had some plastic and travel cups available.  He is comfortable with me texting a question mid-visit.  Washer and dryer available, but we did not use them.  We had a very nice , but too short time there. I'd be happy to stay there again.  I would have liked it to be a little closer to a T stop, but we walked to/from the T a few times, and took the bus once."
6565713,41812451,2015-08-09,38367229,Justin,"We had a great time in South Boston, and Steven was friendly and easy to deal with.  The place was great ... a perfect fit for the three of us and we would certainly stay there again if going back to Boston."

6565713,42576837,2015-08-14,38764037,Priya,Steven was easy to contact. The place was cozy and everything - all appliances worked well. There was even a toy chest for kids. We liked the outdoor space. We just wished we were closer to the city and parking as that made a difference in our plans of walking around in boston vs. driving into the city.
6565713,42892718,2015-08-16,38280206,Elvio,"Steven's place is a real house and it is even better than the posted pictures. We were 5 and we had all the room and the amenities we needed. Kitchen, bathroom, cable TV,  wifi, even Apple tv! Definitely much better than staying in a hotel! A great way to stay in South Boston and feel like at home. Only thing not great is the parking during week nights (only residents). Definitely recommend!!!"
6565713,45102315,2015-08-31,13281869,Kathrin,"We had a very nice stay at Steven's apartment! The space was as described, very nice and clean with a great patio out back. The living space was on the basement level though it did not feel like a basement and two large bedrooms and full bath were located at street level. The beds were very comfortable and the pull out couch was also great to have. Steven was very helpful and allowed us to check in much earlier then expected as we had an early wedding to attend. He was easy to get a hold of through text and made sure the space was very comfortable and clean for our stay. The apartment was within walking distance to shops and restaurants and a quick drive to anything you could ask for. Parking was also super easy as the two hour restrictions did not apply on weekends. Overall we had a great stay at Steven's apartment and would be happy to come back in the future."
6565713,46282093,2015-09-09,38236867,Jeff,"The listing was very accurate and this apartment was perfect for our family of 5.  The location was great in a very safe neighborhood, close to public transportation.  We had a great stay and would highly recommend this as a must stay."

6565713,47272685,2015-09-17,36746937,Kenneth,"The Cozy Bi-level Southie Pad was an awesome experience for me.  It was a very convenient location for my purposes, the pad was large and comfortable and in a great location.  All the amenities I needed were included.  Steven also was very helpful and gracious.  I also was impressed that Steven took a one-night reservation when others refused a one-night reservation when the availability was present."
6565713,47394271,2015-09-18,30183102,Yumiko,"I stayed at Steven's house with my family and we had a great time there. The location was perfect, not so far from South Station.

I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a place to have a good rest in Boston."

6565713,48033917,2015-09-22,24596491,Courtney,"Nice and welcoming! Candles were lit when we walked in. Windows open for fresh air. Nice, clean rooms and kitchen. Some crumbs left on kitchen table but nothing dirty. Bed in smaller bedroom was a little hard and small for two people to fit. The main bedroom bed was very comfortable. Both rooms were wonderfully decorated, as was the rest of the house. Loved the back porch. Would have preferred the house to be closer to the T stop or another area of mass transit but it was about a one mile walk each way. Very safe area, even walking back from the T late at night. Overall, great experience and we would definitely come back and stay here!"
6565713,48887232,2015-09-29,40070293,Denise,"Steven was very welcoming and at ease. Upon arrival he offered to take us to the nearby parking garage. His home was also welcoming, clean and decorated nicely. Location was easy to navigate with public transportation. There was also a grocery store and convenience grocery store within walking distance. Enjoyed the stay and would contact Steven again if visiting Boston."

Because this was their first time in the US, I wanted a place that was spacious, had all the amenities and had shops/pharmacy/etc nearby. Steven's place was perfect on all these dimensions and my parents had a great time. Steven was very thoughtful and gave us a very detailed tour of the apartment. On top of that, Steven was great in dealing with the fact that my parents don't speak English and he helped them out whenever they needed him. All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend Steven's place!"

6565713,80363152,2016-06-17,19234180,Anna,"Steven made us feel very welcome and was very communicative with any questions. The home was very nice and well furnished/decorated. It's located in a great area that's walkable to the main strip of bars, restaurants, and stores. I was in Boston for a work event in the seaport and it was easy to take a cheap Uber ride to work each day. No complaints. The bedroom situation is a bit strange, as you have to walk through the master bedroom to enter/exit the second bedroom, so it was a bit awkward since I was staying with my boss. But if you're staying with friends/family who won't wake up to doors being opened, then it's not a big deal. I would stay here again."

We would definitely return!"

The apartment is perfectly located just off Broadway (with a good selection of bars and coffee shops), 10 minutes walk from the Pleasure Bay beach, and close to bus lines. The place itself is excellent. Very functional but homey, with large rooms, and a great patio. Communication with Steven was flawless. Everything went very smoothly."
6565713,89068674,2016-07-26,54291211,Carla,"Beautiful home! Beds were great. There is lots of space to stretch out, plenty of room for our party of four. Parking is tough, but the neighborhood is great. We would stay here again in a minute. Everything we could of needed was provided. Steven was very easy to deal with. Do watch your step downstairs- there is a raised seating area that we all managed to trip on! Highly recommended!"
6565713,92103072,2016-08-07,1911494,Valerie,"Thank you Steven for a great stay! The apartment was clean, tastefully furnished and in a good location. My family and I enjoyed our stay!"
6565713,93193460,2016-08-11,46297834,Rebecca,"I stayed at the apartment for 4 nights with my family. The apartment was clean and tidy and the beds were very comfortable. We were given clear instructions about how to find the house and when we arrived there was nice music playing and scented candles lit, which was a lovely touch. There are a few restaurants and bars just a five minute walk from the house, which were handy. It is also very easy to get a bus into the centre or wherever else you need to go to. We never actually met Steven but he was quick to reply to messages and I'm sure if there had been any issues he would have been quick to resolve them. The fact that there is only one shower and you have to walk through one of the bedrooms was slightly annoying but it was fine for a few days. All in all a great air b and b experience. Thanks"
6565713,94896930,2016-08-17,82011545,Frederic,"I stayed with my gf and mom in Steves house and it was a perfect stay. We had two floors. The rooms in the upper floor were comfortable and clean. So was the kitchen downstairs, with everything we needed. At our arrival we found coffee, milk and water and all basics in the fridge. Not everybody does that. The host, Steve, was super friendly. He was so nice to drive us on our last day to the airport. Perfect stay! Thanks. I strongly recommend!"
6565713,95388194,2016-08-19,9056166,Andrea,Very beautiful place! Well kept and easy communication with the host
6565713,96804046,2016-08-24,1716810,Pierre,Everything was as pictured.  Easy to find and coordinate the keys etc.  Steve was great in ensuring everything went smoothly.
9343915,74181144,2016-05-13,67164451,Ewan,We had a great time in the apartment. It felt really safe and was very clean and how we expected it to be. We had clear instructions of how to get in and all worked out great. The location was fantastic and would highly recommend
6780300,38767513,2015-07-18,36940147,Michael,Emma was a phenomenal and thoughtful host. Very easy to communicate with and quick to respond to questions. I was silly enough to leave a pair of shoes at her place after I left and she was kind enough to make it very easy to me to retrieve them. The description is accurate and it was an easy walk to the nearby Orange line T stop.
6780300,39539581,2015-07-24,14110064,Ahmet,"We had a pleasant stay in Boston. Emma is a good host. Room is okay for young people who are not demandong. Kitchen can be used as well. Approximately 15 min to the city center, 10min walk to the next station."
6780300,40141032,2015-07-28,35061359,Jacqueline,The room was very nice and there was enough space for 2 persons (and it looks exactly as shown on the picture). The location of the apartment is very convenient and the city is easy to reach. Emma was very friendly and answered our questions always very fast. Thank you Emma for letting us stay in your apartment.
6780300,49839849,2015-10-06,5642757,Ilona,"The listing was very accurate. Emma sent me separate instructions regarding my stay after I booked, which made things easy. I had to get in contact with her twice during my stay and she was very responsive and helpful. I enjoyed the neighborhood because I usually stay in the Downtown area, so the change was welcome. The common areas were a bit messy, but the restroom and my room were totally clean."
6780300,52114885,2015-10-26,44693289,Abed,"The experience i had was fabulous! I had originally booked for 3 days instead of 4, by mistake, and when i landed in boston i discovered that i had not booked that same day. However emma was very understanding and helpful and allowed me to book that extra day on a short notice. Basically she accommodated me last second and for that i am very grateful!"
6780300,53188610,2015-11-06,13496993,Tegan,"The place was clean and as described. I never met Emma and it was never clear whose apartment I was in or who else was there, which was a little unsettling. It was conveniently located."
6780300,54712824,2015-11-23,44963311,Juliette,"The room was very comfortable, and Emma was very quick to respond helpfully to any questions we had!"
6780300,56225361,2015-12-10,50635488,Spiro,"Overall, the experience was as-expected. Emma was very communicative, and the stay was very smooth. Thank you Emma for coordinating the stay!"
6780300,98616417,2016-08-31,47724999,Mariana,"I stayed at Emma's place for 6 months and had an excellent experience. Emma was a very accommodating host, and communicating with her was very quick and easy. She would respond to all of my texts and questions within about 5 minutes, and was always polite and friendly. I even locked myself out once, and she responded to my call late at night to try to help me deal with the problem. She was even polite when I moved some of the furniture out of my room, and had to ask me to put it back so it didn't take up too much space. When she asked me to do this, she was very respectful and friendly, even though it was my mistake."
In addition,the room that I stayed in was very pretty. It was quite large,fully furnished and decorated nicely. The rest of apartment was also fully furnished,with a pleasant little sitting area and breakfast table. The kitchen was stocked with a toaster,electric kettle,silverware
My only issue was with the other guests occasionally leaving piles of dishes in the sink,or not tossing their garbage before they checked out,but that isn't Emma's fault. She even posted signs in the room reminding people to clean up after themselves,some guests just ignored it. She would also text them reminders to clean up. If you stay here,please clean up after yourself!,
The apartment is in a convenient location. There are two small convenience stores within a minute walk,a subway,and a Papa John's. It's also about a 7-10 minute walk to the nearest orange line stations (Massachusetts Avenue and Ruggles). The Symphony green line station is about a 10-12 minute walk. There is also a lot of food about 10 minutes from the apartment (on Huntington Avenue and Massachusetts Avenue). The laundromat I always went to is about 15 minutes away.,,,
I would highly recommend this airbnb to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Boston! Good luck with everything,"Emma!\"",,,,
646087,80422316,2016-06-18,24498892,Derrick,I spent three nights here while attending a conference in the Seaport District. My flight was delayed and Ingrid was kind enough to wait up for me to show me around. We didn't see much of each other but I always found breakfast waiting for me each morning. The house was clean and the room was private since it had a bathroom adjacent. I would definitely stay again.

13810937,86202756,2016-07-15,12351225,Bryan,Jay was a great host that was quick to respond to any question I had. He was also very accommodating to greeting me and helping me get settled into Boston. Thanks Jay!
13810937,86726198,2016-07-17,757632,Niels,"Visit Jay in the spring, fall, or winter. July with no AC is ... warm but not unbearable with the window fan, which was nice. Jay is a very gracious host though and the location is great!"
472070,67356005,2016-03-28,21360777,Chirag,"The apartment was in fantastic location, was exactly as described and the rooftop deck was a real treat! There is no elevator and the apartment is at the top of the stairs but its only 3 flights of stairs, only a concern if you plan on having multiple large, heavy suitcases."
"Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.\"",,,,,
472070,72682489,2016-05-04,1149249,Jenn,"the space was great, as was the location. everything was as described. would definitely stay here again on a future trip."
472070,81841550,2016-06-25,191557,Tom,"It is in a perfect location - easy to walk to everything. The place had an amazing balcony, we had our meal outside."
The place is a serviced apartment,NOT your typical AirBNB ( No one lives there). That was good! The smoke alarm went out and they had a 24 hour maintenance person there and replaced it. We didnt lose any sleep,nor  did the whole building.,,,
The kitchen was reasonably stocked for any of your cooking requirements,and there is a Trader Joe's just a few blocks away.,,,,

He is a true gentleman, was very nice to us and helpful with our stay for places to go. Everything was clean, neat and tidy, and in a perfect location within walking distance to things. I would recommend"
"His home. \"",,,,,
4718577,32843520,2015-05-22,22499508,Kevin,"Can't beat a great first impression. A warm, welcoming and comfortable room and living room - tons of old world charm.   The hospitality was great - Matto dialed the friendly engagement and conversation with enough private time to be just right. If you've never living in an old house you should know that it's normal for all the charm to come with a few compromises on modern details on fit and finish or the walk up, but all what you would anticipate if you love old places. The location is fantastic. Shops, cafes, restaurants. Easy walk to the commons and all Beacon Hill has to offer."
"\"",,,,,
4718577,33524231,2015-05-29,3334142,Marie,"I really enjoyed my stay at Matteo's apartment in Beacon Hill. Matteo was a great host - very friendly and helpful. The apartment was perfectly located, right off Beacon Hill. The private room was comfortable. The shared living room and bathroom were nice. The apartment was well decorated and cozy. Overall, a wonderful stay and would highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a private room in a shared apartment. The location was truly unbeatable!"
4718577,34167960,2015-06-05,2445927,Ryan,"Location. Location. Location. Charles St. is one of my favorite streets in Boston, and this place is convenient to everything. Didn't get to meet Matteo as he was out of town, but his roommates were warm and welcoming. Would definitely stay here again."

4718577,44728117,2015-08-28,41830196,Michael,"Pretty chill. Was there for 2 weeks, no problems. In a pretty cool area of Beacon Hill with all these little shops. I was able to walk downtown to work in 20 minutes through Boston Common, very nice walk in the morning. Matteo and roommate Dana were very nice. Didn't see them much because they were working a lot and I was working a lot too. Enjoyed the stay."
4718577,46221737,2015-09-08,10961854,Julien,"The apartment is very well located in a very attractive and quiet neighbourhood ! You will be very close to Boston Garden, downtown, and many other place to visit."
The subway station was 5 minutes from walk.,,,,,
Matteo wasn't there but his roommate Dana was there to give us the keys and welcome us in the apartment. She was very responsive and nice with us!,,,,,
The apartment is at it is described in the profile : nice,clean and comfortable.,,,,

4718577,82036598,2016-06-26,74007222,Andrew,"Matteo's place was great: clean, quiet, and in a super charming and conveniently accessible part of the city. He was a consistently great host during the multiple weeks of my stay."
2776143,11979788,2014-04-20,13378170,Litia,There's no denying that the space is small but that's well advertised. The room was perfect for our little group and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The location is great and Sean was accommodating and easy to get a hold of!
2776143,12192684,2014-04-25,1452181,Demetrius,"I've stayed with Sean twice now, almost three times, and each time Sean is a clear communicator, flexible and accommodating with travel plan changes."
This apartment is amazingly located and comfortable. I slept quite well each night and for a short stay,two nights,"it was perfect. I'd recommend Sean and this apartment to anyone coming into Boston for a quick trip.  \"",,,
2776143,12258212,2014-04-27,14419037,Joe,"Sean was very good at communicating and even met us at the T station when we were in late from our flight. The room met our needs for the quick visit we had and the wireless internet helped us plan our day. If you're grossed out by old dingy bathtub and dusty blinds in the windows, this is not for you. We understood what we were getting into and we got what we paid for. Great neighborhood and bed/linens were clean, so we don't have any complaints. Loved being this close to the Commons for convenience."
2776143,12470199,2014-05-03,5481821,Peter,"This is good basic accommodation, like a bachelor apartment for a student.  Clean, good linens.  Great value.  Great location, close to everything.  Good restaurants and groceries nearby.  Fruidge stive meant we didn't eat out all the time.  Sean communicates quickly and clearly.  It's not the Ritz, but it's nor $1,000's a night!"
2776143,12851830,2014-05-12,14747801,Judith,The host was please although it felt as if I were inconveniencing him
2776143,12952210,2014-05-15,11154359,Louise,"Ce logement très bien situé et plutôt confortable est très adapté pour un séjour court. Assez minimaliste, nous avons toutefois été satisfaites de notre expérience là-bas et nous la recommandons. Sean est réactif et fiable."
2776143,13146179,2014-05-20,1820750,Eric,Awesome stay very convenient
2776143,13292830,2014-05-24,15584375,Joe,"Sean was an excellent host- quick to respond & available when we needed. He gave us pointers on exploring Boston & let us use his bike- both were much appreciated! The apartment is in a great location, easy to get to from the airport (a few blocks from the Blue Line subway), & had what we needed. We would stay here again in the future."
2776143,13358585,2014-05-26,9268763,Tamara,It was a nice and cozy room enough space for 3 people. Sean was a great host! And it was no problem to check in late. Would love to rent from him again
2776143,13673036,2014-06-02,2149824,Peter,"Sean's apartment is a true Boston experience you would definitely love. Do not expect 5star Ritz or Hilton, you will feel Boston's famous Beacon hill at it's best! Definitely recommend for those who have the hunger for unusual experience!"
2776143,13917864,2014-06-08,14803610,Jeremy,"The place was exactly what we expected from previous reviews. It was clean, but small and older. 4 of us stayed here fine as we spent just sleeping hours in the apartment. The apartment is in a fantastic location about 4 blocks from the nearest T station and close to Beacon Hill and the Boston Common. Excellent place for the money."
2776143,14122857,2014-06-12,7432148,Aaron,"My wife and I had a great experience staying at Sean's apartment.  The neighborhood is quiet but right in the heart of downtown Boston.  Very easy access to the North End, Freedom Trail, waterfront, and lots of other sites.  The apartment itself was no frills, but clean and provided everything one needs for a short stay.  The pictures are true to the actual space."
2776143,14276969,2014-06-16,14370920,Wilson,Room was as described and perfect for my needs in terms of a place to stay for a few nights.  Great location in the city made it easy to walk to many metro stations and major sightseeing spots.  I would have preferred if there was a small table to lay down my computer and for basic dining in.
2776143,14380957,2014-06-17,16744767,Caitlin,"Had a great stay here! Sean was a good host. He was really gracious about accommodating our schedule. The space had everything we needed and was very clean, but nothing fancy. Awesome location."
2776143,14400746,2014-06-18,5803111,Stephanie,"Perfect location! It's in a really darling neighborhood. The apartment is an older place, but it was very clean, and perfect for us, we were out all day and mainly just used it to sleep and shower. There's one bed, and a mattress on the floor if you have more than 2 people, which worked just fine for us. My only critique is that we asked if we could leave our luggage in the apartment for a few extra hours before we checked out so we could spend some extra time in the city without lugging our bags, but couldn't get ahold of Sean that morning. Overall a good experience!"
2776143,14514627,2014-06-21,15017199,Dick,"This space was appropriate for us, as we essentially just used it for sleeping at night.  It's inexpensive and suitable for a  short bare bones trip.  It is not the place for a romantic getaway! Although very small, it was in a terrific location where not many options are available.  I would consider staying here again depending on what I was doing in Boston."
2776143,14617337,2014-06-23,3113302,Brendan,Sean's place was just what we needed. The neighborhood is really nice. Thanks Sean.
2776143,15036623,2014-07-01,12738569,Lori,We had a good stay at Sean's place.  The place was clean and the AC window unit worked well. It is a tight squeeze with 4 people but since 2 of them were children it was fine. Our only complaint is that he left only 2 towels for four people.
We loved the neighborhood.  It was also close (but not too close) to a main road where there were restaurants,"a grocery store and a drug store etc. It took us less than 10 minutes to walk to Boston Common. We loved Boston and were glad to be able to stay at an affordable place downtown. \"",,,,
2776143,15124499,2014-07-02,3335220,Cristina,"We never met the host in person but we kept in touch trough texts. Everything was there. The listing was exactly what I expected. Small room, fairly priced , great location. Me and my husband went to a concert to TD Garden and we just had to walk 15 min. The apartment is close to downtown, park, stores, train."
2776143,15148756,2014-07-03,11937121,Danica,The apartment is in a wonderful location and convenient for accessing the T.

Notre contact avec Sean Cummings a été très bref,5 mn à l'arrivée pour nous conduire à la chambre,2 mn à la remise des clefs,au cours desquelles il s'est montré très souriant.,,
"Nous même n'avons fait aucun commentaire ni exprimé notre désagrément .\"",,,,,
2776143,15830340,2014-07-16,16778112,Rick,Only stayed a few hours and got up for a red-eye. We thought the bed was comfy. Sean was very nice and met us at the curb later in the evening.
2776143,15926812,2014-07-18,16926753,Rhys,"Wonderful! Can't say enough how much I loved having a little apartment in this neighborhood for a day. It's beautiful, and I miss it already. There's a little Taqueria on the corner, coffee across the street, and the most beautiful brick sidewalk/ vine overgrown neighborhood. Lovely."
2776143,16343524,2014-07-26,15293294,Liesbeth,"The place of Sean is situated very well in Boston. It is a great neighbourhoud. Sean is a very friendly host. The room is a cramped for a family of four, but for a few nights it is ok. The room is very clean. Parking is expensive during the day. When you are from The Netherlands: ask if you can see 'de bakfiets' from Shaun."
2776143,16410928,2014-07-27,369186,Mike,"You know what they say about first impressions. Despite a relatively late check in, 4 p.m., as well as keeping Sean informed as to our arrival, the apartment was not ready. Sean did not prepare us for this he merely opened the door to let us in and to view an unmade bed which had obviously just been slept in, an overflowing waste basket filled with garbage in the kitchen area, dirty towels and a filthy bathtub in the bathroom. No apology was offered he simply walked over to look for the keys which were left behind then started to clean the garbage. We left to give him time to get the place in order, still no apology for the condition of the apartment as we left. Upon our return the garbage had been emptied there were fresh linens however the tub did not look like it has been cleaned."
The apartment looks way better in photos than it does in person however it is in a great location. For the money I would probably stay here again if I were by myself however not if my wife was with me.,,,,,
Both check in and check out did not seem well thought out considering the number of times is done it . He did not give his apartment number and apparently the landlord where he lives has not updated the apartment list on the mailbox for over 1 year so we had to call him,this can be a real problem for someone coming from another country no phone service in the US . Upon checkout he asked me how I was going to get the keys back to him??,,,,
Sean seems like a nice enough guy however given the amount of experience he has renting his apartment I found he should buy now be a little more rehearsed in his routine. Perhaps charge an extra $25 and get a professional to come in and clean in between guest,"at least have someone knock the dust off the fan over the bed (hasn't been done in years by the looks of it). We've stayed at many Airbnb locations and this one definitely ranks at the bottom of the list.\"",,,,
2776143,16706662,2014-08-01,14452938,Theresa,"Location, location, location!  Overall happy with experience.   I traveled with my 8 year old daughter and the rental was the perfect size for us, and close to several T stops.  Sean was great about communications prior to trip so that I felt comfortable with rental, and was available for additional towels during our time spent there."
2776143,16857174,2014-08-03,6968560,Joanna,"Sean's place is in an excellent location, right on Beacon Hill and easy distances to everything. The place itself was pretty basic and spartan, nothing fancy, but we were only there a night and weren't really using it for more than sleeping, so it worked well enough for us."
2776143,16908827,2014-08-04,11079751,Christiane,"Very centrally located therefore a little noisy at night, floor was a bit dirty, parts of bath tub was rusty, towels were stained.  We thought breakfast was included and must have misread description.  Starbucks located 2 minutes walk away which was great."
2776143,17091034,2014-08-07,11491952,Laurie,"Wow! Incredible bargain. Where else can you find an efficiency plus wifi for this price and location? I stayed with my 3 year old son and we easily walked to Boston Common and Public Garden, the Bowdoin stop on the T, restaurants and coffee on Cambridge St, the running path and playgrounds along the Charles, the Aquarium (he was in the jogging stroller for the latter two). Whole Foods is across the street where we stocked up on a few groceries for the fridge. Sean was very flexible in meeting times for key pick up and drop off. I arrived a day later than expected and Sean had no problem with the last minute change. The room was ready to go with fresh linens and towels. The slight downsides of the apartment are: the street noise (easily drowned out with the window unit AC running); the lack of table to eat at; the dirty toilet. However, it was easy for me to overlook those considering the price and convenience of the place. This spot would be perfect for any travelers wanting to experience Boston and not feel like obvious tourists."
2776143,17433685,2014-08-12,14941683,Mykell,The location is awesome!  The listing is just as Sean describes.  This was a nice home base for our tour of Boston colleges.  Sean was easy to work with.
2776143,17619036,2014-08-15,13699646,Suzanne,Sean est sympathique et se met au service de ses locataires. L'appartement très bien situé par contre vieillot et limite au niveau de la propreté...
2776143,17822731,2014-08-18,1178161,Dan,Very convenient location; accurate description.  Large room with all conveniences.
2776143,17927245,2014-08-19,13502034,Patricia,"Sean met us at his place, just around the corner from the apartment.  He had emailed us detailed directions on how to get there. He then took us to the apartment and made sure we were settled, and answered all our questions."
This apartment was very good for what we were looking for,a one night stay in a central location in Boston close to the T while we stayed over between an international flight and a connecting bus ride the next day.  The apartment was in a safe location,was clean and comfortable for a short stay,"and met all our requirements. We happily recommend it.\"",,
2776143,18051532,2014-08-21,4839890,Meng,"Very nice person,and good location. One thing is the window can't close.but for summer it is ok."
2776143,18164166,2014-08-23,12497222,Solenn,"Very simple, but it suits us well for one night (2 adults and 2 kids)."
Very well located,in the lovely Beacon Hill!,,,,
Close to many things to visit,15 minutes walk from good italian restaurants and 2 minutes from a supermarket.,,,,
"Sean was really reactive to come back to give us the keys in the afternoon and easy to communicate.\"",,,,,
2776143,18397563,2014-08-26,10968515,Matthias,"Great place to stay when you're in Boston: good location, fully equipped, quiet street and still close enough to city centre to walk everywhere you want. Sean is a supernice guy, very helpful and friendly. I can fully recommend staying at his place"
"\"",,,,,
2776143,18529106,2014-08-28,16512468,Chris,"Pre-trip arrangements went smoothly and Sean was there to welcome us. The location was excellent. In less than 10 minutes we could access Charles/MGH on the Red line for easy access to South Station and Harvard, Bowdoin on the Blue line for easy access to Boston Logan and Boston Common for the Freedom Trail. The cobblestone streets and lamps give the neighbourhood character. The apartment was clean, basic and tidy.  We found the mattress comfortable to sleep on and the shower pressure was very good. The wifi was fast and the ceiling fan kept the temperature comfortable but there was also an air conditioner. Sean's place represents value for money for independent people who plan to spend most of their time exploring Boston."
2776143,18647948,2014-08-30,15066398,Jim,"Sean was indeed the gracious host and we enjoyed our visit. The location is convenient but if you are renting a car, it is necessary to make parking arrangements beforehand (we took the train). Beacon Hill parking space is at a high premium and excellent parallel parking skills are needed."
2776143,18867149,2014-09-01,20722197,Maggie,"Sean was very responsive and accommodating.  The location was perfect and walking distance to everything.  It was great that check in and check out times were flexible so that you could drop off everything, grab a cannoli, and come back to a room that's ready for the night."
2776143,19074306,2014-09-06,1561694,Erin,"Sean was very accommodating. The room was exactly what we needed and he was flexible in terms of our arrival and departure time. As a commuting college professor from NY, I'll definitely be staying at Sean's different listings!!"
2776143,19313896,2014-09-10,12272180,Addie,The place had everything we need. Simple accommodation but comfortable with everything you need and in a great location. Sean was easy to contact and always replied quickly.
2776143,19405565,2014-09-12,15500320,Nico Le,Sean's room is clean and warm. This place has a good location. It's so convenient for us to go the downtown and subway station.
2776143,19510793,2014-09-14,14672563,Marion,"There seems to have been a problem of communication between Sean and us. We told him we would arrive at the meeting place between 11:30 and noon, but at noon Sean wasn't here and we had to call him, which was not very handy for us because calling abroad is expensive for us. I thought he would just meet us out front at the given time. Then he led us to the apartment but the previous occupants were still there, and they intended to stay a bit more, while we just wanted to get some rest because we had just had a 3-hour drive to get to Boston. When they said that, Sean didn't tell them that they needed to leave, and even when they did, the apartment obviously still needed to be cleaned, the sheets changed, etc. So we couldn't really get some rest. When we came back, the apartment was very clean so that was nice, but the bed was undone, which was sort of annoying. Then on the day we left, we told him we would leave at noon, but again, he didn't show up to take the keys back and didn't tell us what we needed to do to check out."
Sean says on his airbnb profile that he likes to talk with the people he hosts,but it didn't really feel that way with us...,,,,
Now the place itself is OK,clean and comfortable although it's a bit small. The neighborhood is very quiet so that's good,but the fridge is very noisy and it's right by the bed. There is a Starbuck's and a Au Bon Pain just round the corner,which is convenient for breakfast,"and a lot of great restaurants on Charles St within a few minutes walking distance.\"",
2776143,19600125,2014-09-15,12468544,Katharina,"Boston made the calulation of our arrival time not very easy due to the traffic, but Sean was very patient and nice and everything went smoothly. The appartement was like discribed and the neighbourhood was extremely beautiful and worth to visit. It is perfectly located to start the freedom trail and to explore the city."
2776143,19672210,2014-09-16,12187116,Tricie,"The apt was exactly as described, and the neighborhood was great. Nice restaurants, a grocery store, and subway stations a short walk away.  Great casual place to spend the night.  The host was easy to contact, and helped us out with a personal problem that came up.  All in all, a great experience!"
2776143,19767525,2014-09-18,14596184,Lina,The apartment was exactly as described. Besides Beacon Hill is amazing and very central. We just once used the metro.
My mates and I had a wonderful stay at Seans apartment.,,,,,
Sean was very helpful,uncomplicated and kind.,,,,

2776143,19921894,2014-09-21,12553365,Dawn,"This apartment is in a fantastic location and is just as described. Sean was very accommodating and happy to let us check in at 11 pm, which was when our Amtrak train finally arrived. We would be glad to stay here if we ever get to visit Boston again."
2776143,20012064,2014-09-22,12193565,Marco,Sean was a very good host. I recommend fot those who are looking for a nice place in Boston.
2776143,20180014,2014-09-25,13185200,Alexis,"Our stay at Sean's place was really good. The condo is perfectly located on Beacon Hill, near whatever you need in Boston (parks, shops, cafes etc). On the other hand, it is kind of small, we slept 3 but I'm not sure the appartement can satisfies more. The price for a single room plus bath seems high but the city is kind of expensive so it's no big deal. Sean was totally helpful, he provided everything we could need and we never had a problem. To recommand !"
2776143,20276630,2014-09-27,16559383,Petra,"Beacon Hill ist wirklich ein sehr schönes Viertel und sehr zentral gelegen. Das Zimmer ist funktional und hatte ein bequemes Bett. Schön war es, dass wir unser Gepäck im Appartement bis zur Abreise stehen lassen konnten. Ein Minuspunkt für das Appartement war allerdings die  Sauberkeit. Dafür ist der Preis das Appartement in Beacon Hill wirklich gut."
2776143,20947566,2014-10-08,17892139,Erica,The studio was just as described.  It is in a great location.

The place is exactly as described. It was good for what we needed to do.  We were only there,for the most part to sleep.  Location is great. Right by the red line and walking distance of lots of great Boston stuff.,,,,
"Water pressure was great.  Space was small. Bed was comfortable. \"",,,,,
2776143,21121197,2014-10-12,14907738,Lynda,"Sean was very helpful with information about the booking, responded quickly to my questions and gave excellent instructions for options of getting from the airport to the address.  He was accommodating to me and my mother, and then the addition of my sister for the last night. Right in the heart of Beacon Hill, and central to everything in Boston.   As a 50ish active traveller with minimal needs, this was perfect.  But I had my 84 year old mother with me, and it was difficult for her to get up the hill (just one short block) and navigate the cobblestones sidewalks, and even difficult for her to climb the 6 steep steps to the first floor room.   A challenge although she agreed we were situated in a perfect spot in the city for access to everything."
2776143,21201630,2014-10-13,13523111,Liz,"The Beacon Hill listing is totally accurate, so if you're expecting a 5-room on-suite, you are not looking at the description correctly! It was perfect for the two of us; we stayed on 2 non-consecutive nights. We had a tricky schedule because of this, and Sean was totally accommodating with all my requests."
The neighborhood is quite posh,and there are all these quaint streets and adorable little parks. We walked almost everywhere,including to the North End. Multiple T stops are always around the corner,though probably up a hill,"so this might not be the best place for those uncomfortable with uneven brick layed sidewalks.\"",
2776143,21276816,2014-10-14,2298883,Rosie,"Sean's place was in the perfect location, easy to find and such a nice area. We stayed for one night and it had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend!"

2776143,21660864,2014-10-21,8918420,David J,Sean was very welcoming and we got into the place at our scheduled time. This a great deal for a room in one the most beautiful neighborhoods in North America.
2776143,21869044,2014-10-26,17694870,Paul,"Sean was helpful in adjusting to my last minute change to the expected arrival time due to a cancelled flight, and was also knowledgeable about architecture in the local area."
The location of the accommodation was exceptional for its price,"with various historical sites within close proximity.\"",,,,
2776143,22057831,2014-10-29,6229534,Sandra,"\"First, let me give you a little context for my review.  My bf and I took a week long trip to New England.  We spent 3 nights in Boston, traveled to New Hampshire for the next 3 nights, and then returned to Boston for the last 2 nights of our trip.  For the time we spent in Boston, we ended up booking 2 of Sean's listings  because of the cheap prices and excellent location; We booked \"\"On Beacon Hill: Shaker"
In the weeks leading up to our trip,we kept in contact with Sean through AirBnB's messaging system,scheduling our check-in time and getting more info about the room and amenities.  Upon arriving in Boston,"we checked in at Sean's \"\"On Beacon Hill: Shaker","Not Stirred\"\" just after noon as agreed upon.",
The room was not cleaned when we arrived.  While we chatted with Sean,he emptied the trash,did a quick sweep of the floor with a dust pan and brush,and then replaced the sheets on the bed while we went to grab lunch.  Because we left,I am not sure if he cleaned anything else.  However,the toilet and sink were not cleaned.  There was visible
We found the listing to be in a great location and the price to be very cheap compared to just about everywhere else we looked.  We suggest that you bring your own towels and disinfecting wipes,and be prepared to do a little light cleaning and possibly some laundry.  For the price,we believe it was worth it for the money we saved,the nice neighborhood,and easy access to Boston's attractions.,
For our second stay in Boston,we booked another room with Sean,which he said was in the same building.  An hour before check-in,we received an email from AirBnN indicating that Sean had canceled our reservation.  I texted him about the matter and he replied about 20-30 minutes later saying that the room was not ready.  The cancellation caused us some anxiety and wasted a couple hours of our time,but AirBnB sorted it out and put us up in a fairly nice hotel for no additional cost.,
Overall,"our bookings with Sean was a bit of a mixed bag.  Sean seems pleasant and was responsive but not entirely reliable.  The room was basically as promised though not thoroughly cleaned.\"",,,,
2776143,22136556,2014-10-31,19446699,Nicki,"I came here with 3 friends for a conference nearby and couldn't ask for a better location (and price!) We arrived to a very cozy little apartment and it was as we expected. Do note that with the second bed pulled out it is hard to fit much else in, but that was ok with us as we spent so little time there. If you are arriving by transit, it's a good idea to note you have a bit of an uphill walk with your luggage!"
2776143,22424652,2014-11-06,6863472,J Alexander,"Right in the middle of Beacon Hill. Beautiful neighborhood, intimate streets and hills. A quick walk to Charles St and you will feel the great vibe of this place."

The apartment is simple and as described in the listing, was perfect for what we needed, the neighborhood is fantastic, walking distance to basically all of the historical sites and restaurants and pubs and so so pretty."
2776143,22758469,2014-11-14,18155033,Anke,"Sean described very accurately how to reach him to obtain the keys.  He accompanied us and saw to the orderliness of the apartment and pointed us to the closest supermarket in walking distance.  He chatted about his plans and explained about some of the places of post secondary education in and and around Boston, which we found very interesting."

2776143,23613327,2014-12-06,98730,Malene,Sean is friendly and accommodating. I arrived late in the evening and left later in the morning the following day and had no problem getting and returning the keys.
2776143,23676553,2014-12-08,19986169,Jon,"Sean was an excellent host! He was very responsive to our initial request (answered within minutes). While he was a little more difficult to get a hold of the two days before the trip, he was very responsive the day of which is all you really need (my girlfriend and I are quite the planners). The apartment is exactly what it looks like on the profile. A little small, but comfortable for two people to stay which is all we needed to sleep. Not bad of a little kitchen too if you want to put something together quick. The absolute best part - it is close to three different Ts! It was honestly so convenient and was located in an amazing area!"
Only small thing was that the room room was a bit dry at night. It was very chilly outside when we visited,so the heat was on. The temperature was very comfortable,so I'd take being a little dry over being cold during the night.,,,

Both times Sean met us late. 1st time we left a favorite toy of my daughter's and Sean let us know and offered to mail it back before we even realized it was missing. 2nd trip we needed some help with the heater and Sean came immediately (early in the morning) and helped us figure out the problem and the apartment was nice and comfortable the rest of the trip.

The accommodation is very conveniently situated on Beacon Hill, a late 19th century part of Boston redolent of the history of the city. The room was simple, warm and comfortable (especially the Shaker Bed) in a very cold January weather spell outside. My partner forgot his tie and Sean was very helpful in letting us know that he had found it!"
2776143,25765396,2015-01-25,149910,Beki,"Sean was a big help to us in figuring out how to pass our time in Boston and also in identifying how and where to park, which can be tricky.  We scored a free, visitor spot right near the apartment, so we lucked out.  The apartment is warm and cozy with their personal touches on the furniture and the peg board.  It is in a great neighborhood, too.  My daughter and I felt comfortable walking to a nearby bakery late in the evening while we were there.  Sean's place is casual and so is he, which was a perfect match for our Boston visit."

2776143,26382965,2015-02-10,1708665,Lindsay & Jonathan,"Sean was super helpful during my stay in Boston. He was really flexible with letting me come a day earlier due to the storms in Boston so I wouldn't miss my interview. The Shaker apartment was a bit dusty and not entirely clean (which probably had a lot to do with me arriving a day early); it was also reallllyyy cold (again probably to do with the snow storms) but the apartment could've used some extra heating help. Finally, the stove wasn't working which bummed me out because I went shopping to cook myself meals before I realized the stove wasn't working, and with the storms, nearby restaurants weren't open either, so no dinner my first night. To be fair, I was exhausted and didn't bother to let Sean know when I realized this. Had I informed Sean, I am certain he would've come by to take a look ASAP. I moved to the other studio in the same building for the rest of my stay and enjoyed this apartment much more. It was cleaner, brighter, cozier, and warmer. I got to interact with Sean a fair amount during my stay and have to say he is a really nice and interesting guy. I also learned that his wife made most of the furniture in the Shaker apartment which blew my mind because the pieces in that apartment were so beautiful!!! Thanks Sean for being such a helpful host!"
2776143,26431343,2015-02-12,26672266,Bernadette,Great location. I had appointments at Mass Gen Hosp and this was an ideal location.
The room is small and needs some attention! There was  a lovely,but impractical bed. We bumped our shins getting in and out. There is one chair- not sure how people manage to eat in this room.  The room needs a good cleaning,another chair,and some rugs! We used the towels  because the hardwood floors were cold and wet from the mountains of snow on thte street.,,

2776143,26664329,2015-02-16,11358959,Parth,"\"My girlfriend and I have stayed at a few Airbnbs in the past and always had a good experience. This one, unfortunately, was not one of those cases. We actually did not even end up staying in the room listed so can't speak to the cleanliness/coziness or anything regarding that. However, overall the entire experience was somewhat miserable. We were delayed on getting to the place due to a winter storm in Boston, arrived at the place which was on a poorly shoveled street. We could not find the key he had left for us and because we were already short on time, we left for an event we had planned with all our luggage. After the event, we learned that the MBTA would be closed the following day due to the snow emergency and we communicated to the host that we would not be able to stay that night due to the closing of the public transportation, effectively getting us stuck in Boston. To my surprise he was inconsiderate and non accommodating. Sean seemed like a nice guy from the reviews, and that is why I booked this place to begin with. However this was not the case at all. Sean did not offer to accommodate us in this predicament, instead, he started to blame us for poor planning, threatening to not refund his portion of the room, which we found ridiculous since we did not even stay there. Bottom line is Sean could have been a little more understanding in this particular situation. Based on my experience I personally would not recommend any of my friends/family booking with this host, as he did not \"\"host\"\" us well in my opinion and did not make our Valentine's Day snow troubles any simpler."
"On a good note I applaud Airbnb customer service who actually understood our situation and were able to resolve the issue very quickly. \"",,,,,
2776143,27312211,2015-03-01,3695323,Ruth,"Sean was accommodating when I made a somewhat last minute reservation, with a flight arriving at 1:00am.  I found the keys and got into the flat with no problems at all.  He also let me leave my suitcase with him the next day after I checked out.  The apartment itself is fairly  plain, but totally functional.  It's not fancy, but it's also quite affordable, which is what I was looking for."
2776143,27380357,2015-03-02,14242690,Taylor,"Everything was wonderful! Sean took the time to give us advice about where to eat. The location is right across the street from Whole Foods, which is nice."
2776143,27554187,2015-03-07,28288115,Jennifer,"Rustic studio super conveniently located in quiet, safe, historic neighborhood. Quick and scenic walk to subway, shops, restaurants, etc.  Sean was easy to reach and provided everything I needed."
2776143,27793145,2015-03-12,1118027,David,"The room is set in a beautiful, quiet area. However our experience was not good. Sean had initially said he would meet us at his address around the corner. He did not acknowledge either of my two emails sent in the week previous. On arrival he was not there. We finally made contact via 'phone. He gave instructions for finding keys and where the flat was located. He promised to provide the bed linen later."
The room was disappointing. It was small and only superficially clean.,,,,,
The duvet cover did not arrive. The wifi did not work on the codes given. The refrigerator,very close to the bed,the plumbing and laundry room noises kept us awake most of that night.,,,
By chance the next day we met Sean and asked for the duvet cover which he later put on the bed. On request,he also removed the half a pizza from the refrigerator. He also provided the correct wifi log in which was different to the one given.,,,,
The room is small and very basic. The kitchen area is very close to the bed. There was plenty of really hot water and the room was very warm and the bed comfortable. The bathroom was small with a shower that worked well.,,,,,
Finding space for the second bed would prove an interesting. challenge!,,,,,
On our second night we had great difficulty getting into the apartment block as the inner door lock was broken. It was fixed the following day.,,,,,
We felt the pictures and description to be misleading. it is smaller and in need of much more attention than is described.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2776143,27862189,2015-03-13,4693759,Maya,"Great place! Nice, clean and stocked with essentials. Grateful lot for acccomodating my short notice and early check out time!"
2776143,28158237,2015-03-19,23583657,Jen,Pros:
Good location,near two subway stops (blue and red lines),restaurants,and grocery/drug stores,in a safe neighborhood.,
It was nice to have a kitchen with a fridge,stove,and microwave in the apartment as well as a washing machine and dryer in the basement ($1 each per load).,,,
The shower pressure was good,which is always a plus.,,,,
Wifi was fast.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
It definitely could have been cleaner and could have used a few more extras (bathroom hand towel and soap,kitchen towels).,,,,
"Difficult to park if you don't want to pay for an expensive garage. Only a few street spots available and the one we found was only for 7pm-7am so we had to wake up very early for our day trip!\"",,,,,
2776143,28548719,2015-03-25,4140395,Anmol,"This space is very cool, and the location is amazing. The hosts designed and built all the furniture themselves. There's a small bathroom and kitchen with cooking utensils if needed. The whole space is a very cozy, small and dark efficiency, so it's best for people looking to crash after a day of sightseeing or in town for work. The neighborhood is incredible, Sean was super nice and informative."
2776143,28599144,2015-03-27,21089442,Bjorn,Sean was a good host who provided everything I needed.   The listing is accurate and the neighborhood and location is great.
2776143,28677153,2015-03-28,29546829,Regina,"This is a very cute little room/apartment! I love the furniture in the house, especially the table and the hooks along the wall! I totally need that for all the coats and backpacks and jeans...etc. It was cozy and perfect. Great shower!!! (especially after a long cold day in Boston)"
2776143,28784408,2015-03-30,21635649,Jessica,"This place will do, but it's not amazing. Beacon Hill is, the neighborhood, so that's a plus. It's dark and wasn't the cleanest, but it certainly was do-able. I'd say it's average."
2776143,29141036,2015-04-04,10166735,Amy,My husband and I stayed in the Beacon Hill apartment for two nights.
PROS:,,,,,
- All you can possibly need within the studio,kitchen with hardware,microwave,fridge. Bathroom is fine,shower has pretty great water pressure (we enjoyed it,our water pressure home is not great).
- Whole Foods is down the street,you can buy whatever your heart desires and cook/reheat it at the apartment to save money.,,,,
- It's in a great neighborhood and location in general to get around.,,,,,
- Getting in touch with Sean was super easy,just follow his directions for communication. He was really great about meeting up with us as late arrivals around 1am.,,,,
CONS:,,,,,
-Not a con of the apartment itself,but if you are driving in to Boston be warned- PARKING is a pain,and very expensive if you leave it for extended times... Try parking on the commuter line and taking the train to cut costs and add convenience.,,,
- If you have any mobility issues/disabilities this may not be the place for you. We have neither but just wanted to mention it,the area is in Beacon Hill and you will have to walk uphill/downhill to get anywhere (not a big hill,"but a hill) and the apartment can't accommodate a wheelchair. \"",,,
2776143,29382690,2015-04-07,19471376,Brian,"Sean was a a most excellent host. We locked ourselves out the 1st morning and he was there within ten minutes to let us in (note to guests, both outside doors are security doors, always bring your key!)."
The place is tiny but when you have a room on Beacon Hill for right around 100$,you should know it will be a closet. Super convenient space,close to everything. And to all the whiners out there,if the dishes haven't been done,or the bed needs changing; make dinner plans or go have a drink at the Beacon Hill Pub and let the man know rather than bitching on Yelp. The guy's got 3 kids give him a break rather than a bad revue. Adapt and move on,it's how we survive as a species.
"Thanks Sean! It was great.\"",,,,,
2776143,29550811,2015-04-09,27477729,Dan,"Sean was very friendly and welcoming! The room as just as described, clean and the location was absolutely perfect. Within easy walking distance the centre of Boston and Irving Street itself was delightful."
"Would definitely stay again if traveling back to Boston. \"",,,,,
2776143,29810040,2015-04-13,1728277,Jay,We had a wonderful time staying at Sean's place in the Beacon Hill area of Boston. It's a great neighborhood with lots nice places to eat & shop. It's also very convenient to move around the city from this location both with the Metro & buses but more importantly you can walk all around downtown from here which we did!  The apartment is as described and was very comfortable for us during our stay. Sean was a great host staying in touch with us. We would definitely stay with him again.
2776143,30134847,2015-04-18,10871966,Ryan,Place was perfect. Sean was very accommodating as my arrival and departure times were uncertain. Thanks.
2776143,30437183,2015-04-22,2113039,Heather,"The apartment was lovely. The location is right in the center of Beacon Hill, such a gorgeous neighborhood. Sean was a great host, so helpful and always available to answer any questions. I would recommend this apartment to anyone that is planning on visiting Boston."
2776143,30759176,2015-04-27,9074236,Jim,"\"The pros... The are is superb. Right on the edge of Boston Common and the start of the Freedom Trail. the room is okay... \"\"Average\"\" - as one reviewer put it - sums it up. Water hot and comfortable bed although mattress protector (which we happened to see) was horribly stained.  BUT"
2776143,30880076,2015-04-28,29917874,青蔚,great location.. host is fine!
2776143,31027137,2015-05-01,822521,Vanessa,"Fantastic neighbourhood;  Sean is an attentive host;  Close to subway and only a short walk into Boston.  There is a Wholefoods, pharmacy and restaurants just around the corner.  As other reviews have mentioned, the space is small and I would not recommend for more than 2-3 days.  As others have also mentioned we felt it could be a little cleaner - dust layers on fan and on top of microwave especially.  I would recommend for anyone looking for a short term stay at a great price."
2776143,31422161,2015-05-05,18011981,Gerald,"The location was excellent. Several blocks from Boston Common Park. Also closed to Whole Foods grocery store. Self contained suite with access to pay laundry facilities was very convenient especially we were on a long vacation. Sean gave us some valuable information about the location of markets and transit. Room was not ready upon arrival at 11:00 am but was quickly prepped by 12:30 pm. Microwave and stove could do with a good wipe down. The home is very old and has a very rustic charm so some parts are quite worn, e.g. bathtub."
2776143,31625126,2015-05-08,18033738,Danielle,Sean was a fantastic host during our 3 days stay in Beacon Hill. Very accommodation despite our very late arrival.
The apartment is exactly what is needed for a short stay in Boston. It has a kitchenette and is a 2 minute walk from CVS/Whole foods which we found very helpful. We had no troubles getting around town- either walked or jumped on the bikes through the bikeshare system.,,,,,
Overall a wonderful time,"only problem is that we couldn't stay longer! Would definitely go with Sean again.\"",,,,
2776143,32125006,2015-05-14,30430956,Helen,Sean was awesome!! He was super flexible with when we could receive the key! He helped us save a ton of money by guiding us how to get to his place from the airport. He made us feel welcomed and comfortable. We left super early the next day and he even let our stuff be at his place while doing some last minute travels. I would def recommend him to anyone who's traveling to Boston. Love his street and it's an easy walk to the station!! Thank you Sean!
2776143,32307783,2015-05-17,23042681,Susan,"The location of this apartment couldn't be better - you'll be staying in a beautiful, historic area really close to lots of sights  and the subway is a short walk, too."
Sean is a very attentive host and was really flexible regarding things like bag drop-off.,,,,,
The apartment itself is pretty much as described in the listing.  It is a bit dated with some dust in the corners etc but the floors,sheets,"towels etc were all very clean.  The handmade furniture was also impressive! \"",,,
2776143,32454732,2015-05-18,3947887,Scott,Wonderful location.  Privacy was nice.
2776143,32958328,2015-05-24,25519070,Elaine,This unit is as described and Sean was very responsive whenever I contacted him.  You can't beat this excellent Beacon Hill location.  Most of the sites we wanted to see were within walking distance.
2776143,33348404,2015-05-27,19751365,Abel Horacio,"Cómodo, era lo que esperábamos. El lugar muy bien ubicado y tranquilo"
2776143,33499241,2015-05-29,7555316,Antoine,"The location is great, at the heart of Beacon Hill. We didn't see our host but he gave good indications to get the keys and was helpful on the phone when we wanted extra information. We had a bad surprise upon arrival of being given the wrong room, but this was quickly fixed before the first night. That said, the place is really shabby. The shower works properly but the bathtub has a really dreadful appearance and the fridge makes a terrible noise during the night. More generally, staying in the apartment was unpleasant. I would only recommend it if you're looking for a bed with a roof and four walls in Boston - which is a shame given that it's in Beacon Hill. But for travelling as a couple in a leisure trip, this was definitely not what we had hoped for."
2776143,34067570,2015-06-04,5990753,Davide,Buona soluzione economica per visitare Boston
2776143,34268949,2015-06-07,12517504,Carrie,This is my fifth time using Airbnb. I've had three winners and two losers. This on falls in the latter category. First I'll list the good things. The location was great. Close to the T & just a few blocks from the Commons & anything else you'd want to see in Boston. The price was good & the water was hot.
Now the bad. The place is filthy. There is so much dirt on the blades of the ceiling fan you could plant a garden. The lone chair is grotesquely stained. We refused to shower because of the deplorable condition of the tub. The place is small,so a minimal amount of effort to actually dust & mop would go a long way. But as it is,"I would not recommend anyone stay here. \"",,,
2776143,34848135,2015-06-13,1574600,Barbara,Our host was very gracious and welcoming.  Very helpful.
"The living/bedroom area was accurately depicted. Small and neat.\"",,,,,
2776143,35064565,2015-06-15,309162,Shawn,Sean was easy to communicate and readily available when we arrived. He escorted us to the location and made sure that everything was set up for us.
The apartment was comfortable and met our needs.,,,,,
"I would recommend this listing to a budget minded traveler who wants a great location.\"",,,,,
2776143,35447316,2015-06-19,2396477,Laurie,"Sean explained how things worked and explained the licks etc. the location is excellent.the apartment did not look like the pictures. Appearances left a little to be desired, especially the bath but all proved functional"
2776143,35769510,2015-06-22,11765435,Sophie,"Boston was an amazing city. I had a wonderful time. Sean was very easy to get in touch with and it was very nice of him to store my luggage after checkout. The apartment itself is spacious enough for 1-2 people. There was a hairdryer and iron if needed. There were a couple of things that bothered me, first of all it needs a goooood cleaning. There was dust everywhere..and some things need to be replaced. The shower was not very inviting to take a long shower but it did the job. Secondly it is very dark in the apartment! And thirdly the noise. You could hear people everywhere-outside, in the hallway and above you! And the fridge is super loud and because it is right next to the bed it bothered me at night. Nevertheless the stay overall was good. Sean seems like a nice guy and the location can't be beaten- you can walk to most places!!"
2776143,35918766,2015-06-23,8604802,Ryan,"Sean was a great host who was super responsive and communicative via text and phone leading up to our reservation. The apartment is located in the heart of Beacon Hill, convenient to many of Boston's key attractions, as well as the MGH T station and Logan Airport. The unit is dated and is small, but at this price, it is a substantial value over other options in the neighborhood."
2776143,36166516,2015-06-26,27189650,Jenny,Simple but a great location and quiet.Excellent communication beforehand. Sean explained how we could get to accommodation by train. Great feel for Boston in the area and could walk to most places. Good wifi  and maps left to get us started. I would stay there again .
2776143,36849771,2015-07-02,22058346,Luke,"Sean was helpful, and communication was good. The apartment was small, but all we needed for a couple of days, with all facilities working fine."
The area was great,lots of nice bars and restaurants,and close to the subway,so easy access anywhere in the city.,,
A couple of small downsides are that you can hear every time someone leaves or enters the building,and some of the decoration isn't quite up to hotel standard (we didn't mind,but some people are more picky),"but as we were out all day it didn't bother us. Overall a great place to stay.\"",,
2776143,36972127,2015-07-03,3195835,Daniel,"Sean was accommodating about our arrival time (our bus was late--he handled it gracefully), responsive, and all that good stuff. The place is small and not a luxury hotel, but that was what we were expecting and we had a fine time staying there. The neighborhood is wonderful."
2776143,37446311,2015-07-07,8264976,Jennifer,"A no frills, very affordable place to stay in a great neighborhood. Very walkable to North End. About a 45 min walk to Fenway. It's small, but fits 2 people comfortably."
2776143,37727377,2015-07-10,24927199,Aida,"La ubicación es muy buena ya que puedes ir caminando al centro en 15-20 minutos tranquilamente. La zona es muy tranquila y se puede descansar. El apartamento está recién pintado de blanco,  está un poco sucio pero nosotros lo queríamos para dormir exclusivamente así que no hubo problema. La bañera está un poco oxidada en algunas zonas."
2776143,38577956,2015-07-17,10241326,Michelle,"This apartment is in an excellent location. Although it is small and located in an older building, you are in the old Boston area of Beacon Hill, so you can't beat that. The walls are now painted white so it's much brighter. The bathtub looks a little scary, but it's just worn - not dirty. Sean's communication was great. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, especially for this location at this price."
2776143,39367891,2015-07-23,10930935,Ryan,"The description is very accurate and Sean was easy to get a hold of. It is not fancy, but a great location. Has a small AC unit and ceiling fan that cooled the room off perfectly in the evening, when we went it was around low 90s the week we went and very humid. I thought the bed was not the most comfortable thing, but my fiancé had no issues with it. I would recommend this place to a low budget traveler who plans on spending little time at the apartment."
2776143,39602725,2015-07-25,29953574,Julia,Sean met us shortly after our arrival and escorted us to the apartment.  The location in Beacon Hill was exceptional and that is the reason we choose this place but the condition of the listing was poor.  The bathtub needs a good cleaning and some anti-slip stickers.  My young son slipped and luckily I was able to grab his arm.  The place also needs a good cleaning especially the fan.
2776143,40070783,2015-07-28,17374315,Heinz,We underestimated the traffic on the last miles before Boston and arrived more than one hour late. This was not a problem to Sean.
The neighbourhood is quiet full of interesting buildings and we felt good.,,,,,
"The room is rather dark. We found the bed very comfortable. The degree of cleanliness in the bathroom did not meet our expectations.\"",,,,,
2776143,40424938,2015-07-31,11439113,Jennifer,"Sean ci ha accolti nel bellissimo quartiere di Beacon Hill direttamente davanti a casa sua. Ci ha accompagnati dietro l'angolo e mostrato l'appartamento. Piccolo, ma funzionale, è dotato di tutto ciò che può servire ad una coppia per trascorrere dei giorni in città! La posizione è ottima per raggiungere il centro e visitare Boston!"
2776143,41341642,2015-08-07,11939849,Jan & Liesbeth,"We had a good stay at Sean's place.  It is in a good location to walk around the city.  Only expensive for parking the car (ours was 48 dollars for 34 hours, in an open space parking place at about 20 minutes by foot)  Sean was very correct about arrival time and the keys.  The entrance of the  building was poor and not clean but the room was ok.  There is a bathroom and in the room itself is a sink, a fire which we didn't use, and a fridge.  Also an electric kettle to make some coffee.  There is an old window airco that helps a lot if you can turn it on some time before you go to sleep but makes a lot of noice.  But there is also a fan on the ceiling which we let on at night and was ok.  The furniture is indeed quiet special.  The studio is not shared so you have it for yourself.  So overall we are happy about our stay."
2776143,41598342,2015-08-08,23265645,Maeva,Sean is really nice. He was flexible with the check-in/out hours.
"The apartment is nice but not clean enough. \"",,,,,
2776143,41762206,2015-08-09,27115725,Nilla,Sean was a nice person. The place is very close to the red line and well located with all restaurants nearby and it was easy and secure to join the center by food.
2776143,42387475,2015-08-13,25604260,Dennis,"The location of this Appartment is great we were able to walk & use the subway system to visit historic sites, the Boston Opera House for Kinky Boots, etc. the apartment is minimal, but Sean was very helpful."
2776143,42821022,2015-08-16,29126380,David,"Great neighbourhood, convenient location. Sean was accommodating re: check-in and luggage drop. The studio is small but met our basic needs for a one-night stay in Boston."
2776143,44078950,2015-08-23,11250090,Melvin,Sean was a wonderful host he showed us and told us Boston was a great city with lots to offer. I would definitely recommend Sean as a place to stay thank Sean

2776143,45675563,2015-09-05,2773153,Sarah,This is a great location in Beacon Hill for the price. Easy walk to everything. Stay here because you want the location not for the accommodations. The room is stuffy and well worn. Host was easy to reach and check in was smooth.
2776143,45920398,2015-09-07,25923030,Isabel,"Our bus was delayed coming in but Sean was just round the corner for us. The apartment is tiny, a studio with the kitchen in the one room but it has everything we needed and it's perfectly located."
2776143,46364411,2015-09-10,28019033,Lyndsay & Neal,If it wasn't for Sean's apartment I know we could not have afforded to come to Boston. For that we are greatful.
The location is excellent -  few minutes walk to the red line and blue line and a short walk (albeit up a hill) to Boston Common to start on the freedom trail.,,,,,
Sean is really friendly and helpful. The great things about the apartment are definitely the location,the price,the shower had great pressure,and the air conditioning (it was 33oC plus every day during our visit). The bed was comfy too.,,
The apartment (and building in general) could definitely benefit from a revamp - however if an investment was made to decorate,repair,generally improve etc,Sean could quadruple the rent and we couldn't have afforded it! Bit of a catch 22.,,
We were prepared from other guests' comments as to what to expect and we knew it would be basic / unkempt. Still,seeing wildlife skitter across the bathroom floor is not something you will ever get used to,but we understand Sean is sorting this out with the building management.,,,
Boston is such a great city,"we loved it so much and would like to come back (maybe we'll save for a little longer and book a hotel though).\"",,,,
2776143,46691227,2015-09-13,28407680,David,"Our experience overall was nice, the apartment was everything we needed for two guys travelling and visiting Boston for a few days."
2776143,47030878,2015-09-15,2660814,Guénaëlle,"My boyfriend and I spent 2 nights at Sean's place. The studio is quiet and comfortable with everything we would need and enough space for 2. The neighborhood is very nice, close to everything for do sightseeing. But, few details explain the 3 stars instead of 5: the studio wasn't as clean as we would expect, the bed linen smelt bad (even if I trust Sean when he said that he cleaned them. Maybe the odors come from the bed and the pillows...) and the wifi didn't work after one night."
2776143,47248882,2015-09-17,36150708,Maeve,"Great location, easy to find. Bedroom is very comfortable and and bathroom is spacious and clean."

2776143,48671074,2015-09-28,1547179,Chuck,We were able to access the place soon after getting off our ship. Sean was helpful. We were in contact through Airbnb messaging all the time. He responded rapidly and met all of our needs. No problems and a very nice stay in Boston.
2776143,49091861,2015-10-01,447772,Lindsay,"For the price, this was a good value. Perfect location. It was small, but that didn't matter as we were rarely in the spot. It was not super clean, however. It was easy to find and Sean was very responsive to emails and such."
2776143,49204294,2015-10-02,11249766,Ailsa,"Sean's place was just perfect for what we needed- a place to crash after a long flight in the centre of Boston. It was a little bigger than we expected from the photos - which was a nice surprise. It's a bit basic as you'd expect...... but everything you'd need was there. Sean responded with good instructions about how to get in when our flight was delayed. Thanks, Sean."

"Room was definitely in the \"\"Cozy\"\" category",which I suppose was to be expected given the neighborhood and the price of the room.   However,other airbnb'ers should be aware of this.  The location is hard to beat.,,,
"\"",,,,,
2776143,50218189,2015-10-10,45069359,Matthew,Honestly this wasn't a good experience. When we arrived Sean had forgotten we were here and we had to spend a fortune making a phone call to him so we could get directions on where to get the key. And to be honest his attitude was slightly rude and impatient with us. Once we had arrived we wanted to rest for an hour before going out only to be informed the bed sheets haven't been changed. The place is quite dirty and needs a good clean top to bottom. The next morning my wife woke up to find a cockroach walking across the floor. There were spiders in the bath tub which made us not want to shower there. The final straw was stepping out the apartment to find dog mess nearly everywhere. It might be a good location but the neighbourhood is dirty and unkept. I wouldn't stay here again and would spend the extra money and get a hotel next time
2776143,50263944,2015-10-11,17170687,Yolanda,"Sean, was a good host. He gave us great step by step directions on how to get to his place and the keys. He came after to clean and give us clean towel. Hey was very busy but was attentive."
2776143,50742457,2015-10-14,372999,Brady And Angie,Was perfect for our stay. Very simple inside the room but had all the basics. We would stay here again
"\"",,,,,
2776143,50968485,2015-10-16,8725607,Leslie,"Sean was very helpful and responsive throughout my stay.  I got to Boston quite late so was navigating the lock system in the dark.  I couldn't get it to open (turned out I made a mistake) and Sean helped me over the phone at about 11PM.  I really appreciated it!  I was once mugged at gunpoint in Boston, and the street his apartment is on felt a little questionable at that time of night, so I was quite relieved when he answered the phone immediately.  No problems after that!"
The small,"studio apartment was clean and the bed was quite comfortable.  It was quite run down though -- an old Boston rowhouse in need of renovation -- and definitely could use some TLC.  \"",,,,
2776143,51021851,2015-10-17,14315471,Eric And Dawn,"We really enjoyed this last night of our trip in this studio in the heart of a happening neighborhood of Boston. Sean communicated well and left good instructions for us to find and to get in his place, and he worked with us to allow us to drop off our luggage early so that we could spend the day looking around the city."
2776143,51546363,2015-10-21,4375731,Linda,Great location and easy to find with the welcome email. Sean arranged a place where I could store my luggage until my flight in the evening after I'd checked out.
2776143,51695559,2015-10-24,2048442,Roberto,"Sean was very helpful. The apartment is very well located and exceeded our expectations. The next time, we will certainly staying with Sean."
2776143,52038932,2015-10-26,32429453,Lucy,"So, here's the good stuff: the location of this apartment is perfect. It's close to everything, easy to access and definitely cheap."
But... like other reviewers have noted,it is like a student studio. It's small and a bit cramped for two. There are no homely touches - it's purely functional - and doesn't quite feel comfortable. We stayed for two nights,which was plenty. It wouldn't take much to make it feel lovely... although it would probably then cost more.,,,
There was previous occupants' food left in the cupboard,which was off-putting. I wouldn't have wanted to cook in the apartment without first washing everything thoroughly. It felt like the place needed a deep-clean.,,,,
We were there on a Friday and Saturday night and it was quite noisy. People seemed to congregate outside and the chatting sounded like they were in the room.,,,,,
We met Sean on arrival and he was chatty and friendly. What was strange was that the apartment was not actually on the street as billed - Irving Street - but round the corner.,,,,,
All in all,"I guess you get what you pay for. I'm just glad we didn't stay for more than two nights.\"",,,,
2776143,52568881,2015-10-31,34326500,Jean Philippe,"Le logement occupé (qui ne correspndait pas à celui annoncé mais à proximité immédiate) est très bien situé (cœur de ville, proche de tout les essentiels, y compris transports en commun) et parfaitement bien équipé. Il s'agit d'un studio avec trois vrais couchage (pas de matelas pneumatique pour faire le 3ème). Le tout est ancien, mériterait sans aucun doute un bon rafraichissement, particulièrement la salle de bain (les photos sont trompeuses) et la propreté laisse un peu à désirer (il suffit de se pencher sous le lit pour s'en apercevoir). Sean, que nous n'avons pas vu durant notre séjour, est un hôte arrangeant (check out à 3PM). Les clefs sont récupérés et déposées dans une boite à combinaison dans la rue). Aucun problème majeur ou insurmontable, nous y reviendrions sans aucune retenue."
2776143,52820948,2015-11-02,39384081,Kayla,Sean was an excellent communicator. I felt like everything was clear on how to get there and where to stay. The place is very close to everything in Boston and it had a small kitchen (we didn't end up using it). The bed was comfortable and the towels provided were nice and clean. I would totally stay here again!

2776143,55646042,2015-12-03,50171536,Marcos,"The host was very clear and concise on how to get to the apartment from the airport. It was very helpful, considering Boston doesn't have a grid system. The host was also very flexible with my check-out, it was helpful, because I didn't have to rush. The description was accurate, very homely and accommodating."
2776143,56142754,2015-12-09,49352270,Chenyang,Nice clean and quiet room in great location. Would recommend it.
2776143,56713707,2015-12-17,27345842,Daria,"La casa è un po' meno carina di come sembrava in foto. È comunque pulita, con tutto quello che serve per cucinare e stare qualche giorno a boston senza spendere troppo. Sicuramente ci sarebbe qualche piccola miglioria da fare ma nel complesso va bene. Quando dovete prendere la chiave dell'appartamento leggete bene le istruzioni, noi abbiamo fatto casino e ne abbiamo prese due pensando che ci fossero solo le nostre. La casa in realtà è in Philip street che è dietro l'angolo."
"The house is a little bit less nice that looks like in the picture. Is clean and comfy and near to all in boston. It needs some fixing up but it's ok. Read well the instruction for the keys because we made a mess taking one pair not ours. The house is in Philip street around the corner\"",,,,,
2776143,57004401,2015-12-21,34722864,Tamara,"I didn't have any contact with Sean but he provided a clean description of how to check in and out. Keys were easy to access. Room was comfortable and clean but right next to the street making it noisy at night. Close to restaurants, shops and a very festive Christmas area."
2776143,57203237,2015-12-23,37429147,Yasmine,"Beacon Hill is a nice place to stay, Boston Common Park is not far, shops and restaurants are in walking distance. Unfortunately the room didn't match our expectations. The bed was ok, quite comfortable, the sheets clean and towels too, even if it was really too small for four adults. But there were no dishtowels to dry the dishes and no breakfast at all, except of some eggs. All in all the room had a shabby appearance; you could do much more out of it!"
2776143,57516063,2015-12-27,30390718,Brock,"Although we never met Sean during check in or check out, he was a very responsive host who catered to our needs. The space itself was in a great location, a maximum ten minute walk to major train stations. There were also plenty of choices for food nearby. Plenty of amenities were provided by Sean, which came in handy as we stayed over Christmas Day! I would most certainly stay here again if travelling to Boston."
2776143,57866954,2015-12-30,26697045,Alyana & Ryan,"Sean was a very responsive host. He answered our questions and gave very straightforward directions to getting the key, finding the apartment, and getting around the city via public transportation. We arrived earlier than the check in time and Sean cleaned the previous guest's mess when we headed out to explore the city."
However,we were disappointed with our experience in this apartment. Our other reason for booking with this place was to see the unique interior advertised in the listing,but once we arrived,it looked like the apartment was in the process of repainting. Since it the place seemed incomplete,the apartment looked like it was in a poor state of disrepair. The windows in the bathroom had a quarter inch gap that made the bathroom very cold. The toilet needs to be bolted down and the shower curtains were held by a piece of string. At one point during our stay we had to scrub the bathtub because we thought it was still dirty.,
The price was great,"but there are more comfortable places in the area.\"",,,,
2776143,58102641,2015-12-31,13636912,Stacey,The place was as described in a good location. I only spent a few hours there since I had a flight to catch late at night. No complaints. All was good.

Todas las facilidades, elementos de cocina, secador de pelo y mantas extras. Muy contentos con el departamento en su relación precio/calidad"
2776143,59360707,2016-01-10,43815103,Deborah,"The listing was just as described, especially the convenient locations. After getting oriented, I was able to walk to more of my conference destinations, even at night given the host's helpful recommendations about safety. The details provided were a lot, but all helpful throughout my stay. I'd stay again for a conference in Boston."
2776143,59748207,2016-01-15,30254939,Troy,"The location was great, and it was very easy to access the apartment. We had everything we needed, though the place is old and a bit grimy."
2776143,59940335,2016-01-17,6560612,Chris,Great apartment right in the heart of the city.  The furniture was all really well made and it was a pleasure staying here!
2776143,60235870,2016-01-20,50367029,Anh,"It was close to where we wanted to be: near the beginning of the freedom trail and cute shops/restaurants. It was also close to the public transit in case we needed it, but we mostly walked around and ubered. The key was easy to access and we didn't have trouble, but the way it was described made me skeptical. The biggest thing that bothered me, throughout the two nights I stayed there, was the faucet kept leaking and it was the most annoying thing in the world. I tried to get it to stop by softening the fall with a sponge, but it could not be avoided. It's an easy fix though and I hope it's done next time I go there, because I would love to stay again."

2776143,61482579,2016-02-05,49750994,Adam,"It was just what I was looking for--a private studio in a good location. In addition to being very close to the T, there's a Starbucks, an Au Bon Pain and lots of restaurants and stores within a short walk. Pretty much ideal place to stay when visiting Boston. Sean was very responsive and helped me with checking in, then left me alone for the rest of my stay. No complaints. Good experience."
2776143,61767022,2016-02-08,40606589,Isabella,The apartment is super close to everything. We had an awesome time in Boston and Sean was a great host too. Our flight was delayed and we arrived at 11:30pm and she stayed awake in case we need anything. Thanks for letting us stay at your apartment and made our trip perfect :)
2776143,62037450,2016-02-10,11005287,Lucas,"Overall our experience was decent. The location of the apartment and proximity to transit is great. However, the faucet leaked through the entire trip which was a bit annoying (especially trying to sleep at night). Also there was some trash under the bed, and the medicine cabinet in the bathroom was filthy. On the second day of our trip, we had to get some work done during the day before our plans that evening, however the wifi went out, and was out for the whole afternoon. We didn't get a response from Sean until that evening, and apparently the modem and router are in a different room in the building because we couldn't find them to try reset the connection."

2776143,62492452,2016-02-15,24739336,Griffin,"This was our second stay with Sean at this location, and we hope to be back again someday. Unbeatable value for the prime Beacon Hill location. It's the perfect spot to rest and recharge during a busy weekend. To top it off, Sean was responsive and helpful with complications that arose due to the record-setting cold temps during our stay."
2776143,62802460,2016-02-17,3496269,Carrie,"Sean was very accommodating allowing us to drop off luggage early. The apt is as pictured--pretty basic but met our needs. It's in a great location; close to Whole Foods, the train and Boston Common! Due to no fault of Sean's, water in the bldg  had to be shut off our last night there yet he gave us a partial refund."

"The door on your apt didn't have a \"\"2\"\" on it so there was an initial hesitancy to try to unlock an unknown door! There weren't top sheets on either bed","and only 3 towels when there was 4 of us. It was a nice place for the one night. :)\"",,,,

The space itself is as described - perhaps on the small side if you were hoping to cook in,but it was adequate for the two of us as we ate out and only needed it for sleeping.,,,,
Sean's communication was timely and comprehensive and we felt we had answers to anything we may have needed to ask.,,,,,

2776143,71378577,2016-04-25,43973582,Amy,"We had a great time during our stay at this location! The apartment is very close to Cambridge street, but far enough away to not hear the constant car noises. There are a lot of nearby restaurants and shopping. Their are two T stops, each about 6 blocks away on two different lines, which was very convenient! Our flight was in the morning, before check in, but Sean was gracious enough to let us in early. It's a good place to stay for 2, maybe 3 people. And its certainly one of the cheapest places to stay in Beacon Hill! The wood working in the apartment is gorgeous! The bed is a little hard for my tastes, but miles may vary. If we ever travel to Boston again, we will absolutely stay here."

Freedom Trail, Boston Common, Old State House, Cheers, etc. Sean's communication was heat from start to finish. The place could stand to use a good deep cleaning. Areas in the  bathroom, window seals, blinds, etc all had a good thick layer of dust built up and the two towels available had not been washed prior to our arrival. Which wasn't a huge deal as we purchases our own towels at target for our stay. But certainly some things to keep in mind. Overall for the cost and location a very good deal."

The first day I just wanted to ask him if we could check in a little earlier, he didn't answered any of my calls or texts. And in the first night, we found the wifi has problem and I  texted him and he said he would check it next morning, however it was still no wifi next day and he didn't reply me any more!

2776143,83675089,2016-07-03,8120681,Laurie,Thank you for hosting us Sean! I appreciate your patience with my foggy travel brain when we arrived. The location was amazing and exactly what we needed for our short stay in Boston. We had a great time in your fine city.
2776143,84464314,2016-07-07,18017058,Breanna,"A great, quiet spot for some R&R. A good central location for checking out the many attractions of Boston. I barely interacted with Sean, but he keeps a tidy room and the spec was nice and private."
2776143,84647378,2016-07-08,81453813,Claire,Nice one room apartment for cheap. The bathroom was a little dirty but that's what you get for the price. Nice neighborhood and Sean was helpful.
2776143,84933901,2016-07-09,80955008,Forrest,Sean was a very kind and responsive host. The sheets and towels were clean and the place on beacon hill is in a perfect location to explore center city Boston. Just a few minutes away from Boston Commons. The quaint one room space with an extended bathroom was perfect for two people.
2776143,87086037,2016-07-18,1511903,Janice,"Sean is quick with any questions you may have, and he has a good honor system going with all his guests. We were able to drop our luggage off early. Sean's place is right at the heart of Beacon Hill. You are able to live like a local in a beautiful and unique neighborhood, and it is not too far of a walk from Boston Commons/ MA State house. not ideal if you plan to cook, but everything else was great. If you are looking for a convenient place to stay in for a short stay in Boston, this is the place!"

The apartment itself is basic and modest however it was super clean and that's what matters to us. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Boston, especially it it your first time to the city!"
2776143,89083508,2016-07-26,551288,Malcolm,"If you are looking a small, excellently located place to use as a base to explore Boston you cannot go far wrong with booking this Studio. It is located in Beacon Hill and is an easy walk to shops, restaurants and sights of Boston."
The studio is just one flight of steps up and the neighbours are quiet.,,,,,
Sean keeps you informed throughout the booking process and was at hand when I had a question during my stay ..... even early on a Sunday.,,,,,
"I highly recommend the Studio as somewhere rest at the end of the day. \"",,,,,
2776143,91064522,2016-08-03,24878441,Nick,Great little apartment in a great location. Communication was easy and apartment was very comfortable
2776143,92094847,2016-08-07,18201358,Vicki,"Unfortunately we didn't have a great start to our stay as when we arrived to pick up the keys they were not there! We managed to get hold of Sean but had to wait an hour on the street with our suitcases for him to arrive with another set despite being told half an hour. However, the apartment was as described and in an excellent location, easy walking distance for everything we did and felt like a safe area. I would have liked the bathroom a little cleaner but apart from that it was all good and we managed to cook in the kitchen on one of the nights that we stayed which was really useful for us."
2776143,92498030,2016-08-08,1023730,Kathi,"We loved the neighborhood and picked Sean's place because it was steps away from my old apartment I lived in during my 20s- a nostalgia trip. We did meet Sean who seemed very nice. We gave a low rating because this is a marginally maintained building and studio. We were disappointed in the shabby condition of the interior building entry, filthy carpets- rundown feel. It happens I know on Beacon Hill with old places. The studio one room is the size it appears in the photo but is not accurate to the photo. The bathroom has a terrible looking tub and the sink is very old pedestal and pink and not the one shown on the site photo. There is no longer natural pine panelling, but is painted orange flat paint. Floors are wood but badly scratched. Roller shades are tenement style ugly and taped with duct tape. Windows are so, so needing to be cleaned and could easily be windexed from the street since the apt is street level. Very skimpy dishes/glasses. Couldn't find one drinking glass but maybe we missed that."
Pros are that it is quiet,it was relatively clean on surfaces,hot shower,very comfy bed- wonderful mattress. And of course loved the location.,,
"There is no TV but they never said there was so that's ok. We didn't think about that and missed the Olympics at night but went to a bar to watch. \"",,,,,
2776143,92683912,2016-08-09,60358812,Iris,"Sean's place is in an ideal location! The place is on the hill with a short walking distance to the subway and the Charles River. Checking into the place was easy and his directions were great! It is good for short term stays. The place is sufficient, like a studio with the kitchen area next to the bed. It worked well for our travels!"

2776143,95954634,2016-08-21,68417017,Kimberly,"My coworker and I stayed at Sean’s place this last weekend, staying from Friday to Saturday. We had confirmation from him before the week of that check in was at 12 pm but cleaning might take until 3 pm. On Friday morning, Sean informed us that he would be by in the afternoon to clean, and we said that was fine and that we wouldn’t be back before 5 pm. We waited until 6 pm to come back to the place, and nothing was cleaned still. Trash in trashcans. Dirty sheets on the bed. Dirty towel on the floor. We texted, emailed and called Sean to ask him if he was planning on cleaning and when we should expect to have the place ready. It took him forty minutes to finally text us back and said he was coming to do it now. Then a few minutes later he texted back saying he was going to clean ANOTHER one of his Air BNBs before ours. We technically should have had this Air BNB cleaned and ready at our check in at 12 pm, and ended up not having it cleaned and ready until 7 pm. After our stay, the only communication we had with Sean was having him say we didn’t return the keys that he quickly found. Disappointment would not even begin to describe how we felt. We were understanding of cleaning and schedules, but do not have check in after 12 pm or say cleaning will be done sometimes until 3 pm if you are going to keep us out of your apartment and waiting for 4 hours later. We are thankful we still got to stay there a night and that was the only reason we did not ask for a partial refund."
2776143,96193174,2016-08-22,41883833,Dennis,"The photo isnt accurate - it gives the impression of a high gloss, wooden interior - well, that wall has been painted a dull reddish color, the next wall a dull sand color.  The bathroom tub has a ding in it that we thought was a giant, dead bug at first.  The shower curtain is held up by a string in one spot.  The sheets werent changed since we viewed the unit early, and saw the bed unmade, then made later, with the same bedding.  The towel hanging in the bathroom was re-folded. This is really not worthy of paying any money for it, and it shouldnt be on Air BNB if they had actual standards of enforcement.  We would gladly accept a refund.  This and the previous Air BNB experience have discouraged us from using AirBNB in the future."
369880,19454962,2014-09-13,7119417,Jorji,"What a fantastic place to stay during our week  in Boston. Great location, Murphy bed was very comfortable. Lived the neighborhood/ North End... We felt like we lived there, chatted with older neighbors several times. It was nice to have the kitchen if we needed it, we pretty much just did coffee, yogurt & fruit for breakfasts. Would highly recommend ... There are 45 steps up, pretty narrow, not a problem for us but could be for some. We climbed the 294 steps at the Bunker Hill monument, so getting to our place was a piece  of pastry!!! ( from Modern Bakery, our preferred pastry shop!!!) thanks Carlos & Cheryl for sharing your place with us..."

Carlos and Cheryl were very easy to work with and gave us great information about the apartment and the neighborhood. The North End area of Boston is very safe and clean. It also has delicious Italian restaurants :). The only drawback to the apartment (and we were aware of this upfront) is the narrow staircase and the climb to the 4th floor. However, I would definitely recommend this apartment to my friends and family."
369880,31933451,2015-05-12,26705923,Neema,"I absolutely loved the location of the (URL HIDDEN) central and convenient! Since the apartment is in North End they are plenty of restaurants to choose from I went running by the Charles River which was great. Again, within minutes from the apartment."
The apartment itself was furnished with everything one would need. Very comfortable and cosy. And the hosts Cheryl and Carlos were very accommodating!! When I travel to Boston,I will first check and see if this apartment is available before I make any other plans!!,,,,
"Thank you!!!\"",,,,,
369880,34269995,2015-06-07,25601068,Aine,My family and I stayed in Boston in June 2015. We had a wonderful stay for all of our 8 nights . The apartment is in a brilliant  location in the north end so we were able to walk everywhere. The apartment is well equipped and was perfect for our family of 4. It was also very quiet which we were very pleased about. Carlos and Cheryl gave us lots of information prior to staying and all instructions were very clear. We would not hesitate to stay again if we are lucky enough to be in the beautiful Boston. Thanks so much Carlos and Cheryl for letting us stay in your perfect apartment!! We loved every minute.

369880,52967679,2015-11-03,13887453,Brenda,"This was a perfect Airbnb experience! Carlos and Cheryl responded quickly to all my questions. Once I had booked their lovely condo, I received an email with detailed information regarding the condo, the North End neighborhood, and much more. Upon arrival, we were delighted, as the condo was even better than we had anticipated. It was fully equipped with everything we might need. Carlos and Cheryl have anticipated their quests wants and needs perfectly. The condo was nicely decorated and very clean and comfortable. The Murphy bed was extremely comfortable! The condo's location, in the North End, was perfect! We were within walking distance to almost everything, and for the few times we needed a ride, we used Uber. We used the Park and Stay option at the nearby Government Center Garage for our car and only paid $15, instead of $45 per day. This option must be paid for ahead of arrival on the internet. We loved walking the Italian neighborhoods and talking to the people who live there. The three flights of stairs up to the condo took some getting used to, but helped us work off some of the calories we consumed at the numerous restaurants and bakeries nearby. We will definitely return to Boston and stay at Carlos and Cheryl's wonderful studio condo again, as it was perfect for us!"
369880,54314857,2015-11-18,44662686,Claire,Cheryl and Carlos were fantastic hosts. We had great information ahead of the trip and they were really happy to help with anything during the trip.

369880,58310489,2016-01-02,9992353,Krithiga,Carlos and Cheryl's North End Condo worked out great for our stay in Boston. Very conveniently located! Carlos and Cheryl are thoughtful hosts and were very easy to communicate with. They had provided us all the information well in advance and also had a nice book on walking tours of Boston that we used to explore the possibility. Will definitely stay again!
369880,59380660,2016-01-10,34555221,Meg,"This place was great when my boyfriend and I stayed. Not only was it a cheaper and overall better alternative than a hotel, it was wonderful all on its own. Kitchen has everything you need, information books/pamphlets are there for you, and the bed was very comfortable. The neighborhood was also very safe and is only a couple of minutes away from the main street in the North End. Also a quick walk to Faneuil Hall! It's on the fourth floor with a tight staircase so keep this in mind when planning which luggage to bring. Would definitely recommend."
369880,68278583,2016-04-04,29660089,Sharon,"I received my keys for this studio a couple weeks before my departure along with a self-addressed envelope for their return. It couldn't have been easier.  The studio is in the middle of a somewhat off the beaten path street but I loved the fact I recognized it immediately among the other similar entryways because it looked just like it did in the photo.  The studio was comfortable, cozy, had everything I needed and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The location was tremendous! It was a 10 minute walk at the most to any and everything and was mostly quiet-more quiet than many hotel rooms.  The hosts were not in town but there were many tour books and so on in the studio. The Internet functioned well and quickly As did the stove, oven, microwave and everything else."
369880,72045179,2016-04-30,40067290,Val,Everything was really lovely in the apartment and it was so cosy and comfortable.  We arrived very late and forgot to send the manual to our phones but Carlos was very understanding and resent it as it contained all the informaiton that is needed.  The bed was really comfy and as there were only two of us we left it down.  The apartment was well stocked and we wanted for nothing.  The location was superb for exploring Boston and we loved being in one of the the historic districts.  Everything was within walking distance.
We even got to enjoyed watching 2 Blue jays trying to make a nest on the fire escape steps of the opposite building.  Their antics were so funny.,,,,,

369880,91299155,2016-08-04,41997256,Chris,As people new to Boston we don't think we could have been in a much nicer area. Great shops and restaurants on Salem and Hanover Sts. Even a launderette close by on Salem which was helpful. Functional bar just a few yards away. Our first stay in the US and it was a great experience. The condo was compact and we had to move some furniture to accommodate our cases. We were aware of the 3 flights of stairs beforehand. Good facilities including wi-fi. Overall a great introduction to the US

4278873,30387585,2015-04-21,759970,Roni,"Cindy is a gracious and generous host.   At the end of February, I booked a room with her so that I could affordably watch my son run the Boston Marathon on April 20. At the time, my family said they would not have room for me to stay with them, and I thought it would be easy enough for me to get to the Marathon to meet them the next morning. I dropped off my bag on Sunday afternoon to go have dinner with them; the room was as posted, with a private half bath, a comfortable bed and dresser, and coffee and breakfast the next morning. Cindy also offered a cable connection in case I wanted to watch cable tv on my laptop.  As it turned out, however, my family was able to put me up, so rather than face the challenge of trying to meet them the next morning, especially with the threat of cold, rainy, and windy weather (which it was), we all felt it would be much easier for me just to stay with them. So I went back to retrieve my bag and called Cindy to let her know I would not be staying there after all. She asked if there was something wrong with the room, which I assured her there was not, but that it was the challenge of getting to the Marathon to meet my family the next morning. Her listing has a strict cancellation policy, but Cindy felt bad that I had paid for the room and would not be using it, so she immediately offered to refund my money. That was extremely generous of her as well as not necessary since the policy is clearly stated on the page, and since I had booked the room almost 2 months in advance, she certainly could have had another guest at that time. So all in all, I give Cindy high marks and would recommend anyone to stay there."
4278873,30865229,2015-04-28,28074765,Dale,My host Cindy welcomed me and make check in very easy. My room was very nice and I had use of the kitchen which allowed me to have breakfast there most of the time. I had a private half bath and the shower was just a short walk across the living room. There was a small washer/dryer combo that was very nice since I stayed for six days.
The neighborhood was very quiet and easy to walk around. I used Hubway bikes to get around Boston and there is a rack about a 10 minute walk from the house. There was a fair amount of trash on the street and sidewalk in front of the house.,,,,,

I also asked before hand if she had an iron and she left it out for me.,,
"Cindy is great at responding back in a timely manner and she was very accommodating. I would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
4278873,65535657,2016-03-15,55475104,Nok,"This is my first experience to use airbnb, but I could enjoy my travel because of Cindy. She gave me much effort to support me. The way to the room from the airport, how to use the kitchen, the clean to room, etc. I actually lived in Boston comfortably. If I have a chance to come Boston, I will also use Cindy's room."
4278873,69566910,2016-04-11,58652949,伟杰,"Cindy是个十分负责的房东,有问必答,很有耐心。她得房子也非常好,地理位置很方便,去市区很近,房子中的生活用品一应俱全,房间里很干净,每个租客走后都会有专门的人来打扫,wifi速度也不错,是个很温馨的家,推荐来玩的人可以住在这,是个不错的选择。"

Mom thoroughly enjoyed her room and the amenities such as her own private bathroom and use of a fully stocked kitchen. Kitchen has all the basic pantry items and we brought our own food to save on spending in Boston. The house is on a dead end and very quiet. Located in Allston it is so convenient. It is on a bus line that connects with the Green Line \"\"T\"\". Parked the car all weekend on Cambridge for overnight. Perfectly safe. Be mindful of alternate street parking for street cleaning; but you will see all the cars parked to one side."

4278873,83279536,2016-07-02,14734146,Ellen,Cindy was a wonderful host. The place was exactly how it was described. Enjoyed the complimentary coffee to start my days off. Cindy was even nice enough to allow me to check in earlier in the day which was nice so I didn't have to store my luggage for the day.
8420883,53710547,2015-11-11,5283648,Sarah,"Margarita was very nice. The room was fairly large and minimally furnished with a queen sized bed, a wooden chair, and a shelving unit. The bathroom was nice and modern. My only complaint is that I wasn't given a key, so I had to rely on someone being home in order to be let into the house every time I wanted to leave an return. Also, the area does not seem to be the best area of Boston, I would not walk around this area at night."
8420883,54751358,2015-11-23,42943563,Kohei,"There is no key so you could be bothered by ringing the door bell to get in the house each time. (There is always people in house who open the door for you, so don't worry) Room condition is fine. I strongly recommend to take a cab to get back at night for its location."
"Margarita is very easy to talk.\"",,,,,
8420883,64969248,2016-03-09,9047734,Stephan,We made arrangement to our clients at Margarita's place. She was really accommodating despite the late hour of flight.
8420883,68913643,2016-04-07,54880673,Sanwal,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8420883,74506489,2016-05-15,62059863,Ian,When I arrived Margarita was most welcoming and very helpful with her advice and assistance to become familiar with Boston and what it had to offer. The room and facilities were adequate for my needs and the neighborhood had great access to both bus and train transport. All in All I enjoyed the time that I spent in Boston.
8420883,81176688,2016-06-21,71656236,Bradley,I'll start with the pros:
The neighborhood is great. Most of the people on the street are nice and say hello. Also,there is an African food market right down the street that sales inexpensive fish and groceries.,,,,
The host is a nice person at heart.,,,,,
The cons:,,,,,
The room is very far away from town.,,,,,
Public transportation ranges from perfect to spotty- one time I had to get an Uber home because the buses were delayed over an hour. The residence is far enough away from the city for walking to be impractical.,,,,,
Although nice,the host does not seem to understand how to operate a business of this nature.,,,,
The host charged $40 for an extra person but did not offer an additional mattress or key until asked. This usually would not be an issue; however,the host made me and my roomate take a bed up a very narrow flight of stairs and I had to assemble the frame. This was doable for two young men,but was not easy. The key had to be made,which means that one of us went without a key for a day.,,
The host left town and expected me to leave the city to let in another guest. The host called and texted me numerous times during a professional meeting,despite me telling her that I would not be able to let the guest in. This was very distracting and disrespectful for me and the person that was waiting to get in.,,,,
The other guest waited at her doorstep for several hours and ended up sleeping at a random neighbor's house the first night- this could be you.,,,,,
In addition,the host sent me a picture of the other guest's passport for some reason- I guess so I could verify who he was. However,"this is grossly inappropriate and makes me extremely uncomfortable knowing she has a picture of my ID.\"",,,
7869497,57467429,2015-12-26,8181605,Eben,"The place you are shown to when you rent this does not match the photos in size or refinement. There were several other more issues as well. Here is a sample: a lightbulb not working, smoke detector with a low battery that beeps, toilet not clean, air filters not changed for what looks like a year+. Also loud construction going on next door ( diving piles into the ground!) which was never mentioned. But best of all... a management company representative with the cheek to say that this place was an upgrade for which I should be happy! The problems I found were not fixed in the 3 days I was there despite very kind and vigorous help from Airbnb. I cannot recommend this place and would urge Airbnb to purge placed being managed by this company from Airbnb."
7869497,60013380,2016-01-18,30801249,Meshari,"Hello,"
It was a great time I spend in your apartment,because of the amazing area,new building,clean and safe. But the thing I didn't like,that when I had an emergency case to leave Boston 10 days before the check out date. You didn't not refund even one dollar.,
"Thanks\"",,,,,
13684319,98728933,2016-09-01,79349763,Joseph,"Eunice was a great host. The room and the entire living area was kept clean, and she was always available to answer any questions."
7321217,45860535,2015-09-06,19810664,Blair,"Our few days at John's apartment in Charlestown were perfect! We were greeted with a nice note and bottle of wine from John! The house is beautiful and kept sparkling clean. We had no issues finding the building, or accessing the key. The place was just as described on his listing. The grill was fully stocked with gas and we enjoyed making dinner on the roof deck! I would highly recommend this listing if you are looking to be very close to Boston (train station very close) but in a calmer area outside the city."
"Only issue was parking (only an issue on weekdays...weekend parking was plentiful) but you can make it work if you read the signs and do a little searching for a spot. \"",,,,,
7321217,47536667,2015-09-20,7459625,Neil,Had a great stay at John's apartment on Bunker Hill .

And excellent transport links,the bus into town just across road .,,,,
Wish we'd booked longer .... Will next time .,,,,,
Many thanks,,,,,

7321217,48554075,2015-09-27,42279340,Juliane,Perfect stay! The apartment was cosy and clean - exactly what ist looked like at the pictures. Perfectly located to hit the city.
7321217,49792344,2015-10-06,469995,Jennifer,"We really enjoyed John's apartment. It was exactly like the photos depicted. The space was very inviting and relaxing. John graciously provided coffee, water, beer and a very nice bottle of wine as well as breakfast bars. The rooftop deck is amazing. It is so chill up there and the view is really nice. The neighborhood is very quaint and sleepy. A nice residential neighborhood to walk about in. I felt very safe walking at night. The Sullivan Square subway station is fairly close at a 5-10 minute walk. John was very responsive when I had questions or requests."
A few tips...,,,,,
Parking is a bit of a challenge during weekdays. Street parking is mostly residential permit parking 8am-8pm,M -F. There is 2 hour Visitor Parking beginning 8am-6pm,M-F at the beginning of Bunker Hill Street as well as on the street behind the apartment on Medford Street. If you plan on taking the subway into Boston to explore the town and leave the car (during the weekday),I would highly recommend parking at a lot. We found one that is directly across the street from the subway station that only cost $6.00 to park 6am-6am.,,
Highly recommend John's space and look forward to staying here again!,,,,,
"Thanks again John!\"",,,,,
7321217,51184708,2015-10-18,11213202,Sara,"We loved our stay at Johns apartment. The place was clean, light & bright.  John was a perfect host w/ just the right amount of communication. Charlestown is the perfect location, adorable & a short train ride or $7 Uber into the city."

7321217,70465928,2016-04-18,21191281,Stephen,I went up to Boston by myself for the weekend. John's place was perfect. Bunker Hill/ Charleston where he lives is very tranquil and you can get into the city in less than 30 minutes on the Orange Line. Or walk into the city in about 50 minutes. I enjoyed kicking  back and reading on the rood deck with it's 360 degree views!
7321217,70872423,2016-04-21,12338992,Hannah,John's apartment was so great. He was the perfect host and made us feel right at home. The apartment was in a good location and we enjoyed our stay thoroughly. Would definitely recommend John's apartment.

His apartment was comfortable and relaxing and we loved the rooftop deck!! I would highly recommend John's penthouse! Charlestown is so close to downtown boston!
7321217,80080877,2016-06-16,40902731,Marjorie,We loved our stay at Johns place. Great location and neighborhood. The roof is incredible with amazing views. Parking is very manageable and near by so no problems at all. Only down side we experienced was the noise from the construction infront of the building. Overall I really recommend this place. I will stay there again.. Thank you John.
7321217,80994993,2016-06-20,8960808,Daniel,"John was a great communicator and provided a great all round Airbnb experience.  His apartment is wonderfully styled and very comfortable in every respect. Bunker hill is a really beautiful part of the city, and a great place to spend a few hours exploring. We particularly liked the fact that there is a 'Whole Foods' nearby so we had everything we needed for a perfect stay. Thanks so much for having us John."

2301709,11266183,2014-03-27,2312436,Krystyn,Great place to stay! The apartment is super clean & Will was very accommodating to our needs. We were here for 5 (cold!) nights in March & everything was perfect. The rooftop deck was amazing but sadly it was too cold to actually spend much time up there. Location is good- about a block away from Boston Medical and super close to restaurants & shops. All in all we had a wonderful experience & would definitely recommend staying here!
2301709,11683684,2014-04-12,1579256,Laura,"Overall, this was a great apartment.  Nice area and the Orange line is about 1/2 mile away and an easy walk.  It was great for us  - two adults and three kids (14, 12 & 11).  To keep it simple, here are the pros and cons:"
PROS,,,,,
-Very well-kept and clean apartment.,,,,,
-We found some excellent restaurants and coffee shops nearby (walking distance).,,,,,
-Property management group was very responsive.  There was a leak in the air mattress (actually two holes),and after our morning call to them,a new air mattress was in the apartment when we came back that evening.  Very impressed.,,,
-Washer and dryer on-site and in the apartment.,,,,,
-Roof deck was beautiful.,,,,,
-Quiet neighbors,,,,,
-Orange line 1/2 mile away,green line 1.0 mile away.,,,,
CONS:,,,,,
-Four flights of stairs.,,,,,
-It can get a little noisy at night,especially on Friday and Saturday nights,with a major street right around the corner,as well as a hospital right down the street,,
As you can see,I listed many more positive things about this apartment since it really is a pretty nice place,"and made our trip to Boston an enjoyable one.\"",,,

2301709,25013076,2015-01-05,3633975,Dhruv,Great two bed room split level in a lovely neighbourhood. I just as described. The only downside is that access to the apartment is via 4 flights of stairs and no elevator. That's fine if you're not traveling with lots of bags.
2301709,25432430,2015-01-16,22215496,Virginia,"El departamento está muy bien ubicado y es muy cómodo. Está muy bien amueblado y tiene detalles que hacen muy cómoda la estadía para un turista.

Toutefois,vous aurez plus l'impression de louer un appartement-hotel qu'un Airbnb. L'appartement est totalement impersonnel et vous ne croisez à aucun moment les propriétaires. Cela s'éloigne un peu de ma conception de la location par Airbnb.,,,,

2301709,27645740,2015-03-09,6321862,Adam,Our group arrived for a convention in Boston and stayed four nights. The apartment was as pictured in the unit profile and suited our needs (two couples and a single.) Here's a quick rundown of the pros/cons:
Positives:,,,,,
- Great neighborhood,centrally located; offering great restaurants,coffee shops & diners all within walking distance.,,,
- Unit has been completely updated within the past few years. Offering new stainless steel appliances,bathroom fixtures,etc.,,,
- Great patio/deck offering amazing views of Boston! Perfect during spring/summer/fall.,,,,,
- Property Manager was very responsive in dealing with any & all issues.,,,,,
- Graciously accommodated us in regards to storing our luggage pre-checkin and post-checkout. Which saved us a huge headache/hassle & freed us up to explore the city.,,,,,
Negatives:,,,,,
- Apartment wasn't cleaned at check-in (4:00pm) and after calling & requesting it to be cleaned the unit was still being cleaned at 7:30pm when we departed for dinner.,,,,,
- It seems as if the water might be shared between units,as after one person's shower one morning,the rest were tepid at best.,,,
Head's Up:,,,,,
- The unit is a fourth floor walk up,meaning if you have suit cases it can be quite the cardio workout.,,,,
- The unit is part of a Short Term Rental group,making it feel more like a hotel then a cozy,"personalized home.\"",,,

N'attendez donc vraiment pas une expérience Airbnb dans la mesure où il s'agit un appartement impersonnel avec une série de régles strictes couplées à diverses amendes si les régles ne sont pas respectées (genre late check out).

2301709,62253239,2016-02-13,53189090,Alan,This is a lovely apartment in a convenient location close to downtown Boston.   The apartment is clean and well furnished with modern appliances and includes a roof garden with excellent views.  The space is ideal for a family of 4/5.  The apartment is located at the top of the building and there is no elevator so be prepared to climb up to 50 steps to get to it.
2301709,62632539,2016-02-15,21304812,Daniel,The listing was accurate and apartment was as shown.  The apartment was clean and all the amenities were provided.  Great location and easy to get around.  Would definitely recommend staying here on your next trip to Boston
2301709,64613010,2016-03-06,54390148,Zoe,It was pleasant and lovely place. Will definitely recommend to friends and families.

Total begeistert von allem (vorallem dachterrasse),,,,,
Sauber,,,,,
Super tapasbar und bestes frühstück gleich um die ecke mit locals,,,,,
"Einkaufsmöglichkeiten für kleine besorgungen um die ecke\"",,,,,
2301709,75314222,2016-05-20,32790273,Xuanqing,Professional host. the house is located in a quite area. Quite convenience to visit around with uber. The apartment is very clean and spacious. The management is professional. Definitely a great place to stay for a family trip. Keep in mind that there's no elevator in this building and the apartment is located on the third floor.
2301709,77942578,2016-06-04,63251514,Lauren,A great place! The photos provided are an accurate representation of the apartment. The roof top patio was a highlight. The apartment is modern and came very clean. Check-in was easy. Nice restaurants and coffee shops North and East of the apartment but felt more comfortable walking with a group vs alone at night. There a lots of stairs to carry up your suitcases but worth the effort. Would rent again next time in Boston!
2301709,79797001,2016-06-14,74436747,Sophie,"The apartment was absolutely lovely and very clean - exactly as described and represented in the photos.  Getting into the building is straightforward, using the entry code that was provided by email. The neighbourhood is great - loads of really nice restaurants and bars nearby."
2301709,88018532,2016-07-22,864824,Heike,"The apartment is nice, in good condition and as shown in the photos.  It is on a quiet street in the South End. It is a little on the edge of the South End vs. in the heart of it, just a block from busier Mass Ave, and the neighborhood deteriorates once you cross it."
The apartment was spacious and clean,"although I'd stop short of \"\"spotless\"\". The kitchen is OK for takeout and very minor cooking",but it is not as well equipped as I had hoped: There was no dish detergent,sponges,only one roll of TP per bathroom,etc. When I asked the host about availability of these things
A real plus is parking right next to the building. This is hard to find in Boston,and was reasonably priced.,,,,
The roof deck is great,a nice place for breakfast or drinks in the evening. Note that the indoor dining area is just bar stools on the cooking counter,no table.  Again,this is OK for takeout,"not great if you've cooked a meal .\"",
2301709,88421223,2016-07-24,43366304,Rezwan,Exactly as advertised. Awesome location and great place to stay in Boston.
14388025,92660605,2016-08-09,87496033,Chris,Overall great experience. Clean room/bathroom. Great location. Very comfortable air mattress. Would easily recommend.
14388025,93111230,2016-08-11,42803980,Hayes,Kate was a great host. If I stay in Boston again and use air bnb I would book her place. Great location and hospitality.
14388025,95021530,2016-08-18,88067073,Crystal,"Kate was proactive in making sure I made it safely from the airport to her house, as I've never been to Boston before. She also invited me to join her and her friends for dinner my first night in the city. Her inclusion certainly made me feel welcome and she was always available if I had any questions (she's very knowledgeable and honest about worthwhile tourist attractions and public transportation), yet gave me my space and freedom to do my own thing. Her room was cozy and comfortable, clean and smells like the amazing Wildflower Honey candle on her writing desk. I recommend anyone who wants a home away from home in Boston to stay with Kate. Thank you for the wonderful experience!"
14388025,95980900,2016-08-21,23527061,Antoine,If your are looking for the perfect room to live in Boston few days...come here !
Kate is always available to give you some advice and she gave us a warm welcome.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
14388025,96811157,2016-08-24,52393367,Joshua,"Kate was a wonderful host!  I found that navigating from her home was an enjoyable experience.  My goal was to try to get a feel for the Boston area, and Kate's cozy home enabled me to do that.  She was very hospitable in a relaxed unobtrusive way; offering advice and insight on different locations within the area.  My stay was short and sweet, but I'm glad I went with Kate's place."
14388025,97552321,2016-08-27,57197256,Steve,"\"Kate was great. She received me and clued me in. It is a \"\"share"
14388025,97788062,2016-08-28,18790745,Anthony,Great location. Nearby many attractions while being in a quiet area. Shopping to the south at Prudential Center and you can walk near the river and other parks. Kate was a great host.
14388025,98121624,2016-08-29,50177874,Josef,"Although Kate was busy during my short time in Boston, she was very easy to communicate with to find the place, get myself settled and fairly flexible departure the next day. She's laid back, very friendly and her place is comfortable and in a very convenient part of the city. Would stay with her anytime and highly recommend to other travelers :)"
14388025,99094148,2016-09-03,89214651,Daria,"The apartment was clean and cozy and it is also located in very good place. Kate was always ready to help us, so I can recommend this apartment."
14388025,99341596,2016-09-04,14886844,Rafaela,"I came just for the weekend with my cousin and this location is prime for exploring and night life! Kate was super sweet and her place is cute and clean as well! She made sure we had clean sheets, towels and toiletries when we arrived. The air mattress was pretty comfortable too! 10/10 would recommend"
4080000,19915702,2014-09-20,12711808,Cameron,Great room.  Clean and the location is a block away from the subway to and from Logan.
4080000,19990979,2014-09-21,21462653,Anastasia,"Great location and room! The bed was comfortable, the towels and the room were clean. The shower and the bathroom were also really nice - we really loved the shower in the bathroom - it's so big and warm. The process of checking in and out was very well explained and easy."
The only thing that bothered us a little is that we could hear everything going on in the room next to us. I think the house was redesigned to be hotel-like so there used to be a door between these two rooms. Otherwise,a very pleasant experience,"would totally recommend. \"",,,
4080000,20255293,2014-09-26,20359960,Lee,My stay was very good. Everything went extremely smooth. Check-in and check-out was made simple and the directions were excellent. The room was clean as well as the bathroom. I had minimal interaction with the other guests as I was downtown most of the time. I would recommend this room for the person that needs a place to sleep and shower.
4080000,20383366,2014-09-28,21146376,Jure,"This stay was perfect, the room was even better than  on pictures, everything well organised. Subway is near . Respect to Quinn."
4080000,20727225,2014-10-04,21702197,Olivia,"This was my first experience using Airbnb . I can say it was what I expected. I needed a room in a jam as my friend was flying in a few days early and the rooms were insane in Boston , my car hasn't made it from California and I work far North Mass . My room was booked prompt and efficiently . My friend and I arrived very late due to her plane delay . There was some confusion on which room was mine bc my name wasn't on the list . I texted Quinn and told him the mix up . I awoke at 7 am the following day and we figured it out . The walls are very thin but the room is just like the pics , no deception . There was also a note left for me asking for an additional fee for my second guest , I was a tad confused bc I had put that in my search and indicated in my original message when inquiring the room . Like I said I'm brand new , so maybe that's just how it is . Very short walk to the T ( it would be pointless to drive ) and a great Mexican restaurant we had tacos at everyday we stayed .   Overall it was a good stay"
4080000,20803833,2014-10-05,20019108,Pieter,"Nice and clean apartment, very close to the subway! Only drawback is that you hear the persons staying in the other room very well since the wall is mainly a former sliding door. Other then that a good place. Great value for money!"
4080000,20933441,2014-10-07,16877137,Vanessa,"Even we haven't seen Quinn-May, it was a nice stay and the room was clean and comfortable."
4080000,21047169,2014-10-10,21416982,Janee,"I flew into Boston one evening and left for Maine the next morning, so I was just looking for a place to sleep.  The Orient House is very conveniently located; I was able to hop on the blue line from the airport for a couple of stops and walk less than a block to get there.  I had a comfortable stay and didn't have any problems."
4080000,21174023,2014-10-12,7931654,Kishore & Deeksha,The room is very clean and spacious. It was perfect for our 1 night since we were just passing through and the shared bathroom is kept clean. If you are driving it makes sense to be aware of parking rules around the place but it was not hard to figure out. Very easy access to the T if needed and so close to the airport.
4080000,21310259,2014-10-14,21930485,Sonja,Alle Beschreibungen waren wahrheitsgetreu. Gute Beschreibung des Weges vom Flughafen bis zur Unterkunft. Sehr gute Lage und ein ruhiges sicheres Quartier.
4080000,21500148,2014-10-18,22589227,Kennie,Everything was as stated. It is a locked room inside a larger home where tenants share the bathroom and kitchen. This is perfect for a place to sleep close to the airport.
4080000,21614610,2014-10-20,17266689,Jerry,Had a great time. Nice clean and great aces to the subway to get anywhere in the city.

Belle chanbre très propre,,,,,
Plusieurs salle de bain très propre et récente avec serviette,,,,,

C'était parfait!!!,,,,,
"Merci à quinn\"",,,,,
4080000,21914390,2014-10-26,22568678,Kyra,Great place to stay the night and very easy to find! Very clean and spacious room. We were only in Boston for the night but it was so close to the subway that we could take it anywhere. Extremely convenient and reasonable for Boston.
4080000,22052696,2014-10-28,22895771,Bingqing,"We had a great experience. The room was clean and with fine furnitures, it's the same with the picture you can see on website. We even have a normal size refrigerator in the room. The host is so nice, he showed us around the house and gave us many recommendation for our visit."
4080000,22277543,2014-11-02,22608112,Dan,Clean and welcoming room within SECONDS walk of the train to get you to downtown/historic spots/Cambridge/Fenway park.
More than one clean bathroom and great showers as well as a kitchen with cold filtered water on tap. The neighbourhood is pleasant with a couple of nice cafés and shops.,,,,,
I look forward to staying again,"Quinn!\"",,,,
4080000,22511950,2014-11-08,1113550,Mark,Accurate.  Good written instructions. Quite.  Never actually saw another person while I was staying there.
4080000,23232970,2014-11-25,23992272,Gene Xin Tian,"Nice place! literally just few seconds of walk to the subway. Exactly like how it is in the picture. Quiet and peaceful neighbourhood. We didnt get to meet Mr Quinn May as he was away but he was very nice, always responding in a short time whenever i asked him questions . Very clean room and bathroom. Enjoyed our stay there!"
4080000,24714588,2015-01-02,552500,Thanachart,The place's quality is average for this price point. But we had a hard time sleeping in the room due to the loud noise of the in-room refrigerator and light coming through a thin window curtain.
4080000,27684706,2015-03-09,28073913,Martin,"Very pleasant place, had everything we needed and more, a very good experience, would come back."
4080000,28690565,2015-03-28,8836925,Tim,"The room is ok and clean, but very small."
In the narrow corridor there was a heavy smell of deodorant.,,,,,
Surprisingly,the bathroom and kitchen were clean and fine.,,,,
A pack of disposable forks and spoons would come handy.,,,,,
Close to subway. Not noisy. Except for the people in other small rooms near your one.,,,,,
"But if you plan to stay for more than one night and can pay a bit more - you might want to reconsider.\"",,,,,
4080000,28854429,2015-03-30,30079968,Krystal,"The room was spotless and had plenty of space for me and the two other people I was traveling with. It was really cold and snowy when I visited, but the room was warm and comfortable. We had to check in after midnight and the hosts were very accommodating to our hectic last-minute travel plans. I never met the hosts, but they provided us with everything that we needed and made it easy to check in and out. They approved my request for the room almost immediately, and they responded to all of my messages promptly no matter what time of day it was. There were two bathrooms and a nice shower, and even though there were people who were staying in the other rooms in the house, everyone was relatively quiet and kept to themselves. Great experience!"
4080000,30178563,2015-04-18,4136165,Andrew,The space was good for what I needed. The check-in was easy and the host was quite flexible and very communicative.
I hadn't realized that the bathroom was shared with several other rooms. But I didn't have any trouble. In fact,I didn't see any other guests while I was there.,,,,

4080000,30445241,2015-04-22,11840758,Karen,"We had a great stay at Quinn May's place. Everything was very clean and well-kept, and it was quiet and spacious. There were other guests there throughout our stay but it felt very much like our own place! The area is also nice and it's away from the hustle and bustle of Boston without being too far away."
4080000,31682835,2015-05-08,30312020,Yingzhu,The room was clean and spacious. Close to blue line. Enough room for three people to stay. The host was very nice. I would recommend this place to stay.
4080000,31754831,2015-05-09,30312020,Yingzhu,"The room was spacious, clean and neat. Enough space for three people to fit in. Good place to stay."
4080000,32783307,2015-05-21,33080302,Hongxia,"The host is very considerate- she already provided us the route from the station to the apartment. The room is exactly as it is shown in the picture. Though there is no bathroom in the room, the room itself is clean and well-prepared."
4080000,33382400,2015-05-27,31943030,Bokun,Absolutely a great place to stay!
4080000,33581717,2015-05-30,30508869,Yijun,"全程都没有见到房东,不过房东把所有需要的都放在信箱和房间内。房间很宽敞,住3人没问题。厨房和卫生间设备齐全卫生。位置很有优势,离地铁仅步行5分钟,同时可以到达食品超市。看地图离海滩不远,可惜没有时间去。波士顿是个温馨舒适的中等城市,各方面都很方便,并且有很强的历史文化气息。值得一游,住在这里也是好选择。"
4080000,33839389,2015-06-01,4773828,Lindsay,My wife and daughter spent the weekend here and enjoyed their stay very much. The room was very clean and they had everything they needed. There were guests in the other rooms but the noise from the other guests was very minimal. We definately recommend this location and would not hesitate to stay here again.
4080000,34836901,2015-06-12,35414666,Jackie,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay. Our room was very clean, comfortable and spacious. The house was large and had several other rooms with guests but we didn't see anyone. It felt like we had the place to ourselves! It was a quiet and relaxed environment. We had a nice chat with Quinn, a friendly and hospitable host. Overall it was a great stay!"
4080000,35035723,2015-06-14,33761820,Brian,The house and bedroom were just as described.  The room was very clean and well prepared.  There were no issues with our late check-in and any answers to our questions were provided right out of the gate.  Thank you!
4080000,35400245,2015-06-18,1452430,Bernard,"Cecilia and I had connecting flights through Boston and needed a place to stay the next day, and May's property fit our purposes perfectly. It was convenient, and located close to the airport (just 2 stops away on the blue line, followed by a shuttle bus). Our room was clean, cozy, and comfortable; even though we did hear intermittent sounds form the room next to us, it wasn't anything that bothered us, and we had a really good night's sleep."
Due to our late arrival,we didn't get to meet May,"but she was gracious and provided all the information we needed to check-in. We would definitely consider coming back here the next time we are in Boston.\"",,,
4080000,36157535,2015-06-25,902435,Gergely,"well listed....  good location, shared facilities. Good value for the money."
4080000,37403169,2015-07-06,36751740,Caitlin,"Just what we needed. Easy to get in and out, basics such as towels and kitchen supplies were available. Having AC was incredible for our July visit, and we were able to drop off our bags before the check-in time."
4080000,38569008,2015-07-16,9652311,Ed,"Nice stay at a fair price.  Needed something close to the airport, and this was it.  My only disappointment was that the room was NOT AS PICTURED.  The second bed is a FUTON.  A FUTON that was very uncomfortable.  A FUTON w/STAINED SHEETS.   I understand things change, but either update the pic, or let the guest know.  Keys in mailbox with instructions.  Never met any host.  No welcoming at all."
Again,a good stay,"but without any personal hospitality.  \"",,,
4080000,39549964,2015-07-24,38083666,Brooke,"We were very happy with our stay! It was a great location (very close to the airport and easy to get there by bus/walk), and a very nice place. Everything was clean and cute.  I would definitely recommend it."
4080000,39932220,2015-07-27,5002813,Brigitte,"We were three and had very much space. Unfortunatly the room was a little shabby and the bathroom, which we had to share with other guests, was dirty, that we did not feel too comfortable. But the keys were easy to find and it's a good, silent place - ideal to go to boston-city and to the airport."
4080000,40293596,2015-07-29,3945733,Christina,"Well, you get what you pay for and unfortunately Boston is simply too expensive. But for a couple of hours staying only just before an early morning flight it is ok, sheets were clean, bathroom could have been cleaner."
4080000,40408348,2015-07-30,39656394,Evan,"Positives: Easy parking, easy check in, close to the airport, powerful AC."
Negatives: sandy sheets,"dirty floors.\"",,,,
4080000,40768238,2015-08-02,36595027,Slava,"A very clean and generally nice place. Admittedly we just slept on our overnight connection, but for that purpose it was perfect - close to the airport, clean, cozy, quiet, and the bed was really comfortable."
4080000,41296891,2015-08-05,423275,Tiberiu,"We had a great time staying at Quinn-May's place. The room was very nice and clean; the bathroom, shared between several rooms, was also clean. There is cheap parking ($5/day) just around the corner, at the T station."
4080000,41876155,2015-08-09,39965783,Benjamin,The listing description and directions from airport were accurate.
4080000,42318656,2015-08-12,24447109,Abhishek,It was a very good stay. The room was comfortable. It was located near a very good seafood restaurant. Overall I would recommend you to stay at this place.
4080000,44667980,2015-08-28,39201296,Harvey,"The location was convenient, close to Blue Line metro station. Room was clean and quiet with on-street parking out front. Restaurants and pizza joint a short walk away."
4080000,45170719,2015-08-31,41426604,Chengzhu,"Perfect location, near the beach, 5 minutes walk to the nearest subway station. The room is clean and has all the necessities. Although we checked out late, they took care of our stuff and had it all settled. The price is fair, so nothing to complain about."
4080000,45515744,2015-09-03,37400475,Chris,"First and foremost, this a boarding house, and not the hosts home, so you won't be hanging out with them in all likelihood."
The place is an a wonderful location,a 2 minute walk from the MBTA train station,making it really easy to get either to or from downtown and the airport.,,,
When we arrived,the previous guests had mistaken their 12pm check-out to mean midnight,so hadn't yet moved out (nor were they present),but all this was sorted as quickly as possible and with a minimum of fuss.,,
There are 2 kitchens here,"however only the upstairs option is fully equipped.\"",,,,
4080000,45630903,2015-09-04,8236837,Franz,"I did not meet the host.  However, he did make sure to provide good directions to house and the key to his unit was right where he said it would be."

4080000,46782188,2015-09-13,42417840,Daniel,"This is a nice house in a good location. As other have stated, this is a boardinghouse, so you probably won't meet the owners. However, the check-in process was easy and clear. The bathrooms are shared with several other rooms, but with two bathrooms on my floor (and four other rooms, only two of which were occupied during my stay), I never had any problems getting an open bathroom. The house is in a quiet, working-class neighborhood in East Boston, and is two blocks away from a train to downtown Boston. I would stay here again."
4080000,47512162,2015-09-19,41956023,Nikita,"The housing is very pleasant, cosy, it's situated in a calm area and also in 2 minutes from subway) Everything was like in a description, it is very clean. We were really very delighted with this room)"

4080000,49674959,2015-10-05,44209569,Elisabeth,"Overall the place was basic but clean. There was some confusion over the keys (they were not where the host said they would be) but we figured this out on our own. There were multiple rooms at this location (we rented just one), two shared bathrooms, and a shared kitchen. Unlike the room pictured, we did not have two beds; we had a bed and a creaky futon, which was a disappointment. The place was quite ample for our needs (a place to sleep near the airport), and it was clean and a decent value."

4080000,50217263,2015-10-10,43977942,Karin,The accommodation was dirty and unacceptable. The refrigerator was so smelly we could not use it. There was mildew in shower curtain.
4080000,51549933,2015-10-21,44048578,Lina,"因为是中国人的房子,我们认为交流起来很合适。但是很少服务的意识,可能是因为他们是研究工作人员的缘故。但是,房东很好,一切很紧急。我们很享受这次经历。只是如果可以每天有咖啡提供就更加完美了。"

4080000,76482898,2016-05-27,19197684,Junkai,"This is a very very impressive place to stay!  It is pretty close to the local transit.  All stuff is carefully prepared.  The room is well equipped, and is very clean.  I recommend this place!"

4080000,80151462,2016-06-16,74920288,Kent,It was great that we were able to find a place close to Boston Logan Int'l Airport. Just a few minutes walk to the blue line. The beds were comfy and the A/C unit kept us cool. Access to the place was easy as well as checking out. We did not meet the owners of the house.
4080000,81129089,2016-06-21,73307829,Martina,"I stayed here for 4 nights with my parents and since it was our very first airbnb experience, we were pretty nervous about everything, but we were so so so satisfied! The location was easy to find from the metro and since we love airplanes, we walked to the harbor and beach (5 min from the house) every day to watch them landing! Amazing location and clean place, quiet and friendly. We had a code for entering the house and had no problem at all. I slept on the spare bed and it was also just fine for me. It was good to have a clean fridge in the room and all the nessecary stuff in the kitchen. Oh and there were 2 bathrooms! Super comfy."

4080000,84195798,2016-07-06,80063811,Andrew,"The room was very comfortable, as well as clean. The location was fantastic because we were able to able to walk 2 minutes across the street to take the 15 minute train ride into Boston. The group staying in the room across the hall were very loud on the last night of our stay however, but that didn't take away from our experience. We will definitely be back!"
4080000,89032858,2016-07-26,79944249,William,Room 71-5 and Room 71-1 are next to the main road so it is a little annoying by the transportation noise.
4080000,90837766,2016-08-02,47684950,Philippe,The appartment is really super located. 5 minutes walk to metro than 10 minutes to Boston downtown. The room was huge with 2 beds. Defenitly a place to recommend when visiting Boston.
4080000,92663856,2016-08-09,67611381,Fabrizio,"Nice stay. Place is clean and comfy. We didn't meet the renters, but everything goes smoothly. 2 bathroom to be shared with other 5 rooms were clean and ok. Great deal, very close to the T subway."
4080000,93359586,2016-08-12,62036087,志鸿,This place is close to the airport but quiet at night. The room is large and clean and there is a fridge in it.
4080000,93972530,2016-08-14,31603126,Amanda,"Quinn-May's place was great! Basically a boarding house with a bunch of rooms of varying sizes. We didn't actually meet him, but the house was clean, easily accessible, and May was available to answer questions before our arrival."
"Would definitely recommend for a stay in Boston!\"",,,,,
4080000,94911993,2016-08-17,81910187,Kerry,"As others mentioned, this is kind of a boardinghouse experience. It was close to public transportation, clean inside, though the entryway was littered with cigarette butts. It was a good deal for the price. We had planned on sightseeing all day and just sleeping at the house, so that worked out great."
22208,90778,2010-09-05,202612,Kavita,"Thank you seamlesstransition , The apartment was clean and comfortable and well located, and I would recomend it to my friends."

27611,13314332,2014-05-25,14245489,David,"Had a good experience with the host and the apartment. The apartment was what I expected and very clean. The neighborhood was pleasant and very quiet, with shops, restaurants and grocery within walking distance. The bed could only be accessed from one side, so a bit tricky for two. The host understood and had plans to fix the situation. A rating of 41/2."
27611,15986206,2014-07-19,7049774,Sean,"I had a good experience staying here.   The owners are very gracious and the apartment is really nice!  -- It's like a dollhouse.  Would be perfect to stay in during the cold winter months, but relies on fans to keep you cool and move the air during the humid boston summer."
Great to for a single person who wants to live life as a local and knows the city--(i was traveling for work and used to live in boston).  Excellent location in JP.  Close to lots of cool stuff over there.,,,,,

Keith was an excellent host who gave me the space I needed but was always available. A quiet and lovely retreat feeling both in the house and the host!,,,,,
I have a car and travel to Boston every week. I know West Roxbury well and the neighborhood is quite safe. You will definitely want a car here,the bus is not always the best option. But if you do have a car,"I highly recommend staying here!\"",,,

Keith was there to welcome us as we pulled up and he and Beth were quick to offer up tips and suggestions to help us navigate Boston during the very busy Harborfest weekend. The room was spacious and very well kept and the next door bathroom had all the comforts you could ever want. They even went the extra mile and had toys, books and a pack and play available for our 18 month old, which we very much appreciated. The location was great, close to downtown but far enough away to be quiet and relaxing if you just wanted to recover from downtown craziness. Couldn't have asked for more, do yourself a favor and book here, you won't be disappointed."

You can ask everything to Keith, he gave us a coupon code for a taxi app and gave us the directions to the nearest supermarket. The communication was nice and the room and the bathroom were really clean. I highly recommend this Airbnb. This was the best Airbnb experience we ever had! Thanks Keith and Beth!"

It had the charming feel of traditional Boston mixed with the comfort of modern upgrades...especially in the bathroom. We were highly impressed with the shower and towel warmer, not to mention the softness of the towels. This may not be significant to some but to someone with sensitive skin, it was greatly appreciated. The room was very spacious, beautifully decorated and clean. Keith greeted us upon arrival and offered great suggestions for dining. We only saw Beth for a split second but she embodied a warm smile. They both were very hospitable, allowing us to bring my nephew at the last minute. Overall, great place to stay...very warm and inviting...wish we could have stayed longer! Highly recommend!"

We chose this house for its location,and weren't disappointed. On-property parking was a big plus,and since the house was just a two-minute walk from the Centre Street restaurants and the T stop,we didn't need to use the car. In fact,we walked to Boston on the Southwest Corridor trail that starts just a few blocks from the house.,
Andrew's clear instructions and instant responses to every question made it easy to check in and out.,,,,,

House is well equipped, street is quiet. An oasis of peace."

Andrew could not have been more helpful -- very quick to respond to our initial inquiry and to all questions thereafter; plus he gave us good recommendations for some places to eat.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend it.  I hope to go back again sometime. In fact, I threatened to move in and never leave, I liked it so much."

The house is extraordinarily stylish, clean, and comfortable-- every detail was perfect! It is no exaggeration to say we felt we had stepped into a hip boutique hotel featured in a design magazine."
I lived in Jamaica Plain for eight years before moving away three years ago and can attest that it is the BEST neighborhood in the city,especially for visitors interested in art,nature,and eating/drinking/shopping locally. Andrew's home is a prime location-- steps away from the 39 bus or a beautiful ten minute walk from the Green Street T stop. I was able to walk to all my favorite old haunts: Salmagundi,VeeVee,James' Gate
Andrew was an excellent host-- he responded quickly to communications,answered all our questions,and is clearly takes his commitments to guests seriously. Thanks,"Andrew(URL HIDDEN) \"",,

Our friend liked the place so much he said he would be willing to stay here solo next time he is in Boston. The house is located between two T-Orange line stops. We took the Forest Hills stop the first day and then the more chill Green St. stop the next day. We met several neighbors - all incredibly friendly!!!

2308630,38019838,2015-07-12,36360337,Rophe,The apartment was true to pictures and in such a great location! The neighborhood was great and lots of entertainment close by and transpiration near by! Andrew and JoAnna truly make the space feel like your own. Highly recommend a stay here!
2308630,39001200,2015-07-20,31693332,Roy,Andrew's place is just outstanding. When we entered the home we were blown away and instantly felt at home. My wife and another couple stayed in their place for a long weekend and loved every bit of our stay in their home. The neighborhood very pleasant and the town of Jamaica Plain had a lot to offer. Great access to the T and a Hubway station within a 5 min walk from their home. The spare room is a bit tight on space but it was still cozy and the bed was comfortable.  If you have a chance to stay here don't pass it up.
2308630,40357125,2015-07-30,36345545,Jean Antoine,We have spent very pleasant days in this charming flat. It is cozy and the neighborhood is nice.

The only problem I encountered was that the orange line was not running at the nearby station,"the weekend that I was there. \"",,,,

The apartment was exactly as described and shown in the photos. Apartment is on a beautiful street in a safe, residential neighborhood - great for strolling. The apartment is very cozy, adorable and spacious. Kitchen was great for cooking - equipped with all the amenities. Two queen size beds are very comfortable (fun to sleep in a Murphy bed). We stayed with my partner's parents and the apartment offered a sense of privacy and good communal space both."

The apartment is lovely - very spacious,clean and well maintained.,,,,
The kitchen was extremely well equipped.  Great lay-out of the apartment.  Excellent tv.,,,,,
The apartment is on a very quiet,residential street - 5 minutes walk from shops,bakery,restaurants,etc.  Lovely neighbourhood.  Great location - very close to the subway.,
It was great having parking at the rear of the property.,,,,,
The only drawback was the lack of cupboard/wardrobe space in the main bedroom,and very limited hanging space in the second bedroom.,,,,
Apart from this,"would recommend this apartment.\"",,,,

2308630,67237366,2016-03-27,26412720,Sherry,"My boyfriend and I had a great experience at Andrew and JoAnna's apartment! Although we didn't actually get to meet them, they were both very accommodating via text and answered all our questions right away. The place is beautiful just like you see in the photos, very spacious (now wishing our NY apartment is as big, haha), neat, and overall there really are no complaints!"
295285,4717483,2013-05-21,6275437,Jeremy,"Tom was a pleasant host and was extremely helpful in informing us about the public transit and local attractions. He was always available for questions and was prompt in response. His home was clean and the queen bed was comfortable. Overall, we enjoyed our stay."
295285,5001188,2013-06-06,6605055,Vi,"Tom has been such a pleasant host, always been so helpful, and informative. He tried to help out whenever he could even with his busy work schedule. My family had a very good time, and comfortable staying here. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. And there's always parking around the area, not as hectic as some other places in Boston. It's a way better alternative than staying at the hotel. I'm glad I chose his place. And I'm sure anyone who decides to stay here will love Tom as a host for his generosity and hospitality."
295285,10438636,2014-02-18,8255708,Kristina,"Peaceful place to stay in a great Boston neighborhood, and being able to park the car in the driveway is very handy, particularly in a Boston winter!  Tom is at the same time a friendly and unobtrusive host.   Made for a very comfortable weekend."
295285,11513051,2014-04-06,10158725,Carla,"I had a lovely stay with Tom; between his graciousness, the location (neighbourhood, proximity to T) it was as close to perfect as it can get, and I was a little sad to leave there."
295285,13214834,2014-05-22,14124233,Sean,Tom is a gracious and accommodating host.  I highly recommend the neighborhood and residence
295285,19364234,2014-09-11,17626942,Dale,"The listing was accurate and the neighborhood couldn't be nicer, glorious weather with open space, good transport links and friendly neighbors make this a very nice place to stay."
Tom was a great host,I stayed for 6 weeks which is longer than the average AirBnB guest but during the whole time Tom was approachable,friendly and helpful. When the dryer broke due to a failed belt Tom took all of my laundry to the nearest Laundromat and had it back in under an hour - talk about helpful!,,,
West Roxbury is a little out of the way but the area is very nice,one can easily make it anywhere in Boston in a maximum of 90 minutes,with it only taking an hour to get into central Boston (or 20 minutes on the weekdays via the commuter rail).,,,
"I would definitely recommend both Tom and his home as a place to stay while you visit Boston!\"",,,,,

295285,23594291,2014-12-06,8919230,Frank,"Die Unterkunft war genau wie beschrieben. Das Haus liegt in einer wunderschönen Ecke in West Roxbury, mit ruhiger und sicherer Nachbarschaft. Die Anbindung an das öffentliche Verkehrsnetz ist gegeben und der Weg ins Zentrum nicht allzu weit. Ein Auto kann, wie überall in den USA, aber auf keinen Fall schaden. Ein kostenoser Parkplatz steht in der Einfahrt oder vor dem Haus zur Verfügung."
Im Haus sind alle beschriebenen Dinge,wie Waschmaschine,Trockner,vollausgestattete Küche mit Geschirrspüler,Fernseher und W-Lan Internet vorhaben.,
Tom selbst ist ein Pfundskerl. Mit seiner freundlichen und zuvorkommenden Art hat er es geschafft,dass man sich direkt ab der Ankunft wohl gefühlt hat. Bereits vor meiner Ankunft fragte er mich ob er irgnedwas Spezielles für mich einkaufen solle. Egal ob ich beim Einrichten meines Mobiltelefons oder der Paketbeförderung Hilfe benötigte. Tom war immer zur Stelle und half wo er konnte.,,,,
Zusammengefasst hatte ich eine rundum wunderschöne Zeit in der Keith Street,an die ich mich noch in sehr vielen Jahren mit Freude zurückerinnern werde.,,,,

"Tom was a very polite host and everything is exactly like mentioned in the listing. I´ve had a grea time and I will remember it forever and ever. I can highly recommend it. I´m pretty sure teat you will have an awesome time as well.\"",,,,,
295285,33798097,2015-06-01,28159234,Ross,"I stayed with Tom for about six weeks, as I was finishing up broadcasting school. From day one, he was a great host and always made me feel welcome. He was friendly and accommodating. His house is in a great location in West Roxbury. It is close to the city but it feels like you are a little out of the hustle and bustle. The house itself was just what I needed, with a nice big bedroom for me with plenty of storage too for my things. I would highly recommended staying with Tom if you are visiting Boston!"
295285,43807157,2015-08-22,32989249,Svetlana,"We've stayed in this place for a month. Tom is a wonderful host. He made sure we had everything we need, offered us a drive to the supermarket and showed us around. Absolutely recommend!"
295285,44612776,2015-08-27,39879492,Laurence,"Tom's house is located in a quiet and lovely neighborhood . The room is cozy and clean, exactly as depicted in the profile. Besides you have access to T, which will take u to the   Subway and downtown. Tom is very hospitable and nice. It was a pleasure choose his house during my short stay in Boston."
295285,49206504,2015-10-02,21710204,Martin,"We stayed with Tom in bedroom no. 2 for one month. Tom was a great host, always helpful and doing anything to let us feel comfortable. As we had no car at times, Tom was ready to give us a lift if there was anything we needed. He as well got stuff we needed for us and always took care whether things were going all right for us. The room was tidy as was the house. Room is exactly as depicted on the photos. Bath room is shared, but that never turned out to be a problem. We had the opportunity to use kitchen and laundry machine, which was very kind. Free WIFI was included. The neighbourhood is quite quiet, but public transport is available even at night and you can feel very safe in this area and on public transport. Supermarket, post office, gas station, cash machines only a few minutes by car. We had a great time at Tom’s house and would very much recommend a stay with him."
295285,50704749,2015-10-13,33755644,Vy,"Tom is nice and responsive. The house is clean and as described. There was a TV in our room, so we could watch movies at night during our stay. Quiet and safe neighborhood, a little bit far from downtown but public transportation is available (just a few blocks away). Tom respects our privacy and even offered to drop us off at Forest Hill station when we said we gonna take uber to go there."
295285,51256825,2015-10-18,5285358,George,Can't sing toms praises highly enough! An absolute gentleman and a great clean house. Everything worked great and Tom was kind enough to offer and take me to work in the morning twice! Will definitely stay here again in the future! Best Airbnb(er) going!
295285,51594110,2015-10-21,5285358,George,I ended up extending my stay with Tom. Absolutely A+++++ (please see my other review for more details)
295285,72349855,2016-05-02,54741616,Jeffrey,My girlfriend and I stayed at Tom's place for 2 months. From day one Tom made us feel at home.
We never lacked anything because Tom made sure we had it ahead of time.,,,,,

295285,77519853,2016-06-01,35148212,Chenyu,It was an absolute pleasure staying with Tom. He's such a gentleman and always willing to provide help. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. Tom kept the house very clean and generously shared everything with us. We would love to come back some day!
295285,95936536,2016-08-21,63114202,Matthew,"My stay at Tom's was very pleasant and comfortable! In addition to a very comfortable bed, the access to a stocked kitchen made a very good long-term arrangement. Lovely quiet neighborhood. Tom is a great guy who really went out of his way to make sure I wasn't lacking anything, and frequently offered to pick up supplies for me. He was also flexible with visitors crashing briefly, which saved me from booking hotels for a number of people over the summer. Very good value altogether!"
295285,99025656,2016-09-03,69544500,Hirokuni,This was my very first airbnb experience but I liked a stay at Tom's place. It was very quiet and clean. The house looked classic amd furniture looked nice. The bed was comfortable.

The room was really spacious, neat and met our standards. We found everything as listed on the site.  Natalia, was really helpful and was quick to respond to my messages typically within an hour. Although we did not meet her, we still felt comfortable and at home. I would recommend this place if you are visiting Boston!!"
10068240,59231514,2016-01-08,46482986,Lance,"Easy walk from Shawmut red-line station, even with luggage.  Neighborhood not very attractive but quiet.  Natalia was not there but very good about preparing me for getting-in to the building and was  responsive to my follow-up questions via text message.  Room was as-described.  Bedding and linens were excellent.  Place was pretty clean but bedroom and bathroom floor could have used a vacuum.  Room has old-fashioned steam radiator which was quite loud at times throughout the night, waking me up, but I did get some sleep.  House has at least 3 rentals but seems to have just 1 bathroom, shared by 6 people when I was there, so there was some unexpected waiting in the morning.  Overall, not a bad place if you're on a budget, but I have experienced bnb's of better value in Dorchester."
10068240,64921957,2016-03-09,11711799,Gregory,Natalia was a great host and she was very welcoming and helpful. The one night stay was just what we had hoped for. It was close to the airport and nestled in a comfortable neighborhood.
10068240,65819815,2016-03-17,35984506,Nabarjun,"Natalia was an awesome host, very lively, helpful and communicative! She made sure we settled down well and took care of any concerns we had. Her suggestions to explore the city, especially in the food/restaurants aspect are amazing, which really helped me. I'd recommend this place to anyone planning to visit Boston!"
10068240,66063359,2016-03-19,58944754,Leela,"Natalia was a wonderful host. Though she was not available when we arrived, she made sure we had everything we needed. She gave us some wonderful suggestions for the places we could visit in Boston which were not listed in Internet. The room was bigger than we thought. The location is pretty accessible with the local train station 10 mins away. We had a wonderful stay at Natalia's place."
10068240,67588703,2016-03-30,17891440,Katryne,"The 24-hour check in worked out great since we got stuck in traffic leaving Montreal and arrived much later than anticipated. Checking in was worry-free with the way accessing the house has been set up by Natalia. The house is easily reachable whether you're driving or taking public transit. We never had to look for street parking for long during the long weekend we spent at the house and the subway station is just a few minutes away if you're walking. We felt safe and the liquor store next door was perfect for those nights we were craving wine to accompany our meals when we stayed in. The house is lovely; old but clean. It always smelled fresh when we came back in the evenings. The room we stayed in (first one on the left on the top floor) was plenty spacious for the 5 of us. The clothing rack is a great addition in the room. The area was quiet at night which is good for anyone looking for a good nights sleep. Be aware that the bed is hard, you feel the mattress' springs. As for the air mattress, it deflates through the night so even though it's comfortable, you might end up waking up and having to inflate it again. The sofa-bed is definitely your best bet where sleep & comfort are concerned. Another factor to consider is the old radiator. It works but because it's old it makes quite a bit of racket at night. After the first 2 nights we ended up turning it off and using extra blankets. It was much better from then on. None of the bedroom doors have a lock. We didn't have any problem but it's important to mention it. We didn't have any towels the first night because the ones left in the bathroom had been taken by other guests already but we got them the next day when we ran into one of the housekeepers. There's only one bathroom for 4 rentals but it's advertised as such and we made it work. Just be aware that you're sharing the place with other guests and some unexpected situations might arise from it but be respectful, dare speak your mind if something displeases you and let Natalia or her go-to person know if a difficult situation or an emergency arise. Kitchen has the basics for you to cook and is kept clean. Because there are only 4 seats, you might wanna make sure your timing is spot on when cooking. Balcony is great and there's even a fire pit in the backyard! Also WiFi worked okay. Spotty at times but good overall. Natalia always replied within a day. Overall, it's a decent AirBnB."
10068240,68132171,2016-04-02,60305118,Monica,The room was great. Had extra blankets and pillows for comfort. Overall great experience.

10068240,70073063,2016-04-15,66358527,Collin,"The host was fantastic! I'd get in late and then leave early, so we kept missing each other, but eventually she tracked me down, knocked on my door, and we then were able to have a wonderful half-hour conversation. She answered all of my questions, and she told me all I wanted to know about Boston and the places I should visit. I felt at home after just a minute of speaking with her."
The house itself was very nice and cheery (I was just coming from New York,"so it also seemed gigantic in comparison to my NY bnb). \"",,,,
10068240,70673986,2016-04-19,5867516,James,"We stayed with Natalia for the Boston Marathon weekend, and it was all we could have asked for and more! The room, kitchen and bathroom were all spacious and clean, Natalia was very friendly and helpful, and the house is 20-25 minutes from the centre of town via the T."
10068240,71142638,2016-04-24,52875064,Shane,"Three of my friends and I stayed here over the weekend of PAX, and we had a wonderful time here! Was only a 5 minute walk from the subway station and is super easy to find, the local stores are all within a small area right around the corner of this location and the food around the area is pretty good."
We stayed in the room to the left on the top floor which was more than spacious for the four of us. The clothing rack was definitely a plus for the room. The bathroom and kitchen were well kept even when the place was fully occupied. Despite having to share the space with other guests,they were friendly and did there part to keep the place clean too.,,,,
Natalia was a wonderful host,came in and greeted us on the day we arrived and was very helpful,replying to my texts promptly whenever I had an issue.,,,

However, we cannot lock the room so we did feel a little bit of insecurity. Nevertheless we're safe and nothing's got stolen, so it's alright to me."
10068240,73602366,2016-05-08,57177122,Emilie,"On est resté 3 nuits dans ce Airbnb. Je n'ai pas vu Natalia mais elle m'a communiqué toutes les informations nécessaires pour arriver sur place. On est arrivé assez tôt donc on a pu poser nos affaires sans problème dans le salon, ce qui était très pratique. Le métro n'est pas très loin et le quartier est sympa mais résidentiel."

10068240,78854270,2016-06-09,75645314,Camille,We felt very welcome she was quick to answer out texts. Gave good instructions to get to her house. She let us check in as soon as we got to her house.

The place was fantastic.  It was just as it was descibed elegant, historic and sleek plus very clean.   Lots a space and just a really cool layout and design.  We loved the big pocket doors separating the leaving to the bedroom. There were several great restaurants within 1-2 blocks.  We took Uber into to the historic sites such as Faneuil Hall otherwise it would have been a 45-50 minute walk and at night that twas not an option for me.  The cost to do that each way was about $7-8 bucks.  Totally worth staying here and Ubering it in.   We will be back for sure.  5 stars!"

He was very available for any questions I had and very responsive.,,

Jim himself is incredibly responsive and welcoming. He met me to hand off keys and show me the ropes around the apartment. And he checked in periodically throughout the week. He also gave me some great local recommendations.,,,,,
The Beacon Hill location was ideal. The apartment is a 3ish-minute walk to the T. And it's smack in the middle of one of Boston's most beautiful neighborhoods,with adorable restaurants and shops to easily walk to.,,,,
"The apartment was perfect for my solo stay. But might be too small for anyone other than a couple or someone traveling alone. \"",,,,,

The apartment is compact but cosy for a couple or single person. It is clean, tastefully furnished and sufficiently equipped. The location is ideal for transport, shops and restaurants and the area is pleasant and safe to take a stroll day or night. We often walked through Boston Common to Newbury Street and Copley which took about 25 minutes. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others."

7614517,54120139,2015-11-16,32458496,Cindy,"It's hard to do justice to this lovely studio, and Jim could not have been more gracious and welcoming. The location is ideal -- perfect for leisurely walks through Beacon Hill, along Charles Street, and in the Boston Common, as well as quick trips to the subway or Whole Foods/CVS. Yet, despite its central location, the studio is tucked away from the hustle and bustle. We were also grateful for the rare parking spot and the ease with which we could access a variety of freeways. After a day of exploring, it was a delight to enter the charming courtyard and relax in the studio that maximizes comfort, convenience and visual appeal. This studio was, in fact, the primary factor in making our visit memorable in every respect. Thanks, Jim, for your many successful efforts to make us feel at home!"

It is so cozy to go back to at the end of an eventful day in the Boston area and relax. Jim himself is such a gracious host, he checked in on throughout the stay to ensure everything was perfect.

This property was represented accurately however, it is difficult to describe all the charming qualities of this studio apartment in a brief listing.

The linens were fresh and clean, the bed so comfortable.  There is a delightful patio area inside the gate that was a lovely spot for morning coffee. Jim gave clear instructions on how to access the keys and get into the apartment which was so helpful for us as this was our first trip to Boston. This was within walking distance to much of our itinerary, including Boston Common, The Public Gardens, The Freedom Trail, The Esplanade, and great dining.

This place had what we needed for our short stay in Boston. This is a basement flat so the ceiling's are quiet low so my 6'2 partner had minor inconveniences at times. The flat could be quiet dark during the day due to having only the one window at the front of the flat. However,the outside seating space provides great space to soak up the natural light. This is a lovely,quaint little place in a very beautiful part of this fantastic city.,,,

And Robert was very sweet, he told us where we can park our car and how to get in the house. Every time when I asked him something, he always replied me in time. All my friends said they had a sweet dream and a good sleep in this place. But because there are only 3 full-size beds, I think it's a little bit crowded for 7 people. And we had to queue up for bathroom (because there is only one.) Anyway, love this place and good experience!"

7713728,50461314,2015-10-12,42076519,Zenaida,"The place was AMAZING! My first time using airbnb and I was extremely pleased with everything. My family enjoyed their stay and first time in Boston and Robert was very helpful and the communication was great! The location was comfortable, minutes away from the city, and blocks away from the beach."
7713728,50644213,2015-10-13,1222974,Catalina,"My family and I (6 people total) stayed at Robert’s apartment for one night. The apartment is clean, beautifully furnished, and a good size for three couples. The only issue we had was with parking: we assumed we’d be able to find a parking lot nearby for overnight parking and we couldn’t so we ended up having it to leave it a drive away and Uber back. That is definitely not on Robert, since the listing indicates no parking on premises, but just a warning for anyone driving. Overall, a great apartment that I would recommend."
7713728,51024125,2015-10-17,23896507,June,"离机场很近,离市区稍远,但是可以接受,房子干净整洁,空间宽敞,非常适合家庭居住。会推荐给朋友。"

7713728,51544491,2015-10-21,15160840,Marie,We had a great time in Roberts's appartement: it is very clean and confortable and very well decorated.
Robert's guide was precious to help us finding good addresses to eat. And he made sure to be available in case we needed him to.,,,,,
In short,"the whole family loved it!\"",,,,

7713728,52576565,2015-10-31,40986421,Andrew,"Clean spacious apartment, as pictured. Great for 3 couples. In a nice quiet neighborhood, a short walk to the water. Bob was a great host, checking in frequently by text to make sure everything was perfect. I would highly recommend, and would stay here again. Parking is difficult here, but the city and airport are easily accessible without a car."
7713728,52850415,2015-11-02,44767589,Cassie,"Robert was very attentive throughout our entire stay and checked in with us frequently to see if we needed anything. Before we arrived, he sent a thorough note detailing how to check in, parking options and wifi information, which was much appreciated! The apartment is very cute, clean and perfect for six people. Would definitely recommend, thanks Robert!"
7713728,53201533,2015-11-06,20221491,Steffen,"Beautiful place, amazing stay! Apartment is wonderful, neighborhood nice and the host is super friendly and always responds within minutes. Fantastic!"
7713728,53485071,2015-11-09,45524696,Kim,"Our rental experience with Robert was excellent.  He made us feel very welcome, was in contact to make sure we got in Ok and that everything was to our expectations. The apartment was very inviting and had everything we needed- loved the back porch. It is located in a great neighborhood , only blocks form the beach and we found a restaurant bar within walking distance that had great food and craft beers.  We look forward to renting again in the future."
7713728,53766420,2015-11-12,36458780,Patrick,"Really nice place, worked out perfectly. This was one of the nicer AirBNB's I've stayed at in this price range. Robert was also very professional and the entire process was a breeze."
7713728,54099439,2015-11-16,42690744,Leandro,My friends and I had an amazing time in Boston . We loved the area thought it was very nice. The house was perfect . We had perfect space for my friends and I .
7713728,54613228,2015-11-22,47278675,Patricia,"We thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to Boston, thanks in large part to Robert's great apartment. It was very clean, spacious and comfortable for the five of us. Upon arriving, I immediately unpacked our suitcases and had plenty of space to put everything away. We enjoyed walking to nearby stores and restaurants and to the beach, and we Ubered into town a couple of times (and even bravely drove into town once). The entire stay was a great success. Our only difficulty was parking, which Robert graciously helped us to navigate. (We managed well with the parking until the last night, when due to our misunderstanding the rules, we received a $40 parking ticket.) I highly recommend Robert's place and would definitely stay there again."
7713728,54846820,2015-11-25,7118608,Adrienne,"I came to visit Boston with a group of 8 others and we loved our stay in this cozy apartment! It was a very tight squeeze for such a large group, but Robert was kind enough to accommodate some of our last minute stragglers. The apartment was as beautiful as advertised with each room well-decorated and exceptionally clean. The location was a bit of a distance from the main city and from public transit, but was very close to the water. We ended up using lyft/uber to get into the city and walk, which wasn't very expensive at all. The neighborhood was quiet, and we were able to eat at some charming family-owned restaurants, thanks to Robert's suggestion."
Unfortunately,we didn't get a chance to meet Robert,"but he kept in contact with us the entire time and was very hospitable! I would definitely recommend this place to others (but certainly with less people than we tried to fit!). \"",,,
7713728,55723324,2015-12-05,17965108,Beth,"Robert's apartment is spacious, as beautifully decorated as the photos suggest, and conveniently located to boot.  We had a great time staying here and walking back and forth to our event at the BCEC.  Robert was great with communication, very reachable by text or phone, and was welcoming and gracious.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone, and we hope to stay here again."
7713728,56483287,2015-12-14,45678615,Margaret,Robert was great at welcoming us and attended very rapidly to any concerns we had about the flat. It was a really nice quiet neighborhood.  We were able to take UBER to most destinations such as the aquarium and art gallery for 10 to $14.  The kitchen was well equipped which we were thankful for as we liked to eat in at least one meal a day. The house was clean and sufficient space for 4 of us.
7713728,56749002,2015-12-17,39106647,Paul,We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay in Southie at Robert's pad. We had everything we needed in our very clean nicely decorated 3 bedroom 2nd floor apartment. We enjoyed meeting Robert whom coincidentally had gone to high school on our fair island. There are a couple of nice gastro- pubs in the neighborhood. We were here on business and the location was very convenient to Logan. Fortunately we took Roberts sage advice and only got our car rental on the one day we needed. Parking throughout Southie is a challenge. Overall a nice bargain would definitely stay again. Thanks!
7713728,57056835,2015-12-21,48205790,Yuxuan,The house is really great! We enjoy a great time!
7713728,57263975,2015-12-23,25982723,Yunfu,This is one of the best places among my Airbnb experiences. Great location near the coast and quiet neighborhood. My family had a good time.
7713728,57372529,2015-12-25,14970759,Minh,"The house was very warm and cozy. We stayed only for one day but had a very pleasant stay. Good location, near the beach and doesn't affected by the noisiness of the city. Very convenient to drive to city centre, make it a great flat to stay in Boston."
7713728,58079906,2015-12-31,31595368,Erika,"Robert did a great job, of staying in touch.  My family arrived earlier than me, he greeted them, and informed them of his availability to answer any questions.  The apartment was adorable.  Perfect for our purposes.  We did not check out the neighborhood.  But easily got to the Seaport area in 5 minutes, with an Uber cab.  Robert was flexible with us staying until noon the next day.  All in all a great experience, for a night out on the town in Boston, with the whole family."
7713728,58270855,2016-01-02,29736182,Michael,"We had a great stay in this beautiful apartment. It was clean, tastefully decorated, and well-supplied with all we needed. We appreciated the location, very close to the ocean yet not too far from downtown. Good place to spend New Years Eve."
7713728,58866463,2016-01-05,48438837,Sheng,Robert's house is well decorated and locates in a peaceful community. It was perfect in total. Subway is not so nearby and we use taxi. Robert is helpful and friendly. My friends enjoy staying this house! I highly recommond this house!
7713728,59296913,2016-01-09,34789353,Nattacha,"The apartment was clean, nicely decorate and located in good location. Communication with Robert was great, he reply very quickly. My family really enjoyed staying at Robert's place!"
7713728,59518407,2016-01-11,29264206,Alycia,"My family and I met in Boston for our belated holiday celebration this year and stayed at Robert's place on a Saturday night.  Robert was excellent at communicating, and finding the place and checking in a little early was not a problem.  Parking was a little tricky, as it always is in Boston, especially with two cars, because most of the parking spots are for residents.   The apartment itself is very nicely decorated (think beach cottage on the Cape), clean, comfortable, and was plenty spacious enough for five adults and a child.  Our patriarch has some mobility problems, but the stairs to the apartment are not overly steep and there is a railing, so it was fine for him.  The only real downside to our stay was that it was a Saturday night, and the upstairs neighbors were relatively loud until the early morning hours, which made sleeping difficult for those of us who are lighter sleepers.  However, Robert said that he would speak to them, so hopefully that will no longer be an issue.  Overall, we had a good stay and Robert was very responsive to our needs.  This place would be especially great for a young-ish group that wants to explore the city during the days and nights, as all of Boston is easily accessible from that location."
7713728,60332167,2016-01-22,21088157,Paul,Yes all arrangements went smoothly and Robert was very attentive
7713728,60597334,2016-01-25,10247773,Séamus,Had a terrific experience and really appreciate the way you handled the key situation. Thank you!

Robert was very accommodating with the handing over of keys and kept in touch frequently to see if there was anything we needed. All in all, it was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again."
7713728,63461615,2016-02-23,24459012,Alena,This weekend couldn't have gone any better. The house was absolutely perfect. Southie is a beautiful neighborhood. Couldn't speak more highly of Robert..he was very friendly helpful and available to answer all our questions. Would recommend this place 110% :)
7713728,63779611,2016-02-27,49581449,Havi,"Robert was great right from the moment I decided to book his place. He was prompt with his messages and gave plenty of information about the surrounding areas! His place was beautiful and comfortable, we really enjoyed our stay here! Thank you Robert!"
7713728,64043224,2016-02-29,49493205,Alexandra,Our stay was perfect! The apartment is lovely and was exactly what I had expected based on description and photos.  Bob is a great host and was very willing to help in anyway he could. The apartment was in a great location and had everything we needed.

7713728,68502048,2016-04-05,55583865,Sarah,"Robert was very nice and accommodating as he was right down stairs! The apartment was clean and exactly as advertised! Only down side was the lack of available parking, but fairly understandable due to location."
7713728,69884645,2016-04-14,4155484,Claudette,"We had a wonderful stay in Robert's apt.  It was clean and beautiful and we actually looked forward to spending our evening relaxing after a long day touring Boston. Robert responded immediately to any question I posted.  The Southie neighborhood was quiet and charming. As a traveler, I like to stay in the middle of the action and that was the one personal drawback for me.  However, it was a quick Uber ride to where I needed to be."
7713728,70587527,2016-04-18,55835730,Jill,"Had a wonderful family vacation celebrating a 30th birthday. Beautiful décor, clean and inviting home. Cozy while spacious. Robert was a great host who was always available as needed without being too on top of us. Highly recommend."
7713728,71423839,2016-04-25,6281927,Nicole,"Robert was a wonderful host, and his space was perfect for our group! Safety for members of our group who identify as LGBTQ was a huge concern with trying AirBnb for the first time, and he was perfectly comfortable with assuaging our concerns. The location is great, there's a lot of wonderful little touches (like power strips!) that made it that much easier to be away from home. I'm already looking for an excuse to go back!"
7713728,71744549,2016-04-28,17635678,Jonathan,"An AirBnB where the reality is far better than the photographs! Great neighbourhood, and really easy to get into Boston itself. Apartment is beautiful and so well appointed, and Robert is a very thoughtful and gracious host, who helped us in any way he could. Parking is easy if you go to the East of the yacht club where there are no restrictions, and Local 149 is well worth a visit."
"A great vacation place - well worth a visit!\"",,,,,

The place is extremely clean, cozy, nicely decorated, and well-equipped."
Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Robert in person,but he was constantly in touch and sent us all the information we needed in advance.,,,,

Just take your car and park in a city public garage. Apartment was a little noicy due to wooden floors.  Overall value for money."
7713728,88198188,2016-07-23,8197221,Sally,"Robert gave us clear instructions about arrival and the appt was spotless, and nice and cool when we arrived during a heatwave!

"It was close to the T - orange line. Only short 1.5 mile to Longview medical hub - we walked but can also be accessed with the MTBA public transportation. The public transportation that Boston has available makes everything affordably nearby. We easily grabbed the T right from the airport to the house. The neighborhood was quiet. Cappys Pizza was delicious. The hosts are very considerate. \"",,,,,

11656698,71200923,2016-04-24,22295625,Nicholas,"Adriana & Gianni were very helpful in getting us settled in, and the place was great – nice access to Jamaica Plain, clean (basically all new inside) and cozy, and spacious. About a 10-15 minute cab ride to downtown Boston, with good T access as well."
11656698,72098798,2016-05-01,5097639,Sherri & Eric,We had a wonderful time. The location was perfect for a home base to explore the city. We spent two days here and loved it.

11656698,73750650,2016-05-09,32667309,Wooje,The three of us had a good time in Adriana & Gianni's house. It is in a quite area but very close to a T (Boston Metro) station and a bus stop. A supermarket (Stop and shop) and liquor stores are within walking distance. The house is new and clean. The shower had very strong water pressure.
Adriana and Gianni kindly accommodated our early arrival and late departure.,,,,,

The apt was exactly as described and featured on the pictures. very C-L-E-A-N and updated apt. Location was not far from a grocery store, liquor store, or train stop. We made breakfast each morning before starting our day. Dish washer was handy."
11656698,76112558,2016-05-24,5212542,Tricia,"Adriana greeted us with a warm welcome, showing us their lovely home and answering any questions. She was very attentive to any concerns we had during our stay."
Their place is represented well on the listing. It is spotless,light and airy.,,,,
"The T is a short walk and the park across the street is a great place for families with children. \"",,,,,
11656698,76325071,2016-05-26,25951069,George,Adriana and Gianni were excellent hosts! They were extremely welcoming and accommodating to our arrival time. They gave great advice on the area and how to get around.

"I would definitely stay with Adriana and Gianni again!\"",,,,,
11656698,77466172,2016-06-01,44915736,Bikash,"Stayed two nights.  Very clean and minimalistic as shown in the pictures.  Just perfect for our needs.  We would definitely stay again.  Parked car in front of the house; had no issues.  Host's very nice!  They live next door.  Orange line/Jackson Square station is less then 5 mins walk.  Very convenient to connect to other trains.  However, it seemed to be bit deserted for a night time commute.  Therefore, we used Uber at night."
11656698,77687431,2016-06-02,58786064,Theresa,I stayed at Adriana's and Gianni's place with my parents and we had an awesome time. The apartment offers everything you need and looks newly renovated. Adriana and Gianni even allowed us to drop off our luggage early because we had to drop off our rental car before check-in. They were very welcoming and great hosts. Thank you very much for everything and all the best for you.
11656698,78003515,2016-06-05,70967449,Noor Eddin,Adriana and Gianni were very welcoming. They went out of their way to make us comfortable. They met us ahead of checkin time and took our luggage and stored it for us after checkout.
"They were incredibly nice and friendly and felt very welcoming. The neighborhood was very nice. It was next to a lovely park. The T-station was a five minutes walk away as well as a grocery shop and a few restaurants and cafes. \"",,,,,
11656698,79604984,2016-06-13,71678551,Afton,Beautiful apartment that was comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay. The area was accessible to the city attractions and seemed very safe and in a good neighborhood. The hosts were welcoming and we had a great stay.
11656698,80063208,2016-06-16,62170206,Weronika,"The place is very clean and spacious. Plenty of room to store your clothes. Very convenient location, minutes from  subway station."
"\"",,,,,
11656698,80810594,2016-06-19,60638033,Caroline,"We had a wonderful experience at Adriana and Gianni's apartment!  It was exactly as it was shown on the profile--everything was renovated and nice and clean.  It was nicely stocked for 4 people.  Gianni greeted us and even helped us find on-street parking (we arrived at rush hour, so it was a little crazy for us).  He offered helpful advice about Boston and checked in with us periodically throughout our stay.  They live next door, which is helpful, but not overwhelming.  The T stop really is a short 5 minute walk and the grocery store is nearby as well.   The park across the street is being upgraded--really cool playground equipment and basketball courts.  We hope to come back soon."
11656698,82808882,2016-06-29,65002090,Keyhee,It was very comfortable staying. I stayed there with three aunts and they all loved this house. It was a little bit hard to climb stairs but everything was neat and clean. Gianni was very welcoming. Kitchen was clean and utensils were nice so we could cook a lot. Even pot was coated brightly. I recommend you to stay here if you like neat and nice house for good price. :) It is very close to the station so anyone can walked to the house. There are big supermarket and liquor shop near house.
11656698,83242867,2016-07-02,27294927,Niloy,"Gianni met us when we came, and he was very welcoming.  Made the check in process very easy.  The place was close to a T stop and allowed us easy access to the city.  The listing was exactly as in pictures, and was clean overall.  However, the neighborhood was a bit loud, with many sirens at night. Otherwise, would recommend this place for future people when they come to Boston!"
11656698,83629179,2016-07-03,13078324,Lauren,Adriana and Gianni's apartment was perfect for our first time to Boston! They were extremely welcoming and accommodating and let us drop our bags before we checked in. The apartment was spotless and have everything we needed. It was conveniently located minutes away from a subway station which made commuting a breeze!
11656698,84318243,2016-07-06,12073514,Olivia,"We were made welcome and given advice on where to buy food etc. The apartment was clean and spacious and there were basics like coffee and oil provided. Being July, we found the upstairs living space a bit warm, but the bedrooms were cooler. The journey into downtown Boston was an easy ten minute walk then about twenty minutes on the T. We were lucky to be there on 4th July and saw the amazing fireworks."
11656698,84678408,2016-07-08,19616137,Ahmed,"\"It was a great experience spending 2 nights at Gianni's appartement. Very clean, very spacious, and close to everything. I could easily reach the house and park my rental car in front of it. The orange line is just 5 min walking from the house. There is also a big grocery store \"\"Stop and shop\"\" close to the house \"\"12 min. walking or so.\"\" Gianni was easy to reach per phone and he or one of his family were available when we needed him. They were all generous and helpful. Gianni offered me a place to put my luggagage while we further explore Boston in our last day. I really appreciate that. In general"
"Thanks Gianni and hope to come to your house again\"",,,,,
11656698,86041684,2016-07-14,2410945,Pierre-Philippe,we arrived at the flat with Andrea waiting for us in the street.  He gave me a hand to park the car a few meters/yards from the flat. We then left the car at this spot for free which was convenient as we only needed it three days later to drive to NYC. The street provides free parking.
The flat is a few minutes walk from Jackson Square station on the Orange line subway. This is a very good line to access central Boston.,,,,,
There is also a supermarket one block further down the subway line which is good to buy food at lower price and with more choice than at a corner shop. There is also a corner shop just one minute from the flat which is good if you forgot something or you need to shop a bit late (but of course with limited choice).,,,,,
The flat itself is in good order,it was probably redone recently,so it feels new and fine. Everything is clean too. The living space is large,and the rooms are adequately sized. The beds are good. The street is quiet so we had good sleeps.,,
The WiFi could be better as it is a bit slow and not perfectly reachable in the entire flay. You can use however the WiFi from the other flat to get a better coverage when the first Wi-Fi is reluctant to connect.,,,,,
No air con but there are fans. The weather was hot but with the fans it was OK.,,,,,
"This was a good stay and we would use it again to visit Boston. We were two adults and two teenagers.\"",,,,,

11656698,87330277,2016-07-19,11715422,Jasmine,"The house was very lovely and exactly like how they described on the page and in the photos. It was very clean and neat. I rented this apartment for my family to stay when they came to Boston to visit me. They thought the beds were comfy. However, one thing that really bothered my aunt was the LACK OF AIR CONDITIONING. It was my fault for not checking the house properly. Gianni was very nice to give my aunt extra fan but it didn't really help. The house's architecture doesn't allow the air to flow so it was somewhat humid and hot during the day. My family and I were outside a lot so we didn't get a chance to meet and talk  much with Gianni and his wife. Gianni was very nice to swing by to say hi and check in on us!"

11656698,87732151,2016-07-21,66019181,Neil,Gianni was there to meet us when we arrived and to show us the property and answer any questions. He was available during our stay to help if we needed it.
The property is very bright,neat and well presented. It's easy to get into town via the T line which is a 5 mins walk away.,,,,
It was useful that we could park our hire car directly in front of the property.,,,,,
"We enjoyed our stay and time exploring Boston.\"",,,,,
11656698,88882901,2016-07-25,20291804,Laura,Very easy check in process and short walk to the T. Also very easy to get an Uber if we didn't feel like using public transportation. Apartment is clean and also had easy check out process.
11656698,89299687,2016-07-27,62116761,Megan,Great clean place! I must have overlooked that it didn't have a/c so it made for a warm sleep in July but that's my fault as it was mentioned in the listing. Cheap Uber ($15 max) to anywhere downtown.
11656698,89756284,2016-07-29,65152647,Rachel,Good price and the house is close to metro station. It would be better if it is equipped with washer machine and air conditioner.
11656698,91496028,2016-08-05,7640254,Johanna,The apartment was real nice. I would say even better than in pictures. Morning sun wakes you up in the combined dining and living room upstairs.
We did not meet A&G but communication worked well.,,,,,
We rented bicicles and recommend that as a means of exploring Boston. The listing has a good place for storaging bikes in the back of the house.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
11656698,93209245,2016-08-11,47443454,Mike,"The house is great - with a really modern and well stocked kitchen, great lounge and bedrooms. As we were there in August it was very warm, and we didn't pick up on the lack of AirCon in the advert (totally our fault). There were fans provided in each of the rooms which helped for sure - but without air con it is warm. The location is really convenient to a market and the T station, and felt really safe walking all times of day."
11656698,94021032,2016-08-14,14553937,Luca,Gianni ci ha accolti al ma.arrivo .
L'appartamento è nuovissimo ed i ottime condizioni .,,,,,
Manca ancora l'aria condizionata che in estate può essere un problema.,,,,,
La disponibilità e la cortesia di Gianni ed Adriana sono fantastiche.,,,,,
A poca distanza dalla stazione di Jackson Square della Orange Line con cui in 15 minuti si è in downtown/North End.,,,,,
"Il quartiere è tranquillo con ampia disponibilità per panini/pizze ect.\"",,,,,
11656698,94769174,2016-08-16,46831002,Jérôme,A great flat to visit Boston.
It was a super experience.,,,,,
The first floor with the both bedrooms and the second with kitchen and living room were very large and we like it.,,,,,
A good adress to stay and be back.,,,,,
"Thanks Adriana and Gianni\"",,,,,
11656698,95469744,2016-08-19,4787362,Nicola,"L'accoglienza dell'Host è stata cordiale e puntuale, disponibile a spostare la sua auto per fare spazio alla mia, pronto ad accogliere ogni richiesta."
Il quartiere è periferico e di primo acchito non fa una bella impressione; non abbiamo però avuto alcun problema e la metropolitana è distante 10 minuti a piedi.,,,,,
L'appartamento è proprio come risulta dalle foto. Comodo,"grande e pulito \"",,,,
14774426,99352903,2016-09-04,8727575,Blair,Xianxin was a great host. The place was clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable. Short walk to the T. I would stay here again.
7113260,38081544,2015-07-12,14440367,Bridget,Daniel was superb!! He was extremely friendly and hospitable. He offered restaurant ideas and even let us borrow his Hubway to use a bike for the day. The place was extremely clean and ideal location for what we were looking to do.
7113260,41123128,2015-08-04,1768722,Sebastiano,"Daniel was very kind from the beginning and always available to provide useful informations. The loft is awesome and it's 5 mins walking from the tube, absolutely perfect for who's visiting Boston. Absolutely recommended to everyone!"
7113260,42494963,2015-08-13,6203733,Maxime,"Awesome and beautiful condo near Boston downtown. It's in a LEED Platinum building, that's just awesome, it's beautiful inside-out and it's a corner appartment, so plenty of windows in here."
His roommate is super friendly and helped us out to find places to go out and Daniel even met us when we were eating downtown to make sure everything was alright.,,,,,
"A+++ experience here!\"",,,,,
7113260,43328231,2015-08-18,32862740,Kelsey,"Daniel was a great host, we only stayed a day but he communicated very well to coordinate the arrival. The room was clean and spacious, located just 10 minutes from Fenway. We would recommend staying with Daniel."

7113260,46031370,2015-09-07,21986086,Elle,Great place for stay. Good location which is close to orange line and only 10mins drive to downtown. Daniel was very kind and active to reply my question when I had trouble with entering the home. Definitely recommend.
7113260,46424743,2015-09-10,6423333,Lindsay,"Daniel is a generous and helpful host who really made me feel at home in his beautiful apartment! I was in Boston for a short three days and the space was absolutely perfect for my needs. It was a quick car ride to the conference I was attending, and the surrounding neighborhood itself was cute and fun to walk around in. Daniel had great recommendations for bars and restaurants in the nearby area as well as closer to downtown and the convention center where I spent most of my time. It was a clean, beautiful, easy-to-access apartment. What more do you need? I would return in a heartbeat."
7113260,47875993,2015-09-21,2241535,Wilson,"Daniel's place is in a wonderful loft building a short walk away from the Orange Line. Everything was clean, no major complains."
Although I never got to meet Daniel in person,when we had a mix up with the key exchange (100% my fault),he was so kind as to go out of his way,first rush back to his place,and then come back downtown to drop off keys where I was working that day.,
"Would recommend.\"",,,,,
7113260,48527951,2015-09-27,21749523,Anne-Marie,"Nice loft! Easy to find. We didn't realize it was next to the railways, quite noisy at night. Daniel answered us very quickly for all our requests. Subway is near, so we reached dowtown easily."
7113260,50373596,2015-10-11,9427146,Marilou,I had a great experience staying at Daniel's apartment with my mother.
The room was perfectly clean,the mattress comfortable,we had 2 great nights of sleep!,,,
The apartment is BIG (I live in NYC so any apartment bigger than mine feels huge!!),the bathroom is spacious.,,,,
The location is good,a short and nice walk to the Roxbury-Crossing T station.,,,,
Daniel let us the address of his favorite coffee shop and we weren't disappointed! Best coffee ever.,,,,,
I would definitely recommend Daniel's place and I would come back.,,,,,

7113260,70740956,2016-04-20,39913291,Barry,"Thanks Daniel he was very accommodating.  He was extremely communicative and always was very helpful.  He had coffee waiting for me, are you kidding me?? He also offered me his hospitality and things if I needed them.  Additionally, the place was great and close to the T train.  The place was excellent and I appreciated the washer and dryer. There was nothing I could complain about except I wish I could stay another week.   I felt safe in the building and the residents were very friendly. Thanks for having me stay for the Boston Marathon!"
7113260,75569880,2016-05-22,71896976,Stephen,"Daniel was an excellent host. I met him as scheduled to get my key and everything was smooth with no problems. The place was wonderful and accurately described. It was very clean, with a comfortable bed, and conveniently located to the T station which was about a five minute walk for me.  Although the train can easily be heard from the room, it did not bother me in any way. I thoroughly enjoyed my short stay in Boston and would absolutely stay here again."

The photos of the accommodation is exactly what we saw, the bed was really comfy! - that we slept in a bit too much. Location was perfect! Not too far of a walking distance to Jackson Square T-Metro-Sub. Daniel was a wonderful host! - in guiding us what attractions to see, how to get around, it was very helpful. And he's very easy-going and down to earth! We really enjoyed our first-time stay in Boston!!"

Plenty of parking,great location. Check out Bay Sweets the Lebanese bakery and grocery just a mile up Center Street for some delicious house staples!,,,,

The pad was in this beautiful old Boston home with high ceilings and thee most comfortable beds and comfortable living space, nice back yard for drinking morning coffee and clean, well kept house overall. It's also close to the bus and T ( commuter train) lines. As well as small, quaint shops to explore in West Roxbury if you wanted an outing close to home without facing the big city. It's safe and John was very solicitous throughout the whole booking process. I'd definitely recommend."

John's home is clean,spacious,minimalist ...perfect accommodations for our week in Boston as we tried hard to balance work and play. Parking was always readily available no matter the hour of our return and John was thorough,thoughtful and immediate with all communication. Friendly neighbors across the street,too...would recommend this space for executive family travel,too
9292118,69463639,2016-04-11,28022428,Erin,"Great stay! Appreciated the thorough instructions regarding everything we would need to know regarding locks, garbage, parking, etc. - made it easy and convenient. Spacious rooms and good places for takeout nearby, worked well for our quick weekend in town."
9292118,70696682,2016-04-19,47274562,Kurt,"John's place was very clean and comfortable. The beds were comfortable, WiFi and cable worked fine. Really we had no troubles. There is a supermarket around the corner and the train station nearby which was very convenient. John was a great host, even from across the country."
9292118,71123623,2016-04-23,273730,Arthur,John was a great host and the place was wonderful. An easy commute to downtown Boston and had some good food spots near by. I highly recommend John's place for anyone looking to visit Boston.
9292118,71571219,2016-04-26,18660598,Mary,"John's place was the perfect spot for us. It was clean, comfortable, well equipped and spacious. The keypad code for entering and locking the apartment was very convenient. The neighborhood was quiet and parking on the street was plentiful. The restaurants and stores that are within walking distance added to the charm of staying at this location."
"We hope to take advantage of this location the next time we are visiting the area.\"",,,,,
9292118,72564615,2016-05-03,17654703,Joan,"The apartment was just exactly what we had hoped - well appointed and very spacious.  The location is great, quiet but close to everything. We could walk to shops and restaurants. Parking on the street was never a problem. The commuter train station is a short walk away for trips to/from Boston.  As we have family living in West Roxbury, we plan to return to the apartment often as it makes a perfect base for us when visiting West Roxbury."
9292118,74978611,2016-05-17,40698176,Ludovic,"Notre séjour s'est très bien déroulé! Merci pour tout John, c'était parfait... Tu as été de très bons conseils."
9292118,75481917,2016-05-21,25005576,Hua,My family and I had a pleasant stay at John's place. The check-in went smoothly. The rooms were clean and the dinning area was very big. We didn't use the commuter rail but the train station was really close to the house. There is also a big Star Market within a few blocks to do grocery shopping. The neighborhood was very quiet and seemed pretty safe. Parking was not a problem either. The only thing is that the Wifi wasn't working well during our stay. Overall I would definitely recommend this place!
9292118,78958161,2016-06-10,26795062,Gigi,"We love how the host was always very prompt in responding to our emails and requests. Apartment was very spacious for our family of 4 and it had a very homey feel. Everything went smooth with our stay. Kitchen had all the basic supplies we needed for our stay. Beds and pillows are super soft and comfortable! The property was also in a very quiet and safe neghborhood but walking distance to a lot of restaurants, groceries etc. Within easy reach to downtown Boston and to all major attractions. Our family will definitely stay here again. Highly recommended to everyone. Thank you John and to your brother. We had an awesome time in Boston:-)"
9292118,80735539,2016-06-19,43809562,Francisco,"La casa está en perfectas condiciones y pueden alojarse mínimo 4 personas con gran comodidad. Está a una distancia intermedia del centro de Boston (30 minutos) pero el barrio es muy pintoresco y tranquilo en contacto con la naturaleza ya que incluso hemos visto conejos y ardillas en el jardín de la casa.Se puede estacionar en la puerta sin pagar; tiene un supermercado muy grande a solo 300 mts. Todo preparado para tener una hermosa visita en Boston. En anfitrión muy correcto, cumpliendo con todo lo anunciado."

7134081,39080983,2015-07-20,10736656,Margo,Casey's listing was exactly as pictured. Amazing views of Boston and the harbor from the 17th floor and plenty of amenities. He was very responsive and went above and beyond for my special birthday celebrations. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a luxurious Seaport/Innovation district space.

7134081,42557661,2015-08-14,7417697,Oren,"I stayed at Casey's apartment for 19 wonderful days together with a business partner. The apartment is spacious, the beds we're very comfortable, the bathrooms, kitchen, living room, air condition, washer & dryer, the view - were just perfect. The building is very comfortable and safe, 10 minutes walk to the red line subway, many restaurants and cafes around, gym and lounge in the building."
Casey himself was always available online,was helpful with anything we needed from apartment questions to things to do in the weekend.,,,,
Overall - it was a perfect Airbnb experience,I highly recommend this listing to anyone looking for a spacious,safe,"comfortable place in Boston.\"",,
7134081,45690550,2015-09-05,2866757,Borja,Great place to stay in Boston.
Very nice and confortable apartment in a new building with good amenities (gym,lounge...); even nicer than in the pictures and with a great view.,,,,
Nice area with restaurants and bars within walking distance; few minutes to metro and to South Station,plenty of cabs and a short ride from the airport.  Also nice walk to Boston city center or main attractions -no more than 20 min-.,,,,
Very good host,communicative and helpful to ensure a great stay in Boston.,,,,

7134081,49908739,2015-10-07,2728109,Mary,"I stayed at Casey's while in town for work. Super convenient to the convention center, but also easy to access the rest of Boston. Casy's apartment was very clean, he was super easy to communicate with, and overall it was a great stay. Highly recommended!"
7134081,50503692,2015-10-12,44069623,Molly,"Gorgeous apartment. Sunny, great views, spacious. Casey was great and coordinated everything seamlessly. Thanks for a great visit."
7134081,50812109,2015-10-14,2206695,Jan-Christoph,I was nicely welcomed by a friend of the host who explained the details of this beautifully appointed building and place. A terrific sundown and sunrise was followed by a fog the next day. The area is up and coming with an easy walk to South Station or Downtown. Great restaurants are nearby.
7134081,50974417,2015-10-16,23191612,Raymond,"Loved it!  Unit had beautiful views, was comfortable, and was perfect for my needs.  Great location - short trek from airport, and great eateries nearby.  Building was modern, clean, and well maintained.  Excellent facilities - rooftop lounge and deck was fantastic.  We enjoyed a few adult beverages by the outdoor fire, with the skyline and sunset framing the picture.  Thanks for a great stay!"
7134081,71388804,2016-04-25,49372605,Joseph,"The building and unit was great. Host made it very accommodating to my needs. Unit is as described and very comfortable, felt like being home. If you need to go to any conventions at the seaport, BCEC, or just a weekend in Boston I would really suggest this place."
7134081,92400083,2016-08-08,55649919,Rochelle,"This condo exceeded all of my expectations in every way.  It was much larger than I expected, modern, very clean, decorated beautifully and just an overall lovely place.  Both beds were so comfortable, it was hard for us to get up and go to the trade show that we were attending!  From the time that I made the reservation, until the time that I checked out of the condo, Casey was extremely attentive and helpful with all aspects of our stay.  He was always available by phone, and was just a really nice person.  I was in Boston for a Trade Show at the Boston Convention Center, THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE IF YOU ARE ATTENDING ANY EVENTS AT THE CONVENTION CENTER! But, if you are coming to Boston for another reason, it is only a short cab ride to go anywhere else in the city.  We walked to a different place for dinner every night, as the neighborhood has a ton of fantastic walkable restaurants and cafe's.  All within a five minute walk.  There is also a market just a few steps around the corner.  There is a spectacular rooftop recreation room, with a huge outside deck area to lounge with a glass of wine after a long day...which we made use of. There is also a postcard perfect view of the city skyline from the rooftop deck.  The one negative part of the experience for us was when it was time to go home (which is weird because we were in Boston for work!).  I would recommend this property to even the pickiest of travelers. I will be back for sure!  Thanks Casey!"

Thank you good place for summer because we have aces to the clim."
7095320,94380528,2016-08-15,23371840,Ellen,"My sister and I stayed here 4 nights in August. The best part of this air bnb is the location.  It is within walking distance to multiple cafes, bars, and restaurants. You can also easily get to any touristy thing by bike share or a quick uber ride. That was the saving grace of this air bnb."
I have been staying in Air Bnbs for quite some time all over the world and this was the most disappointing. We arrived later in the afternoon so we got in and threw our stuff down then left for a sunset cruise (highly recommend). At first glance,the place seemed to be okay. We did notice right away that the apartment did not have central AC but had two window units. The second bedroom DOES NOT have a window unit. So,when it's the middle of August,the hottest weekend of the year,and you are on the top floor it was pretty miserable to sleep in. There were two fans but they basically pushed warm air around the room.,
In the first bedroom,the bed was on the floor. There was a mouse trap right next to the bed along with hangers. It was clearly obvious that the room had been straightened up but not cleaned. The sheets appeared dirty and there was only the bottom sheet. The top sheet had been taken off and shoved in the closest.,,,,
The bathroom in the photo looks like it is very nice. The bathroom actually had mildew and mold on the sink. The shower curtain and the liner also were moldy.  The bath tub had mildew as well. We were also only left two towels for two people for essentially 5 days.,,,,,
Tommy was very quick to respond with our concerns. He was willing to help. However,we ended up buying new sheets which after speaking to Airbnb they refunded us the money for them. Airbnb also returned the cleaning fee after submitting pictures.,,,,
We were able to leave late which was nice.,,,,,

3870046,18388590,2014-08-25,819745,Alexander,"We stayed at Brian's and Lisa' apartment for two nights and had a fantastic time. We rented the apartment only one day in advance while they were still on vacation. They responded quickly to every message and were very friendly and helpful, so everything went smoothly. Their apartment is truly awesome: it is spacious, bright, calm and has a lot of character. It's located in a beautiful old Victorian house in Back Bay, one of the most beautiful and convenient areas of the city. A great home away from home. Highly recommend."
3870046,19537657,2014-09-14,5556134,George,We had a blast staying at Brian and Lisa's place. Brian was super communicative and personable. We arrived about 30mins early and Brian was great about meeting us ahead of time. Perfect location for access to the city. Great spot to start a run. Quiet and safe neighborhood. Apartment was great. Bed super comfortable and great light and breeze from the windows. Bathroom was a great size and no issue w hot water or pressure. Couch was awesome for watching TV. We loved it and look forward to coming back soon.
3870046,19896156,2014-09-20,8521334,Heather,"Brian and Lisa were excellent hosts! They were very communicative leading up to my trip and provided helpful tips about parking, etc. Brian was flexible with my arrival time (which shifted by about an hour due to traffic) despite the fact that it was a work day which was much appreciated. He met me at the apartment in a timely fashion and was very friendly and helpful (he carried my bag up the 3 flights of stairs!)."
The apartment is in a lovely,safe,centrally located neighborhood steps away from Newbury Street and Copley Square. It is easy to walk to many sights and public transportation is very accessible from this location. The only downside is that parking is tricky around here,so I would recommend leaving the car at home.,,
The apartment itself is charming,it's in an older building so the apartment has lots of unique details (great molding,vintage kitchen,"high ceilings and windows which let in lots of natural light). They have it decorated in a very cozy way and I immediately felt at home or as if I were staying at a friend's place. \"",,
3870046,20434890,2014-09-29,20476205,Leigh,"As others have said, working with Brian is a breeze. He is very timely with info and very accurate with directions/instructions. He even gave several restaurant and activity recommendations. We never met in person but a few extra touches in the apartment were very friendly and made us comfortable!"
The location is perfect - about a $20 Uber ride from the airport. Once there we walked everywhere from the harbor to Fenway Park (although you may want to use Uber/Cab/T if you're tired!).,,,,,
"The apartment is charming with lots of character and nicely decorated. We felt at home and enjoyed our weekend in Boston. \"",,,,,

This apartment is very easy to stay in. It is up several flights of stairs so be ready to enter your stay with a quickened heart rate! I felt safe and could relax there, and I never saw anyone else in the building, very quiet."
3870046,21146815,2014-10-12,21318950,Maria,Brian and Lisa were excellent hosts right from the booking stage. Very quick to respond to emails and accommodating to our late check out request.
They provided us with all the information we needed to arrive and collect the keys smoothly.,,,,,
The apartment is exactly as listed,very charming,"eclectically decorated and comfortable.  Their attention to detail ensured we had all the comforts of home.

3870046,22282182,2014-11-02,19125112,Simon,Had a lovely two night stay at this wonderful apartment in Boston's Back Bay.  The location is ideal for exploring the many shops and restaurants in this smart area of the city.  The subway is also only a 10 minute walk away should you want to go further afield.
The apartment was relaxing with everything you would want from a 'home-away-from-home'.,,,,,
Brian and Lisa's communication was always very quick and helpful,and they were a pleasure to deal with.,,,,

The apartment was clean and close to everything, especially for the various events during marathon weekend.  Even if you're not a marathoner, this is a great, affordable place to stay while being able to walk everywhere in Back Bay.  It's also remarkably quiet considering it's central location.  Brian and Lisa were great hosts, and very communicative."

The subway station was only a few blocks away for the few times we didn't walk.  Brian and Lisa were great hosts.  They were very easy to communicate with leading up to our stay and also reached out to us during our stay to ensure everything was going well.  I would definitely recommend staying here.
3870046,37224801,2015-07-05,9451498,Thomas,Brian and Lisa were extremely responsive the whole time and very helpful once we arrived. The apartment was also super cute and in a wonderful location with 10-minute walks to everything we wanted to visit.

Their condo was in a terrific location very close to Copley Square.  Despite being in the middle of the action and close to numerous restaurants and shops, the building was quiet which we liked.   There were some steps to get to the unit (top floor) but that was not a problem for us and the view was impressive.  We give Brian and Lisa the highest marks and would not hesitate to recommend their unit.  Thanks Brian and Lisa!"

Location is great for tourism, we either walked or used Uber and taxis to visit the city. The AirbnB photos and description are accurate, furniture and decoration have a real personal touch. It is true that the second bedroom is small, and its window is on the ceiling - but all the other rooms are very spacious. Beds are comfortable. The weather was mild so we did not use neither heating nor AC."

Their home is very charming, comfortable, just-as-described, and perfectly situated!

13079659,78697582,2016-06-08,5658005,Pyae Phyo,"We didn't need to meet the host at all. The keys were in a locked box that we retrieved ourselves with the code that was provided. The place was very new, clean, and modern but it gets dusty. All utensils we needed to cook and eat were in the kitchen. The location is super convenient. The loft was right above a Bank of America ATM and the Orange T line, and across the street was a CVS and a Walgreens. The place was a short walk to the Boston Commons, the movie theater, a large selection of restaurants in Chinatown, and a number of clubs in the area . The loft was also 2 floors, with a slightly bigger bedroom and bathroom upstairs, and a bedroom and bathroom downstairs with a long hallway that led to the living room area, kitchen, and the stairs to the upper bedroom. We contacted the host (Flatbook) when we had an issue with the wifi and they were very helpful, and sent someone over to fix it very quickly. The central AC is ridiculously cold and it was starting to get hot in Boston, so that was great. However, the air-conditioning wasn't working in the bedroom on the lower floor so we had to blast off the AC outside and keep the bedroom door open to let in some air. Overall a really great place that was cheaper that any other hotel in the area. Would definitely stay here when I come back to Boston!"

6121709,36055555,2015-06-24,5489623,Deoben,Julie was a great host. Easy to communicate. I had issues on checking in since I was arriving into town so early. But she was able to help me to which I appreciated it. She gives you a lot of privacy to do whatever and even threw a couple recommendations in my way when figuring out what to do in the city. The location is pretty centralized... Easy to get around. So it was very convenient. Definitely felt like staying at her place was a great decision.
6121709,37812587,2015-07-10,37617807,Josh,"Julie was great to work with! She was super flexible on when I got there, nice to talk to and said to make myself at home. The room was right in the heart of Boston, very clean in general with a comfortable bed with clean sheets."
"I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. \"",,,,,
6121709,38507271,2015-07-16,31370610,Greg,"This accommodation is in a great location, directly across from the Hynes Convention Center, Prudential Tower, etc.  It is air conditioned and amazingly quiet despite its central location. Checking in and out was a breeze and no issues with coming and going as needed.  Julie is an excellent host quick to point out surrounding amenities.  There is a Trader Joe's downstairs and excellent eating establishments close by."
I enjoyed my time here and would not hesitate to stay again.,,,,,
One note,if you are not ready to climb four flights of stairs to get to the room,"this is not the place for you.  Worked great for me after eating too much almost every night though!\"",,,

Walking distance to several great spots (restaurants, bars, shopping, sight seeing) and close to the Boston T (subway system) and train station. If you prefer to hail a cab, several cabs drive by this place or there are cabs waiting just 2 blocks away."
Julie was great; accommodating,"flexible  and easy to get in contact with! I am from the Boston area so I already knew how to get around places and where to go. \"",,,,
6121709,46038862,2015-09-07,36005654,Lucy,"Julie was out of town for the weekend but her roommate was able to help me out with everything. She was very nice and accommodating, I immediately felt welcomed in the apartment. The location was amazing, it was basically in the center of everything, and it was really nice to walk down Boylston and Newbury with all the shops. Even though there are several subways within walking distance, I didn't feel the need to take it when exploring all the way to the heart of downtown. It's even within a nice walking distance from the Esplanade along the river. Couldn't have asked for a better location."
6121709,47435726,2015-09-18,18354275,Kosuke,"I stayed at Julie's place for 3 days to attend a conference in Boston. The apartment is in a great location for visiting Boston, so close to Newbury street, Back Bay station, Prudential Center, etc. There are Trader Joe's, Walgreens, and CVS nearby. The room is clean, quiet, and comfortable. Julie is a great host. She is kind and flexible as other reviewers commented.  I would definitely stay there again. Thanks Julie."

6121709,48872685,2015-09-29,15558846,Laura,Couldn't ask for a more convenient spot to stay at during my conference at the Hynes Convention Center. And the Airport Express bus takes you directly in front of the apartment (free to and from if you have a T pass)! It's the perfect place to sleep and unplug since there is no wifi :) Julie and her roommate were awesome and easygoing. Thanks for making my trip so easy!
6121709,49797473,2015-10-06,38834198,Vincent,"Upon arrival Julie greeted us in person and took time to explain some of the highlights of Boston that we should visit. The location of the apartment was excellent as it is close to many restaurants, shops and sight seeing spots such as the public library.  The room was as advertised. Nothing too fancy, but the mattress was comfortable. During our stay there was one issue (a clogged drain in the shower), but Julie replied to our messages promptly and had it fixed the next day."
6121709,50934374,2015-10-16,27660904,Suzanne,"Julie's apartment cannot be more perfectly situated in Back Bay.  She's directly across from the airport shuttle stop, within walking distance of great shops, amazing restaurants, and numerous tourist attractions.  Her apartment is clean, very quiet and she inadvertently has a full time doorman/ security guard since her place is snuggled between two fun bars below.  I always felt extremely safe coming home as the guys at the door knew me from the moment I arrived and made sure only the tenets or their guests were safe.  Julie is super sweet and a lovely host.  She provided me with all that I needed while I was there.  I hope to go back for a visit on personal time instead of business and can actually see all the sights I passed up."
6121709,51904809,2015-10-25,21635563,Bryson,"Julie was there to meet us with a smile right when we arrived..   She even gave us directions and phone #s to the nearest parking garages to her place to make it even easier..  Parking was right around corner!  Perfect place to stay for the real Boston downtown experience or for Convention center directly across the street..    Will def stay there next time I travel to Boston for either business or pleasure !  Was simple, affordable and right where you want to be!"

6121709,53829424,2015-11-13,44738553,Joan,"I stayed at Julie's place while attending a conference at the John Hynes Convention Center. I could not believe how convenient it was. I just had to cross the street and I was at the conference venue. There are alot of nice restaurants in the neighborhood, and a grocery store downstairs. Julie's place is as shown on airbnb, there were no surprises. If I ever return to the convention center, Julie's place will be the place to stay!"

-Cool location. Right next to prudential center and a few blocks from copley station,,,,,
-Didn't realize this until I left,but the Massport Logan Express bus to/from the airport has a stop right across the street,,,,

6121709,84004857,2016-07-05,14467675,Tru,Julie and Roomie Alex were wonderful hosts and the location of the apartment was amazing! Apartment was simple but perfect for a weekend getaway in Boston.
6121709,88875514,2016-07-25,68089562,Holly,Julie was a life saver and accepted my request to stay at her place after my previous reservation cancelled on me about 24 hours before my flight to Boston. The mattress on the floor was super comfy and the  room was very quiet. We had the place to ourselves most of the time. The only thing I might mention is that the apartment doesn't have a living room and there isn't really a place to lounge around but if you just need a quiet and comfy place to sleep and get a shower it's an excellent deal in a great location.
6121709,92030448,2016-08-07,78818917,Blair,"Julie's place was great for my first solo trip! Provided bare minimum essentials and was in a great location near shopping and restaurants. Nothing fancy but just right for my stay. There was no wi-fi but it ended up not being a big deal. While Julie wasn't able to meet me to give me the keys, I was able to easily pick them from the bar downstairs and stick them under the door upon departure. Check-in/check-out was flexible which was very convenient for me."

12262803,70045800,2016-04-15,21559936,David,Sean was the perfect host and this location and this price was a real steal.
By the way,a supermarket and bus stops to Harvard Square are a stone's throw in both directions. Nice neighborhood. I think I had about 5 minutes total interaction with Sean the entire time I was there (my choice),and he was still,without exception,"very friendly and at times even familiar. I'd bet on Sean and his friends here.\"",

She is a phenomenal incredible person who is not only very professional but also friendly, kind, caring and very sweet. I am really grateful that I had an opportunity to stay at her place and meet her. She is extremely hospitable, very clean, easy going and fun to talk to. Most importantly I felt very safe and the neighborhood was very quiet.  It is close to shopping and public transport. Additionally, the pictures are accurate but it's much better in person (you will see what I mean). This was my second time using Airbnb and I will definitely being using it again. Highly recommend staying at her place!"
"\"",,,,,
13937181,91462052,2016-08-05,50383602,Ugi,"Staying at Lelia place was like staying at home with my mother. She and the family are so caring, welcoming, and friendly. The house is beautiful, lot of flower decoration. The room is small but cozy enough to stay, with mini fridge inside which is very useful to store my son's milk and fruits. The neighborhood is safe and quite. We booked the room in last minutes before coming in, but Lelia made it possible for us. And her response was very prompt. She is really helpful. I love to stay at her house."
13937181,95373333,2016-08-19,84976349,Ali,"I needed a temporary place to live until my permanent apartment lease started. Lelia was extremely kind and very helpful with anything that I needed. I was very happy to have been staying at a place where she was the host because she made my transition to this new city, Boston, an easy one. She offered to make dinner for me at times, bought some food items I needed from the grocery store, installed an AC unit in the room so that I would not get hot, and she was very easy to talk to. The area is safe and public transit is not too difficult to the downtown area of Boston. The apartment was also very very clean! If I am back in that area, I will definitely stay in her house again."
13937181,99668431,2016-09-05,89918231,Joe,"Staying with Lelia was a pleasure- she made us feel home, even drove us to the metro and gave us tips for our commute around the city. The room is comfy and location is great- close to bus stops and the T. We definitely recommend you staying with her. Lets not forget the amazing coffee she makes in the morning!!!!!"
1066742,5363606,2013-06-26,5927106,Shannon,"Epic fun water adventure staying on Ryan's boat and traveling to/from Boston city center via water taxi. We are missing falling asleep to the rocking boat, views from the deck, and gorgeous sunsets. Thank you!"
1066742,5425092,2013-06-29,7052761,Gisele,"Staying on the yatch was a special experience. The yatch was well equiped. Sleeping was very confortable in the master bedroom, but you need to be young to sleep on the bunk bed. Satellite tv was on and off. People at the marina were really friendly and helpful  It was like a small village. Location is fantastic and safe. You need to have a phone to contact the taxi boat."
1066742,5723125,2013-07-13,7307707,Jean-François,"Un séjour original quand au mode d'hébergement, un accueil et un service de qualité de la part de Ryan, malgré la barrière de la langue, Une adresse a conseiller et recommander. Un seul bémol, l'environnement de l'emplacement du bateau qui aurait pu être mieux mais cela reste mineur car l'intérêt du voyage reste la visite de la ville de Boston."
1066742,6037418,2013-07-27,326498,Guy,"We had a really crazy travel schedule towards the end of a week in the Boston area, which meant we ended up looking for accommodations late in the evening, in the peak of a busy weekend. Ryan was remarkably responsive and flexible, making for a fantastic new experience.  This is definitely the way to see and stay in the Boston area.  The boat is wonderful, the water taxi serves the same dock- no crowds, free parking, no worries about traffic jams in and out of downtown- and a great host!"
1066742,6151770,2013-08-01,6791048,Molly,"The area where the boat is docked is not what we thought of as 'up and coming' - it is totally isolated and not walkable to anything interesting. The water taxi is the only way to get around and the schedule we were given was not accurate and made it very confusing to use. The boat itself had mold in the ceilings, bugs in the toilet and a small kitchen that is difficult to actually use because of the electrical outlets. We had many other complaints that space does not permit listing. This was like a camping experience and overall not worth the price. We feel it was misrepresented on the the website."
1066742,6215760,2013-08-04,6477501,Thierry,"A la découverte de Boston, l'arrivée est quelque peu surprenante en voiture. L'expérience de vie à bord est spartiate à 5, certainement plus confortable à 4. Quoiqu'il en soit ce fu un moment éminemment sympathique."
Quant à l'emplacement et les déplacements en véhicule à partir du bateau sont rapides et simples.,,,,,
"A refaire.\"",,,,,
1066742,6541055,2013-08-16,2448611,Mathilde,"\"C'est une manière originale de découvrir Boston. Le bateau est situé dans la partie Est de Boston, mais ce qui est très pratique, c'est le water taxi (compris dans la location, donc \"\"gratuit\"\") qui vient vous chercher à n'importe quelle heure entre 9 h et 21 h. Il faut disposer d'un téléphone cellulaire pour les appeler"
Le bateau en lui-même est bien équipé. Le wi-fi ne marche que sur le partie supérieure du bateau. Pour le reste,la douche est bien chaude et à volonté.,,,,
La marina est gardée par un enclos à code,ce qui fait que même si le bateau ne ferme qu'avec de tous petits loquets,on a pu laisser nos affaires en toute tranquillité.,,,
Nous étions 3 sur le bateau,ce qui est parfait. On peut y être à 4 mais la couchette avant est plutôt destinée aux enfants ou ados. Au delà de 4 personnes,il faut défaire une couchette qui vient se déployer dans l'espace de la salle à manger. Nous n'avons pas testé...,,,
Ryan est un hôte très disponible et serviable : il est venu nous chercher à l'aéroport très tard le soir alors que notre vol était très en retard. Il vaut mieux arriver avec lui sur les lieux.Ce n'est pas évident à trouver ... Il avait fait les courses avant notre arrivée pour le premier petit déjeuner du matin. Appréciable !,,,,,
Au total,"un super séjour sur ce bateau. Idéal avec des ados !\"",,,,
1066742,6694088,2013-08-21,1566215,Jesse,"The Zypher was the perfect get away for a days off!! Great boat, comfortable beds and more than enough space for two of us and my small dog. Ryan was very quick to respond and very helpful and also super nice! Would definitely stay here on another days off if I get the chance!!"
1066742,6757842,2013-08-24,7397256,Penelope,"The boat itself was fine for two people, as the forward cabin is reasonably comfortable. The rear cabin is claustrophobic, the mattresses thin, and especially on the bottom bunk, uncomfortably close to the head, the door of which did not close properly, so the chemical smell was strong. Somehow I had misread the PR, so thought the mooring was close to downtown Boston. I was prepared for the water taxi to be easily available, when I found I was mistaken. But it clearly required booking far in advance. Perhaps we were there at an exceptionally busy summer weekend, but I never managed to use it. We walked to the subway, about 20 minutes away, or called a cab, which came promptly from a local service, or drove, which required reasonably complex navigation through pretty heavy traffic, which we had hoped to avoid."
The area is interestingly various,and the working,industrial port is certainly atmospheric,if somewhat noisy. The marina itself is safe,easy and parking is as described. Ryan was helpful and available.,
Sitting outside on the bow deck in the early morning,eating delicious ripe mango from a nearby bodega,watching the ship across the harbour being loaded by two huge cranes,with a pleasant breeze cooling the sun,was memorable.,
And Ryan was untroubled by our two dogs,one of whom is a huge Irish wolfhound,who was luckily able to scramble up the stepladder to the deck,with only a little boosting from the rear. His enthusiastic welcome of our pets alone would encourage me to stay there again,and recommend the experience.,
"\"",,,,,
1066742,7086248,2013-09-05,6694777,Ann-Christin,The boat was great! We had a very good time. We stayed with 6 people which was fine (a bit tiny but for a weekend it's okay). The water taxi was great to get around. Also Ryan was a very good host.
"All in all it is a very good place to stay at in Boston area!\"",,,,,
1066742,17989037,2014-08-19,14137627,JoEllen,"We had a wonderful experience staying on Ryan's yacht! Ryan was very communicative, easy to reach, and provided all we needed for our stay. We would definitely stay with him again, and recommend his place to others!"
1066742,19561000,2014-09-14,20117026,Chad,Ryan was a good host. We had one minor problem which he corrected promptly. The boat was in good condition and we enjoyed our stay. The bathrooms are a bit cramped but that should be expected. The neighborhood is most Hispanic. I recommend Casa de Columbia for brekkie and Mi Publito for dinner. Try the Loroco Pupusas!
1066742,19906683,2014-09-20,21258770,Craig,"Loved my stay on the boat, great alternative to a hotel! It was a unique experience for sure, highly recommend it!"
1066742,20723614,2014-10-04,4405579,J.L.,A very unique experience with some unfortunate issues that could not get worked out. Thought we could have a fun non-hotel experience while on a business trip. Hot water was only available for 1 out of 4 days and this was very uncomfortable given that I was with clients all week. Ryan sent over a manager each day that was unable to fix the problem.
1066742,22769697,2014-11-14,22608406,Jen,"The stay was great, boat was well heated which was much needed in the cold weather. The water taxi was on call and we never had a booking issue. Also used the metro the get back a few times which was close enough."
1066742,54829726,2015-11-23,18295143,Jordan,It was a nice peaceful neighborhood. Always fun to wake up on the water. Great stay!
1066742,69900545,2016-04-14,61403002,Katherine,"I had never stayed on a boat before. It was like staying in an RV. Ryan and Diego were great, very helpful in helping us get to the Boat. The heater kept the boat nice and warm. We took the water Taxi from the Airport, such as fun experience. The driver even gave us some ideas on what to go see in different areas around Boston."
1066742,72138801,2016-05-01,67048319,Kinnari,"The host was very welcoming. We initially had a problem where the boat we originally booked, was double booked so we were offered the Zephyr as a replacement (at half the price). The Zephyr did not have a grill (which we were very interested in), so Ryan went out of his way to make sure we had a grill for our house boat."
The boat however was not at all what we expected it to be. It was very old in quality.( the cabin was falling apart). Both the toilets required hand pumps and had a very strong smell to them. (we expected the bathroom to be narrow but not to be manually operated).,,,,,
The kitchen drawers were falling off the hinges and looked as if they haven't been cleaned in a while which goes for all the appliances on the boat including the fridge.,,,,,
The first night the power tripped twice and Ryan came right over to fix it. The master bedroom however had a difficult to operate heater which turned off both nights. It got very cold. The bedding however,was nice and clean and thankfully,warm.,,,
While operating the stove (single burner plug-in),the power tripped again and we didn't realize that the fridge was connected to that bunch of cables,so all of Saturday into Sunday the fridge stayed off and the boat developed a very rotten smell. (Initially we thought it was the toilet system).,,,
The boat states it sleeps 6 but it only sleeps four comfortably. The pull out sofa wouldn't pull out due to lack of space so our fifth family member ended up just sleeping on the closed sofa. (So spacially,the boat is perfect for four),,,,
The shower and toilet situation were terrible,but we were told by a neighbor there was a shower and bathroom located at the top of the marina enterance (maybe a 3 minute walk). And it was wonderful,that is where we used the restroom and showers for the remainder of the weekend.,,,
We ended up not using the water taxi because it was expensive for our group,but they were very close by and available at a moments notice.,,,,
All in all we wouldn't use that boat again ever. It was the worst experience we have all ever had. But the host was wonderful and a lot of his more expensive boats look to be way better quality and worth the price.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1066742,74409953,2016-05-15,50863077,Hope,Ryan was a great host. Very accommodating to our schedule. Answered any questions very promptly. The boat was great. The beds were comfortable and it was pretty spacious. We definitely enjoyed our time.

"Thank you for everything :)\"",,,,,
1066742,80376101,2016-06-17,25245356,Chris,The boat was clean and well maintained.  Ryan was responded promptly to my queries prior to arrival and one of Ryan's colleagues met me when I arrived and gave me a short tour.  I had to commute into the center of Boston everyday so didn't spend too much time on the boat unfortunately.  Uber worked quite well getting to and from the area.
1066742,81319106,2016-06-22,32702298,Becky,My husband is a boat/water and airplane person so when we saw this listing we knew this was where we wanted to stay for a different Boston experience - the Zephyr did not disappoint.  We found the marina to be convenient and the boat layout comfortable and descriptions to be accurate.
"Ryan responded promptly to all of my correspondence. \"",,,,,
1066742,84234813,2016-07-06,69567224,Carrie,Convenient location.  Our boat the Zephyr wasn't clean. Kitchen had dirty counters and old garbage in the bin. The bathrooms were very dirty and and smelled.  There were plug in air freshners  everywhere on the boat trying to mask the smells.  This boat is definitely showing its age.  On the positive side Ryan is very accommodating and easy to contact.
"There seems to be newer houseboats at the marina that look to be a lot nicer.\"",,,,,
1066742,85525531,2016-07-11,75053894,James,Very comfortable quite and peaceful would definitely stay there again.
1066742,87802777,2016-07-21,33872153,Davin,I stayed on the Zephyr mid-week last week and both Ryan and Diego went out of there way to be accommodating during my stay. The Zephyr is in East Boston which is a bit outside of the action but just a short Uber ride to Back Bay and the rest of scenic Boston. It was certainly a unique experience staying on a classic yacht like the Zephyr instead of a hotel and overall I enjoyed the experience. While it's a 1969 yacht so it's obvious going to be a bit older inside it still had a ton of charm to it and it was great drinking coffee on the bow each morning. I'd say if you don't go in expecting  opulence and you like a bit of adventure outside the norm you'll absolutely enjoy your stay. They also have a couple of houseboats in the slips next to the Zephyr which were fairly new and nice inside. Thanks again Ryan and Diego!
1066742,89741380,2016-07-29,9073343,Elsa,Expérience intéressante mais pas à la hauteur de nos attentes pour le prix payé. Le bateau est vieux et l'emplacement n'est pas idéal. Le secteur est industriel mais surtout bruyant en raison du pont et de l'aeroport à proximité. Contrairement à ce qu'on nous avait promis il n'y avait pas de water taxi offert.
1066742,90601739,2016-08-01,67474945,Marie-France,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1066742,96329330,2016-08-22,73779928,Wendy,We had a terrific time..such a great  4 night get away..Ryan and Diego were excellent  to  deal with. Loved the area even though it was not in (URL HIDDEN) was a quick inexpensive  uber trip into downtown. Loved seeing the drawbridge go up and the boats go into the harbor. My boyfriend and I would definitely  go back and would highly recommend to others..bed in stateroom was super comfy with pillow top..
1066742,98060831,2016-08-29,86473347,David,It was a great stay on the Zephyr.  I appreciated the fact that Ryan was in accessible via text and we were allowed to check in a little earlier than expected.  The boat was great; comfortably housing 4 middle aged guys for a long weekend.

14460344,93123414,2016-08-11,72109595,Valerie,"My brother and I stayed for the night, we just needed a place to crash and came across Ellen's ad. We never really met her, but we met her husband Michael who seemed pretty nice. The place was okay but I don't think I would come back; it was a bit dirty, or maybe I'm just a neat freak."
14460344,93786568,2016-08-14,71590294,Hernán,"Ellen y Michael nos hicieron sentir como en casa. Aunque estuvimos solo por dos noches y la mayor parte del tiempo recorriendo la ciudad, encontramos un lugar muy tranquilo, muy comodo y aunque algo alejado del centro de Boston, en 30 minutos lograbamos llegar.  de la estacion del metro, unos 15 minutos a pie, ya que el bus no suele pasar seguido.  muy confortables las camas y muy limpio todo.  muchas gracias a ambos."
14460344,94782476,2016-08-17,83509824,Yifan,"Ellen was very nice and patient for my new arrival, and I felt at home when I saw a warm welcome on my room door. The house was clean and comfortable. All other family members are helpful and nice, and the 2 kids were especially adorable. I like the location of the house, the 86 bus is within 1-minute walk and it can take you to Harvard Square. I will certainly go back if I visit Boston again."
14460344,97372263,2016-08-27,90341100,Sarah,"We didn't get to meet Ellen, but her husband Michael was an excellent host! The overall feel of the place is like staying in a friend's home, but the cleanliness and amenities of the room made it feel quite private as well. On very short notice, we requested to stay two nights, and on the second, our friend stayed with us. Ellen and Michael had no problem with allowing a third (discussed in advance). We very much enjoyed our stay thanks to comfy beds and Michael's kind and helpful personality."
14460344,98062247,2016-08-29,90135524,Brian,"Nice neighborhood, easy and smooth stay"
14460344,98120024,2016-08-29,87033229,Aaron,"Ellen and Mike were great hosts, really friendly and lovely hosts. The room was well set up with everything you could need and they were very flexible and accomodating!"
7630340,45731075,2015-09-05,10507403,Shomit,"Lovely flat, great location in Boston. Parking space is really useful too."
7630340,46188867,2015-09-08,41759213,Samantha,"We had a great time! Host (Eddie) was very welcoming and offered some good recommendations. Apartment is clean and bed is comfy, full kitchen with new appliances and air conditioning. Neighborhood was good, quiet and very conveniently located to explore Boston. Walking distance to pretty much everything. Parking was easy. Well equipped with everything you could need!"
7630340,47811354,2015-09-21,43381954,Zhichen,"Good price for the location, but the furnitures are quite old and untidy. Comforter has smell."
7630340,48727031,2015-09-28,8934360,Nicholas,"Wonderful experience for our first time in Boston.  Alan's place was within walking distance to many things we wanted to see and a short uber ride to the rest.  His point of contact Ed was extremely helpful with everything we needed.  The place was clean, things are new, and we have no complaints.  Next time we are in Boston we'd certainly see if this place is available again."
7630340,49051904,2015-09-30,44305838,Shannon,"Great location near China town, and a playground opposite the street for children. Nice place with two bedrooms and a kitchen. Surely a good recommendation. Alan and Eddie were both helpful and nice."
7630340,49625200,2015-10-05,2244958,Melissa,I did not meet my host but his property manager did come by to welcome us. We had a nice chat. The apartment met our needs. The immediate neighborhood was not particularly charming but it was very convenient.
7630340,50297402,2015-10-11,9349608,Alina,"I stayed at this apartment with three of my colleagues when we travelled to Boston for a conference. The apartment is exactly as pictured, and it is located within a short walking distance from the Public Gardens/Boston Common, and a longer, but very doable walking distance from North End, Waterfront, Beacon Hill, etc. There was plenty of space for the four of us (we shared the two beds). Eddie (the property manager) was very easy to communicate with, and responded very promptly to our every question and request. The place is still very new, so there are still some kinks that Eddie and Alan are working out, but they are doing a fantastic job of accommodating their guests. So if you are bothered by something, let Eddie know - he will do his best to make it better. For example, I mentioned to Eddie that we could really use a mirror in addition to the small one in the bathroom, and it was in the apartment within 3 hours. He was also very gracious in allowing us to check out later than the regular time. Overall, our experience was a very pleasant one."
7630340,51129123,2015-10-18,41602421,Marie-Claude,"We did not meet Alan but Eddie, the property manager, who let us in the apartment. Communication was easy, and he was there to meet us on time. We stayed at the studio on the first floor, which was very comfortable, but we had to leave the blinds down as we wouldn’t have had any privacy at all otherwise. Unlike the other properties we had stayed at, there was no coffee (not even filters) but the studio is well located, close to the theatres, and the subway, there are many restaurants nearby, and it is reasonably priced."
7630340,51616542,2015-10-22,18012965,Amy,"We were greeted by Eddie who showed gave us all the info. The location was good. It was close to everything we needed. The bed was new and super comfy. The place is very old, yet it is a new property for them. They have put in a lot of new things, but I felt like a few things were a bit dirty because of the age. They did have a coffee maker but no filters or coffee."
7630340,52692310,2015-11-01,1451794,Jorge & Jessica,"Everything went incredibly well during our stay in Alan's apartment. The apartment itself is located in a very quiet and safe part of the theater district which was much appreciated when wanting to escape the Halloween festivities. Since everything and everywhere is pretty much walkable, we didn't get the feeling we were missing out on anything. The inside of the apartment was clean and as described in the listing itself, no surprises. Alan was super responsive (often getting back to us in less than a minute!!) and amendable to a unique check-in situation. All in all, we were very happy with our stay and would not hesitate to book this apartment again. Thanks Alan!!"
7630340,54030839,2015-11-15,48001122,Chad,"Eddie was awesome! He met us at the building and showed us around, helped me to the parking space, and had an extensive knowledge of the sights and key locations around the area."
7630340,54763528,2015-11-23,30069770,卉然,"We had a pretty nice experience there, the location is convenient and easy to find. Although we have not seen Alan, we are pretty glad to live in his apt for 2 days!"
7630340,58234895,2016-01-01,25911496,Alex,"Neighborhood wasn't bad but apartment was dingy and dark. Not worth the money.  Parking was not included as indicated in the listing and had to haggle over the parking. He wanted to charge $30 a night for parking. Upon checking in, keys were wet and sticky with who knows what. Apartment not kept up with. Light bulbs out everywhere, dirty floors, not very clean overall. Would rather spend a little bit more money and stay in a hotel. Worst air Bnb I've stayed in for the price."
7630340,59269258,2016-01-08,43939040,Mike,Great value . Location was great . Property Manager was welcoming
7630340,59343354,2016-01-09,4291350,Mitchell,"Our host was great and very accommodating! He gave us a ton of information about the neighborhood, and let us leave our bags for a few hours after check in so we could get some breakfast. The apartment was clean, spacious, and in a great location."
7630340,59793699,2016-01-15,4491477,Cory,"This apartment is a great find!  It's actually way bigger than it looks like and technically has two bedrooms (1 private and one studio-style) each with a large bed which makes it a good fit for 2 people or 2 couples.  The bathroom and kitchen are large and clean and it's a great comfortable place.  The location is amazing, a short 10-15 minute walk to South Station with easy access to the T.  There is also a Whole Foods 10 minute walk away and it's right near Chinatown where you can find great, cheap food.  Alan and his partner Eddie are great hosts who are fast to reply to your needs and make check-in easy.  They manage a few other places in the city but treat each guest and each property with a personal touch.  Overall, a great place to stay in Boston!"
7630340,59961828,2016-01-17,54070037,Valerie,The apartment was very well kept and stocked with all the amenities listed in their description. Upon arrival we met up with Eddie and were given a small tour as well as parking and check out procedure. It was all simple and straight forward. Eddie himself was very kind and personable. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Alan. Overall it was a great experience staying in there space.
7630340,64214379,2016-03-01,25313796,Kaye,"\"Eddie, the landlord, was very nice and accommodating. We requested a desk to use during out stay and he immediately brought one by the next day.  Every thing that you need for a comfortable stay is provided. The space is more of a studio, with an additional room for the second bed but spacious enough for the two of us. This is by no means a \"\"luxury\"\" hotel"
7630340,65102936,2016-03-10,10969148,Colby,"Alan was very quick to respond and help with anything.  The place is geared more for a younger traveler or college student, not so much a business traveler."
7630340,66237978,2016-03-20,9818800,Brad,Great place with an excellent location.
7630340,67339952,2016-03-28,8011725,Kobi,"We had a trip planned for months, and the night before we flew into the city, our host cancelled on us due to flooding in the home. After scrambling to find a new place that was close to where we needed to be, Alan came through in the clutch and saved our trip but taking us in at the last minute. The home was great and Alan's communication was prompt. I would highly recommend staying at Alan's."
7630340,69444740,2016-04-11,47012883,Christine,"We had a fantastic, warm welcome to Boston by Eddie. Check in/check out processes are very easy. This is a great location where we walked to everything including shopping, transport & sightseeing. The kitchen has everything you need for cooking and the apartment is clean, neat and as described. We felt safe as a family here. I would definitely stay here again and definitely recommend."
7630340,70798499,2016-04-20,1603303,Michael,"Exchange with host was super easy, friendly, and very welcoming.  Location is perfect for visiting Boston.  Tufts Med Center T is within a short walk.  Commons and other sights are easily within walking distance as well.  A Whole Foods is also super close and convenient."
Only thing to note about the space is that there is not much privacy between the tow bedroom spaces.  The apartment is setup more as an efficiency/studio with an extra bedroom to the side.  Was not an issue for us,"but I feel it is worth noting since the description does not clearly mention this aspect.  \"",,,,
7630340,71347042,2016-04-24,20160521,Michael,"Excellent accommodations, though slightly smaller than anticipated, it definitely served its purpose. But Alan and Eddie were awesome, responsive, and helpful. There was a slight mix up of guests/rooms but it was sorted out immediately and everything ran smoothly from there. I would absolutely stay again."
7630340,73039307,2016-05-06,17124474,Tayla,"We met with the property manager initially and he was lovely and very helpful. He gave us an introduction to the area, to Boston and showed us around. There was also a resident downstairs who was in touch with the landlord who was very friendly, which was handy when we couldn't work the blinds! Both were very accommodating and went above and beyond to make us feel looked after."
Be aware that the walls are VERY thin - there were guests upstairs who were a little noisy and we could hear every step they took as if they were in the room.,,,,,
"The listing was accurate and the area was perfect for us.\"",,,,,
7630340,74471174,2016-05-15,35228479,Bethany,Eddie was a fantastic host and was very attentive. The check in and check out process was very easy. The apartment itself is well appointed. Unfortunately the building is older (as many are in Boston) which meant you could hear what was going on in the other apartments. We had a bachelor party staying above us so we did not get much sleep. This was out of the control of the hosts as it was not their unit.
7630340,74927498,2016-05-17,627898,Peter,"Good communications from this multi-unit host, then his assistant, then a greeter who was not able to meet us at the unit at agreed time 10pm.  Neighborhood is very mixed, and the cover photo is not even close to where you would be staying. Code-lock doors made entry easy, but trickier to lock when leaving.  Place is simple and clean, but noisy, as converted rooms on the 2nd floor are against thin hallway doors with foot traffic past midnight. All the bathroom supplies you'd ever need, but no Bfast, bottled water nor condiments, so more like an economy apartment then a B&B."
7630340,75119192,2016-05-19,9475609,Rahsaan,"The place was clean and usable for sleeping purposes. There just was not too much you can do in there. Also, apparently the floors seem to have been an issue as the residents downstairs were complaining about loud foot steps at night."
7630340,75589375,2016-05-22,4651117,Jacob,"The apartment is really close to the centre of Boston in a great location. About a 10min walk from Boston Common. We needed 2 bedrooms for our visit so the apartment fitted the brief. Alan and Eddie were very helpful in answering all of our questions, before and during our visit. Eddie in particular had great local knowledge and tips of what to do and where to go when we arrived. There are a lot of doors, not walls, that back on to the landing area/staircase and the ceiling is really thin so it got a bit noisy at times when people stumbled home late at night. The apartment was spacious but some things were a bit worse for wear. Some of the blinds didn't work properly and the bathroom could have been a bit cleaner. Other than that, we had a nice stay."
7630340,77891510,2016-06-04,50082734,Janisa,It was such a pleasant stay at Alan's place. So close to everything & great privacy!
7630340,78607594,2016-06-07,56216026,Ashley,"The apartment was exactly as pictured, and located in Chinatown. We weren't in the apartment for anything other to sleep, and the location was great. We could walk to everything and felt safe regardless of the time. The room is very noisy if there are upstairs renters, but fortunately that only lasted a night for us. All in all, a great spot when visiting Boston in terms of location and value!"
7630340,79188969,2016-06-11,11018609,Scott,"Great location, nice having the second bed."
7630340,80480689,2016-06-18,60173235,Martina,"The communication with Eddie and Alan was good. We haven´t met with any of the hosts though. I was texted instructions on how to enter the apartment as well as the internet access info. The apartment is in a great location, very central and safe. Eddie was helpful when I intended to communicate the apartment settings because we were two colleagues who didn´t want to share rooms but wouldn´t mind sharing apartment. Therefore, I was surprised the one bedroom didn´t have private entrance and I had to go through my colleague´s room. It was not a big deal but I think this could have been communicated better. Also, I think the cleaning could have been done more thoroughly (namely the oven). Furthermore, if there are any noisy guests upstairs, you could literally hear everything. Otherwise, it was a pleasant stay."
7630340,81493272,2016-06-23,40469917,Daniel,"Overall the stay was ok. The tiny AC unit did not cool the whole place even thought it was on high the whole time. The area was friendly and had enough food options. I was traveling for business, so I didn't really venture out to much."
7630340,84287368,2016-07-06,3575222,Karl,Alan's place was exactly as described; very central and clean and tidy. Alan was also exceptionally accommodating with our travel schedule.
"Would fully recommend staying at this place.\"",,,,,
7630340,85188549,2016-07-10,8708062,Sandra,The apartment is too noisy. The neightboors are not friendly in regards to the noise. We didn't sleep fine all the weekend!
But the apartment is very closed of all the attractions. Good place to be.,,,,,
"It's very clean\"",,,,,
7630340,86553224,2016-07-16,69041203,Peter,We never met the host. We communicated via email only.  Since we didn't have any American contact I had to find free wifi location to check emails to contact.
"\"",,,,,
7630340,88201420,2016-07-23,41198745,John,Working with Alan was simple. Really liked the keyless entry.  It went seamlessly.
The unit was nice. The utensils and cups needed to be washed. The people upstairs sounded right on top of you.,,,,,
The location was good.  The units second bed was in a closet,"kind of weird.  Overall OK experience.  \"",,,,
7630340,91630855,2016-08-06,19028624,Mark,"Stay was great. Previous host canceled on us last minute and Alan came through with a quick response, making sure we still had a place to crash for that week."
7630340,93346303,2016-08-12,87724401,Danny,Host made me feel welcomed. The neighborhood is convenient. It was a good value.
13959444,87734122,2016-07-21,82112541,Greg,This was my first experience with Airbnb and it couldn't have been better.  Susan was on top of things from beginning to end. Her home in Boston is top notch! She even provided breakfast items for us as a courtesy. Couldn't have asked for a a better hostess or property.
13959444,88138975,2016-07-23,18733182,Sandra,The space was beautiful and Sue was very friendly and welcoming. We enjoyed our stay very much! Thanks
13959444,89402373,2016-07-28,29958021,Chris,"I consistently stay with Airbnb due to travel for my job, and Susan's flat was my best experience yet - hands down!  The flat itself was immaculate, modern, and fashionably furnished.  I turned down a nearby hotel to stay here while visiting a client and I could not have been happier!"
She and her husband greeted me the night I arrived and made me feel right at home.  They were even kind enough to provide supplies for breakfast and ensured every possible amenity was available to me.,,,,,
The surrounding area offers a great flavor of local Boston.  SRV,the italian place around the corner is amazing,but there's also several chain locations,including a Whole Foods around the block.,,
I would highly recommend Susan's flat for your next visit!,,,,,

13959444,90505833,2016-08-01,84725295,Francis,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was amazing. The attention to detail in this new apartment was second to none, it really did feel like a home from home. Susan was always available for tips and hints re the Boston area, and this made it all the more enjoyable for us. The location for the orange and green 'T' lines was also really convenient. If you are coming to Boston then put this property on your list, you will not be disappointed."
Finally,a big thank you from the 3 of us. If we come back to Boston we will definitely be looking at your apartments again.,,,,
Kind Regards,,,,,

She really cares about your comfort and enjoyment not just of her place, but of her city!  If you had any doubt if whether this property is as gorgeous as the photos, put them to rest. It is beyond stunning - she has incredible taste, everything she chose from the finishes to the cookware is top notch. She provides condiments and even breakfast items...I can't say enough. I've only stayed at 3 airbnbs so far but this host and this property blow the others out of the water. Would definitely recommend AND return!  Thanks so much Susan!"
13959444,95299438,2016-08-19,40407868,Randy,The listing was like described but even better. Susan was extremely nice and a lovely person.  Will stay here again.

12971329,82314778,2016-06-27,72136261,Sudeepa,"Jean provided a very comfortable stay and was a great host. She was out when I reached there. However she has arranged everything on time. It’s a room from 2BHK apartment and located very close (3-5 mins walk, 0.4 miles) to the subway station. If you get in a UBER from the airport you can reach the place in around 15-20 mins costing around $20-25. You can get Silver Line bus from airport to Boston South Station and get Red Line train from Boston South Station to Ashmont station and 3-5 mins walk from there. Trains are available till 1.00 AM every 10 mins intervals and very convenient on travelling to downtown. Room is nice, bed was very comfortable and exactly opposite to the bath room which was convenient too. Area was very safe too. Also she supported\\guided on visiting places in Boston too.  I really enjoyed my stay at Jeans place and recommend for anyone visiting Boston."

2931271,15975638,2014-07-19,17446817,Swati,"Cynthia and her family were outstanding hosts.  We had a great time staying with them.  Breakfast was great, and we enjoyed having it in the dining room, with the feeling of a home rather than a hotel.  The rooms and house were comfortable.  The public transit system is convenient and easy to access from the house, and its easy to get to downtown Boston."
2931271,16667655,2014-07-31,16914972,Annie,"Cynthia was great, very communicative leading up to our stay and warm and welcoming once we arrived. The house was clean, the rooms were cool and everything was comfortable."
The only problem was,i wasn't prepared for a dog and cat... it may have been mentioned on her profile,but that was an unpleasant surprise for some of our group.,,,
She was a kind host. We had a very short stay,basically only there for sleeping. Breakfast was DIY,"and we just didn't have time for more than a cup of coffee and a bagel (which we had brought with us to share).\"",,,
2931271,17619444,2014-08-15,13085659,Maxime,"Cynthia and her family were very welcoming. They made sure we had everything we needed. The house is a little far from the center but they gave us tips to get there easily. The rooms were nice and spacious. We were particularly pleased by the room on the last floor, with its double bed, two single beds and a private bathroom."

Our group of 5 was easily and comfortably accommodated in the three large, spacious, and clean rooms. Cynthia and her husband Keith were excellent hosts, and were always friendly, helpful and accommodating. Most of all, we appreciated how they went out of their way to do the little things for us, including cooking us delicious Jamaican-style breakfast and personally driving us to the train station. They were also very knowledgeable of the entirety of Boston and gave us many helpful tips on where to go and eat, which attractions to visit, and which areas to avoid. Overall we were very pleased and would highly recommend their beautiful home to anyone looking to spend a few days in Boston at an affordable price."

I have known people that kept pet's in their homes but I never had to take that kind of stench these people/host\\zoo keepers had better get their act together before word gets out and the health department is summoned to pay them a visit .I can go on and on about my unfortunate and unhealthy experience but I have other things to take care of at this time , I do still have 1 question in the back of my mind who are these people that gave such good reviews about this place we're they paid to do that or are they family members doing a favor lol either way people beware of these inconsiderate people that are only interested in getting your money without having the decency to at least reciprocate with comfortable accommodations for the paying customer . Have a wonderful day everyone ."

She was such an awesome host I would definitely recommend staying with her. This was our first airbnb and because of her I will be willing to use the service again.

She was extremely helpful once we got there, giving us suggestions for food and places to look for apartments. She has lived in her building for over 15 years, so she definitely knows the area. Parking was super easy, and her apartment is in a super safe neighborhood with lots of great food and drinks in walking distance. Easy access to downtown, over all really convenient."

We didn't have much time to visit but really enjoyed the little bit of time we did get to spend with Christina."

3659917,19381733,2014-09-11,19314048,Natalia,It was an amazing first experience with airbnb.
The apartment is clean and comfortable,the same I can say about the room. I was provided with all I needed like towels,iron,full equipped kitchen,laundry in a basement and nice hostess. I found this location quite convenient: 3 lines of T in a working distance and bus to downtown just in front of the building,it took only 20 minutes to get to the Prudential.
I spent 9 days with Christina Marie and even started to call her my roommate. Christina Marie is very hospitable and pleasant person. She will respect your privacy,"help you with an information about city and any question you might have. She stayed in contact with me all days to make sure I'm comfortable.

There is a whole foods nearby that was about a 5 minute walk. It is also a quiet and cozy place that was nice to come home to!  The only thing worth mentioning is there was no microwave for warming food up, but wasn't that big of a deal afterall! I would recommend this place for those who want a quiet, cozy place just outside of the main parts of Boston."
3659917,23867520,2014-12-13,23494661,Julia,"This was a great place to stay! I was traveling alone for residency interviews and spent two nights here. Christina Marie was very easy to reach and communicative before I arrived and was able to buzz me into her building remotely when I got there. She left a list of helpful transportation tips and was just generally welcoming. Her place was very quiet, cozy, and relaxing. I had a great experience and would recommend to anyone!"
3659917,25037074,2015-01-05,8997595,Pallavi,"Christina was very welcoming and warm. The house was nice and clean and Christina made sure I had all the information to reach the important places like whole foods and Prudential center. There is a bus stop just opposite to the house which takes you directly to Sheraton/Marriott complex and hence it was very convenient. The apartment building is a little old and I had a little hiccup of the lock getting jammed when Christina was not around..but as soon as she knew about the problem, she helped me out and got the lock replaced the next day. Overall a very warm stay!"
3659917,25995344,2015-02-01,24053706,Simon,"I stayed almost a month with Christina when I was doing a medical clerkship at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Christina was always very friendly, considerate, and helpful. On the occasions that we were both at home and awake at the same time, she was pleasant company. The flat is clean and very comfortable - in fact, I slept better in her guest room bed than I do at home. The flat is in a good location, with a bus stop right across the street taking me to the hospital. Overall, I'm happy that I stayed with Christina during my month in Boston."

I found her warm and generous about her apartment - She made it clear that anything in the kitchen or bathroom was available.  The location was extremely convenient for me, as I took full advantage of the 39 bus to get up into Boston proper.  It's also close to the riverwalk which is a great place to run or walk.  The building is quiet and well-kept.  If you're looking for a nightlife kind of area, this isn't it, but Boston is compact enough that you can get to less residential areas very easily.  I'd definitely go back to this place if the need arises."

In addition to being flexible with my arrival and departure times, she made herself available to answer all of my questions, communicated well in person, by email and text, and gave me friendly tips on places to eat and how to catch the bus to the Hynes Convention Center (an easy 20-min ride from her place).  She even offered me free run of the food in her kitchen.

Her home has a lot of positive vibes and feels like home .. She has tucked positive thoughts in the little corners of her house which have a very relaxing effect..Her home wifi is superb and I could easily do whatsap calls and FaceTime with smooth streaming! The place as mentioned is at a very convenient location the only drawback that came across was that there is no elevator in the building and we need to carry the luggage up for one floor ..but that's ok if you're staying for long and don't need to carry it out too often..Rooms are clean, kitchen very well organised. It is located on the green line route. The no.39 bus is 60feet and the Heath street subway stop ( the last stop on green line) is 8 minutes walk from the apartment. Almost all tourist attraction as well as the medical area can be easily reached via the green line starting from hospitals at longwood avenue, fine arts museum, boylston area, aquarium and Bay Area, museum of science .. If you stay here for a week or more it's a good idea to get a subway pass for the 20$ for week (or month) as it allows unlimited travel using the bus or subway."

8579799,50608229,2015-10-12,12340193,Matthew,"Only one word can describe our Columbus Day stay in Boston — FABULOUS!  In terms of the cleanliness of the space, receptiveness of the host, and value more generally, this was one of the most positive Airbnb experiences that I have had to-date.  I would encourage anyone seeking to visit Boston — whether for recreation or work — to consider staying here.  The location is central to all major neighborhoods in the city, and the Green Line is easily accessible.  Moreover, the neighborhood itself is lovely and made for a delightful Sunday morning stroll.  The next time that I need a place in Boston, this will be my first choice.  As I noted it's not just fantastic it's FABULOUS!"

The apartment met our needs very well, giving us a place to cook our meals. The couch was super comfy to sleep on, and I imagine the bed was as well for my teammate."
Asasia is very responsive to questions you have during your stay,and is very helpful as a host. She will take care of you in whatever way she is able!,,,,
We stayed here for the Head of the Charles Regatta and for rowers looking in the future,it's about a half hour to 45 minute walk from the FALS area through a few neighborhoods and small shopping districts in Allston and Brighton. There's a star market a few minutes walk away towards BU,"and a Whole Foods about a 20 minute walk uphill.\"",,,

Walked to Fenway for a game. We squeezed five people. While it was tight it worked fine. She has an awesome air mattress! Also had great tv options too. Would definitely recommend staying here.
8579799,98111039,2016-08-29,31938404,Kyle,Asasia's cozy apartment in the heart of Comm Ave made it super easy to get both down to BC and over toward Fenway and downtown. I'll definitely be looking it up again next time I head to Boston!

6248970,44143975,2015-08-24,38016712,Janet Eager,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I'd have to say it was perfectly acceptable. The location was most important to me because I really wanted to be within easy walking distance to relatives who live nearby. It couldn't have been any easier. The area is delightful and remarkably quiet in the evenings. I was there from mid-week through the weekend. Saturday night there was a small party going on across the street and I was just aware of music, happily shrieking children and additional traffic, but it was very quiet in the third floor apartment. As a matter of fact, I was barely aware that there were tenants below, and can only confirm there were tenants on the first floor because I had a pleasant visit with her and her puppy downstairs one day. If there were people on the second floor, I never heard them.  The accommodations were spartan, neat and comfortable. As the hosts were not present during the time I was there, we communicated exclusively through texts and email. I had travel troubles coming into Boston and arrived much later at night than I had anticipated.  Shawn was responsive to all my hasty notes AND sympathetic. I really appreciated the automatic lighting on the porch and stairs.I was a pretty busy tourist, and regret that I didn't have time to even sit outside on the deck. I wish I had. It's certainly likely that I will be back in Boston and I when I do I'll be back in touch."
6248970,44478481,2015-08-26,3388840,Elena,"Staying at Shawn's was just what  needed: a comfortable, spacious and clean room (with a view!) with a private bathroom, in a quiet and comfortable apartment. The location was very convenient and Shawn helped me with everything I asked. There were many options within walking distance (food shopping, restaurants, a park) and it was also convenient to public transportation. A plus: the apartment was nice and cool on hot summer days! (And this is coming from someone who usually doesn't like air-conditioning...)"

House is at walking distance from a T station and is fairly easy to get from there to the main points in the city.

Even though we eventually didn't meet in person he kept me well informed about how to get there.,,,,,
Cleanly,spacious room,clean bathroom,towels and he would also let me use his well equipped kitchen.,,

His warm personality made me feel like a family friend had agreed to let me stay at his place after learning that I would be visiting Boston. The room was as pictured, and it was very comfortable with a desk & chair, chest of drawers, and hangers in the closet. The bathroom was modern and clean. There were helpful notes on the doors as well as a printout in the room with information about local shopping/dining. I felt safe walking in the neighborhood when I made my way to the Stop and Shop. An Uber ride into Cambridge was around $10. Also, the train station was in easy walking distance. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
6248970,51333036,2015-10-19,35412055,Keaton,Staying at this location was incredibly easy.  I was coming from the West Coast so my flight got in late.  Shawn gave me easy instructions for a lockbox and I went straight up.  The neighborhood had easy access to public transit and there were helpful instructions laid out for WiFi etc in the bedroom.
"Shawn was incredibly helpful and friendly and it was a great stay.\"",,,,,
6248970,52872889,2015-11-02,9526463,Phil,"Host (Shawn):   Although a bit short in communications during confirmation process, in person he was rather pleasant and sociable."
Room/bathroom:   Quite adequate in setup.  The comforter felt worn out in the underside (where you feet meet the comforter underneath).  Floors in bathroom and room could use some cleaning (hair of different length and curliness abundant,3-4 bars of used soap from previous guests laying around in the bathroom reserved for Airbnb guests).,,,,
"Location:   Much farther than other neighborhoods but the Orange Line gets you \"\"home\"\" faster than other T lines (metro).  The apt bldg is between two T Stations (Jackson Sq to the North and Stony Brook to the south).  Couple day-time walks to the Jackson Sq station made me feel guarded about the environment.  I ended up taking long uber rides after dusk instead.  One uber driver warned me about \"\"a recent stabbing\"\" outside the housing project Bromley Park (Centre St & Chestnut)",which I walked by in order to reach the Jackson Sq T Station.   Maybe,"walking to the T station would've made me feel less guarded.  Or I could've (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)d \"\"crime maps Boston\"\" before booking.  But",there is always uber!,,
Bldg:   Room is on the 3d floor (no elevator).  Pack accordingly.,,,,,
Keys:   Apparently,the lock box containing the entry keys jammed easily.  Upon arrival,I couldn't open the box (so couldn't other guests,Shawn said).  Fortunately,Shawn was home for that night before leaving town.  Otherwise,I would've been homeless.
Neighborhood:  Not much to explore.  Beyond the immediate neighborhood,"students from nearby colleges make it more lively and safer.\"",,,,

The only downside is the location, which is 30 to 35 minutes away from downtown Boston and doesn't have much to offer on its own. But that's why this place is significantly less expensive than others in central locations. It's a 15 minutes walk to the train, and the neighborhood didn't feel particularly dangerous, although it's a little deserted at night. For someone who can deal with that, I fully recommend."
6248970,67694963,2016-03-30,23745258,Doruk,We had a very pleasant stay at Shawn's. We had no problem checking in and out. Our hosts were kind enough to provide maps and directions to the nearest subway station. Also unlike other guests we did not have any noise issues at night.

It was so great having a private bathroom during my stay.  And it was a short walk to the T station, which was really important to me since this was my main means of transportation while in the city.

The keys in the lock box worked just fine.  The stairs inside to the third floor was well lit with automatic lights and felt safe.,,,,,
If someone is looking for a minimalistic room for a good price and can navigate three flights of stairs,"then this would work well.  The owner was very helpful and accommodating.\"",,,,
6248970,79809809,2016-06-14,31878079,Steven,"The house is really nice. Shawn is a very friendly person. Sorry I didn't get to say goodbye. The location is good only 15 minutes away from downtown by T. Airport is only like 20 minutes away. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. Would definitely come back if I have a chance"
6248970,80647135,2016-06-19,51616586,Mitchell,"Great 1st experience with airbnb. Shawn was gracious, thoughtful, and available. The room was exactly as described."
6248970,82108001,2016-06-26,76817544,Emilie,"This was the very first time I have tried Airbnb and this was the perfect place to start. Shawn is an excellent host and very kind to his guests. The place is clean, air-conditioned in the summer and in a nice area. Everything you need is a few minutes walk away."
6248970,83622935,2016-07-03,30915343,Grace,"Great neighborhood to stay in. The airbnb was a 7 minute walk from either T station. The room was very comfortable, spacious, and clean. Having the private bathroom made it so I could come and go on my own schedule. The air conditioning was always on, which made it very comfortable particularly because of the warm weather during my stay. Thank you for the great stay!"
6248970,86471093,2016-07-16,72513078,Hannah,"Shawn was extremely welcoming and helpful!  There were maps ready for me at my arrival, and he was very good at giving privacy when needed but also being very friendly in the common areas."
6248970,89853082,2016-07-30,1560101,Colin,"It was a good place to stay. Shawn is a nice guy and quite accomodating. Having a private bathroom is nice and I would recommend the place to others. Cleanliness ~ 8/10 (not perfect, but pretty good for AirBnB standards)."
"Only issue: the room is a fairly dark once the sun goes down. \"",,,,,
6248970,91311723,2016-08-04,77188486,Yu,Shawn prepared everything well and clean and comfort! You should stay here! It's close the the orange T line (Jackson Square Station). Many shops nearby. Shawn is so nice!
6248970,92041681,2016-08-07,86000385,Aldo,"È stata la mia prima esperienza con Airbnb ed è stata positiva: Shawn é stato gentile e disponibile. La stanza é confortevole e pulita e si ha disposizione un bagno privato. L'appartamento è ubicato a pochi minuti a piedi dalla metropolitana che collega con il centro città e nella zona intorno la casa, ci sono ristoranti e supermarket .  Il quartiere è multienico e  offre una dimensione  più reale e meno turistica della città. Chi volesse visitare Boston, consiglio questa struttura."
6248970,93484572,2016-08-13,73913520,Nick,This was a very comfortable and affordable way to stay near the heart of Boston. Good access to the local train system. The accommodation was very clean and comfortable and Shawn was an excellent host.
6248970,94667810,2016-08-16,22450001,Sasha,"This is a great place to stay: the room is clean and comfortable, you have your own bathroom, and the metro station is only a 5min walk away. Shawn was very friendly and accommodating and made me feel welcome from the moment I walked in. I highly recommend this place."
6248970,95474052,2016-08-19,30313899,Chris,"The place is fantastic -- everything looked new and clean and I felt very comfortable (especially with the AC). I did not meet Shawn in person, but he was very responsive and checked with me several times to make sure everything was okay. The train station is only a short walk away, and I feel safe walking at night as there's a park nearby that's fairly crowded, and the street is very well-lit as well."
6248970,97477674,2016-08-27,23605954,Alex,"Shawn and Nik were very welcoming and have a very pleasant, clean home. The bed was comfortable, and the room was large with plenty of storage space. The private bathroom was also very nice. I'd happily stay with them again."
1529321,8118321,2013-10-16,8891281,Christoph,I can definitely recommend staying at Aris place and will consider it for future travels to Boston!
Really close to public transportation: 57 to downtown every 7min,takes 20-30min; 64 to MIT every 20min takes 30min; 66 to Harvard Square every 10min takes 15min,all stops less than 0.1mile.,,,
If I had questions Ari was always available and had immediate answers.,,,,,
The room had a heater which heated the room to your preferred temperature very quickly.,,,,,
Ari moved in the house shortly before my stay. He finished the kitchen mid of Oct and for future stays there might even be a living room available wich was still storage space in Oct.,,,,,
If it is important for you to have a curtain or blinds for the window,ask him,I am sure he will install some for you.,,,
The front door has a combination lock,so arrival time is flexible.,,,,
"Thank you Ari for the good time!\"",,,,,

1529321,8630860,2013-11-09,3230853,Hidefusa,"The room I stayed in this time was very cozy, clean, and spacious. I used the complimentary washer and drier for the first time, which helped out a lot. The nights are quiet and I got a lot of quality sleep."

I even met his friends and it was a very good time!,,,,,
"I recommend Ari for a perfect stay in Boston :)\"",,,,,
1529321,12121857,2014-04-23,8756244,Benjamin,"Fantastic host. Very friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and comfortable. The one downside was the water pressure (or lack thereof) in the 2nd floor shower, but certainly not a deal-breaker. Overall, a great host and a great stay. Would definitely book again."
1529321,12355617,2014-04-29,13937165,Asad,"Ari's place served my purpose exactly as I wanted to. For me the location was critical since I had to be in different places at weird times like 5:30 in the morning of 12:30 AM. Ari's house is located in a strategic place use public transport using busses 66,57 and of course green-line. The room was great as well."
1529321,12762183,2014-05-10,11631490,Zheming,"Air is a very nice guy and we had chat everyday. He's friendly and full of passion on hockey. I am pretty impressed by the small room that I booked. Bed is wide enough and warm enough. The house is big and free to go around, Ari saved a small layer for me in the fridge which is friendly. I love the location, there are many good restaurant nearby and also supermarket. The only flaw that I can tell is the bathroom is little bit small, but that's not a problem. Thank you Ari, for your Vodka, lol!"
1529321,13042288,2014-05-18,14285522,Ed,Ari was friendly and helpful. The room was  what I needed for my two night  Boston visit. The trolley to downtown and Fenway Park is a couple of blocks away and very convent. I would stay at Ari's house again. Thanks Ari
1529321,13070614,2014-05-19,556293,Justin,"This space was exactly what I needed for a one night stay. Right around the corner from my concert venue. Close to public transportation and several cool spots to eat. The room was simple and comfy. Ari offered me free roam of the house and wifi, but I wasn't there long enough to take advantage. Maybe next time ..."
1529321,13167974,2014-05-20,15490106,Mélissa,"The room was great, quiet and big"

There are many room in the house so you can get lost,,,,,

1529321,13295275,2014-05-24,13129917,Emily,Ari was so welcoming and helpful! Unfortunately I didn't have much time in Boston but I appreciated the clean and quiet room. Very close to yummy vegan restaurants and Boston University which was perfect for my trip.
"Thanks Ari!\"",,,,,
1529321,19117913,2014-09-07,7367757,Merletti,"Io ho passato con Ari tre mesi e mezzo e mi sono trovato benissimo, un'esperienza unica e indimenticabile dove ho conosciuto un sacco di persone fantastiche; Ari è una persona splendida disponibile e che ama aiutare e assistere i suoi ospiti, se avete bisogno di qualsiasi cosa lui si adopererà per aiutarvi. La casa è grande anche se a volte risulta un po' disordinata, la cucina spaziosa e attrezzatissima, i bagni sono solo due, ma non è un grosso problema dopo un po' ci si abitua. Il quartiere è ottimo per studenti e ragazzi che vogliano divertirsi soprattutto durante il fine settimana dove si anima tantissimo di feste per universitari e dove è possibile trovare un gran numero di ristoranti e locali per bere delle ottime birre e cocktail. La zona in cui è ubicata la casa è abbastanza vicina al centro  e alle zone universitarie, in ogni caso è ben servita da mezzi pubblici, inoltre se si va durante l'estate (come me) consiglio vivamente di noleggiare delle bici tramite Hubway che ha una stazione proprio di fronte a casa. Nel complesso un'esperienza che consiglio a tutti."
Hi lived with Ari for 3 months and it has really been a wonderful and unforgettable experience. I met a lot of nice people and Ari is a perfect landlord: he's always ready to help his hosts,you can ask him anything. The house is big (even if sometimes a bit messy),the kitchen is fully equipped,there are two bathrooms. The neighborhood is perfect for students and young people who want to have fun: there're always a lot of parties for students during the weekends,and there are a lot of bars and restaurants. The house is quite next to the city centre and the university area,the zone is well served by buses. If you're going to Boston during summer
1529321,20747476,2014-10-05,5039542,Mark,"Prior to booking, I contacted Ari with a few questions as I was looking for a month rental. He replied promptly, but on move-in day he forgot I was moving it. He was able to give me a quick tour over the phone though."
I saw Ari only a couple of times during my stay,which was fine with me. He has cleaning personnel coming in every now and then,so the place is clean and there are plenty of towels etc. Kitchen has all the appliances I needed.,,,
My room itself is very basic,but works if you are looking to be out most of the day. A small table would be a nice addition though. All in all,"good value for money - although I see the rates have gone up a little.\"",,,
1529321,21024083,2014-10-09,447897,Jan,"Ari's place is in a lively neighbourhood with lots of excellent bars, restaurants and concert venues. The space is nice and clean with a very comfy bed. Ari's communication was excellent, he was very helpful regarding things like parking and laundry at the house."

1529321,22980837,2014-11-19,19366227,David,"I didn't get to meet Ari as he was overseas but he was very helpful messaging me very thorough directions about my room. The room was a good size for one person and it was warm which was great. The location is really handy being a 60 second trip to food, and about 5 mins to the nearest T line tram. I was happy with my stay, if I'm in Boston again I'd consider his place again for sure."
1529321,23260082,2014-11-26,11023749,Candice,"Multi family home, is as described in info....quiet nice host....parking available a street over"
1529321,23561115,2014-12-04,3855696,Kelly,"A big cozy house in a safe, happening neighborhood. Though Ari was abroad,he has a great and efficient setup with his friend Marika nearby to address any concerns. There are several other guests in the house from around the world who were pleasant company. An amazingly comfortable situation for the price."
1529321,23932380,2014-12-14,12076875,Andrea,"Had a very good experience! Its in a great location, just by the 57 bus and about 10 min ride to kenmore square (fenway park). Everything was very clean and a lot of different products were available for use in the bathroom, its really convenient if you ever forget to bring something like toothpaste or shampoo! Lots of clean towels available too! The bed was really comfortable and freshly cleaned! Wifi included too! Overall experience 10/10!"
1529321,24060365,2014-12-18,16215760,Waleed,"Everything was great especially when you have people like Robert, Anka, Flavia, and Sofie. The bedroom was comfortable. I recommend you come and stay in this nice place. By the way the public transportation is very close, so for visitors I think this place is the best for you!"
1529321,24680496,2015-01-01,11069386,Valerie,"Great room in a really cool house. There are lots of restaurants, music venues and bars within walking distance. Great communication from the host and easy hassle- free check in. Parking on the street was easy to find even on New Years Eve."
1529321,24977998,2015-01-04,18999852,Yangsen,"The room was very comfortable. The neighborhood is energetic but quiet. There are some really good vegetarian restaurants just across the street! The whole house is clean as well and the host-- Ari is very considerate, even though he was not around, he was doing his best to take care of everything! Also, there's a bus stop across the street and the bus will take you to Harvard university about 15 minutes. I enjoyed my stay very much!"

1529321,26045030,2015-02-02,21406182,Carolina,Very good room and house! Enjoyed my stay!!
1529321,26878831,2015-02-21,18490193,Leon,"Ari´s house was a great place to stay in Boston. It is easy to get to Harvard university from there. There is a bus-stop just around the corner. The house is spacious, and light. It has 2 bathrooms and there is space to put your stuff and hang towels. Wifi is good. The neighborhood is a very nice quiet blend of single family and multi-family residences along with some small commercial spaces and restaurants. I would definitely recommend this place!"

1529321,28955816,2015-04-01,5152671,Dave,"If you're looking for a deal in Boston, Ari's house provides a great option. The room is only $65 a night, which was on the lower end of what I was able to find while staying in Boston / Cambridge. Ari was very communicative leading up to the checkin, and I had no problem checking into the listing."
That being said,"I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. Airbnb's core brand identity is to allow travelers to \"\"belong anywhere.\"\" I can't say that I felt like I belonged very much at Ari's. Ari is out of the country",and as far as I can tell has been for awhile. It seems like he rents out about 7 rooms at a time. The entire house is quite bare and unlived in,and seems a bit rundown,to be honest. It isn't possible to lock the doors to the rooms,so one might feel uncomfortable leaving valuables around. There are self-serve racks of towels and bedding for guests to use throughout the duration of their stay. Overall
My room itself was just okay. The bed was a mattress on top of a bedspring and/or pallet,but there was no headboard. The bed would roll around on the floor as I lay down to sleep. There was a small desk with a chair,and upon putting my coat on the chair,the chair fell apart. The room was quite minimal,"and the room that I was \"\"assigned\"\" to stay in was actually not the room pictured in the page for this listing.",
All of this being said,the location of the place is great - you're right in Allston,and lots of cool landmarks are nearby it. It is also relatively easy to access Cambridge and get to Harvard,although MIT is quite far away.,,
Overall,if you're looking for a cheap place with the essentials,where you're staying in an unkept house with a bunch of strangers,Ari's might hit the spot,"but it is not the right place to stay if you're looking for a \"\"communal\"\" experience.\"",
1529321,29703859,2015-04-11,30438842,Andy,"Being my first AirBnB experience, I was not sure what to expect but it turned out to be a great experience overall. Ari was a great host and made sure I was comfortable with the stay.  Though he was out of the country during my visit, he offered excellent instructions and connected me with a local contact who would be of assistance if I needed anything during my stay.  Though it was a older house, I didn't experience any discomfort or access issues.  I'd recommend Ari's den any day and I look forward to staying at his place during my next visit to Boston."
1529321,29870758,2015-04-13,466290,Adrien,The space was itself was very comfortable but there were a few disappointments that I need to flag.
Upon our arrival,neither Ari nor Marika was there to greet us -- not the end of the world,but a little bizarre being greeted by a (seemingly)  empty house.,,,
Most notably,the lock to the room was broken despite  my specific request for confirmation that it worked beforeI booked the space.,,,,
While Ari had extenuating circumstances that made it impossible for me to get in touch with him,Marika -- the point of contact that Ari provided -- was also inaccessible until many hours later. That said,my boyfriend and I spent two hours jimmying the lock shut.,,,
Unfortunately,we didn't feel safe the rest of the trip -- the lack of any concrete contact was unsettling and no locksmith ever came to fix the door,despite Marika's guarantee the situation would rectified.,,,
As mentioned,"the space itself was great but really wish we weren't so mislead about the lock situation. \"",,,,
1529321,30439612,2015-04-22,24336106,Janez,"I ran the Boston Marathon 2015 and this was my first time I booked the room over Airbnp. Ari's house is on a great location, close to the bus station and many shops, restaurants and cafes. It is a pretty quiet area with many universities around and a lot of students live around. Ari was a great host and I enjoyed in his house. If I ran the Boston Marathon next year, I will definitely stay here again because this is the best location and the best accommodation in Boston which I can get for this price."
1529321,30589118,2015-04-24,3465190,Grant,"Location is awesome, easability was great with not needing a key just a security combination to hisp orperty, bed was very comfortable and not too small. Only concern was the bedroom did not have a bathroom on the floor but not a major concern. A great place and highly recommend."
1529321,30654180,2015-04-25,23350108,Zeljka,"I stayed at Ari's for two nights and everything was perfect. I actually did not meet Ari, I met his mum, who was super kind and helpful, but Ari emailed me to make sure everything was OK. The room was exactly the same as described, it was very clean, the bed is super-comfy, the kitchen has all you could possibly need, I loved everything about Ari's place! Also, the location is great, it's a very quiet neighborhood, but it has all you need! The Walgreens is just across the street, as well as the coffee shop and some cute restaurants. The bus station to Harvard Square is just steps away from Ari's house. I highly recommend Ari's place to anyone coming to Boston/Cambridge and I will most definitely stay with Ari on my next visit."
1529321,30743765,2015-04-26,23350108,Zeljka,"I loved everything about Ari's place! His house is in a very convenient location, you can easily catch a bus to take you to any part of Boston you want. I even used the public transportation from the airport to his place. The room was very clean and cozy, as well as the rest of the house. Ari himself was very welcoming and accurate. All in all, staying in his house was a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend Ari's place to anyone visiting Boston."

Clean,"calm and easy to find.\"",,,,
1529321,31846940,2015-05-10,32505992,Frank,"My wife and I enjoyed staying at Ari's place.  We only stayed for 1 night and were out most of the time.  The private room was clean and presented as described.  We had full access to the bathroom on the second floor and the kitchen on the first floor.  It's located on a quiet street but still close to the bustle of Allston at night.  So, it can be a little noisy on the weekend but we were still able to sleep just fine.  Parking can be a little tough in the area - just have to look.  The area was perfect - plenty of great food all around, everything was within walking distance - restaurants, grocery, coffee, etc etc.  Allston has some of the best ethnic eateries in the Boston area.  The area is very diverse and all of our encounters were friendly! Ari's communication was amazing and he was more than helpful."
1529321,32043443,2015-05-12,24971534,Jason,"I only stayed for a night but the room was great! Well furnished and isolated from the other rooms so noise wasn't a problem. There was even a laundry hamper. Ari was abroad, but he gave me all the directions I needed. The neighborhood seemed very safe. I would recommend the place."
1529321,32216803,2015-05-15,30877683,Jonathan,Nice neighborhood with a lot of local life and restaurants. Check in was simple and I was never bothered.

1529321,32913733,2015-05-23,32106982,Elif,"Ari's home was in central of the Boston. You can go everywhere with bus or train. And it is in trustable area. You feel yourself in your home. Although Ari is not at home, he always answer your e mail immidiately. He has very good relationship. Everything was great."
1529321,33181731,2015-05-25,13060139,Judy,"Ari was very quick to reply, and always very hospitable. I ended up having to cancel at the last minute, but he was gracious about everything. I would definitely book him again when I'm planning a visit to Boston."
1529321,33764839,2015-06-01,25479799,Ran-E,"I stayed for 7 nights at Ari's house. It is quite spacious and conveniently  located during the bus station. There are 6 rooms and i stayed on the 3 rd floor. Because Ari was abroad, it was hard sometimes to communicate with him especially because the wireless connection in my room was not always good but when i had a question he was always friendly and accommodating. So overall i enjoyed very much my stay"
1529321,34235017,2015-06-06,13242862,Allen,"Great place to stay. Easy to get in and out. Clean, prepared. Close to Walgreens, CVS, and eateries. Parking at night available only one block away by the school."
1529321,34897942,2015-06-13,31374583,Luciane,Ari is a great host. That's very considerate about location questions and home facilities. I recommend him to all users of Airbnb.
1529321,35012093,2015-06-14,31046420,Brad,"\"While \"\"Best private room in Boston\"\" might be a bit of an exaggeration"
Ari responded quickly to communication and,while we didn't get to meet him because he was out of town,he was genuinely interested in making sure things went smoothly and we had what we needed.,,,
For the price,"this is a good place in a nice part of town with easy access to just about any other part of Boston that interests you.  Give it a try.\"",,,,
1529321,36817457,2015-07-01,35392534,Milind,Ari's place was very nice. He could be there to greet but he had made sure I had detailed instructions and access to the house. House itself was very nice and clean. Street parking was a problem. But then that is true for whole of Allston.
1529321,43720575,2015-08-21,38049833,Veronica,Ari made check in simple and easy; the bed was also super comfortable and the room was clean. It was a nice location surrounded by restaurants and places for dessert.

1529321,60352863,2016-01-22,14756571,Michael,Everything was fine. The host was out working but he left me everything I needed..
1529321,60510075,2016-01-24,53662117,Peter,Ari was a great host. He was on top of everything. There wasn't anything that i need to worry about as he handled everything that needed to be dealt with beforehand. Everything necessary was informed and his responses to my questions via messages were always super prompt.
The room was nice too. It was well equipped with a bed,drawer,lamp,and even a fridge. The cleaning lady was on deck for the entire unit so the facility was kept cleaned and always stocked. The two shared bathrooms in the entire building were great too.  I liked using the first floor one but both were pleasantly maintained. Every room was assigned a key so security wasn't an issue either. The front door had an automatic lock that required a code to get in. So you just had to hold onto your room key which made it a light travel.,,
I stayed here on january,and outside temperature was 25 ~ 30 degrees. But the room was quite warm/not cold at all because the central heating was well activated. Coming from California,i was worried i would die in my sleep without extra blankets or anything. But i slept with the blanket that was there and it was perfectly fine.,,,
Overall,i had a pleasant stay in my cozy room. I highly recommend the place,and i highly recommend Ari as a responsible,timely,"and personable host. \"",
1529321,61245390,2016-02-01,2885827,Jose,"Ari as usual did a great job. The place looked just like in the pictures and it was clean. There were no worries about it being cold in winter because not only was there central heating, there was also a space heater in case you needed it."

1529321,64076364,2016-02-29,1109332,Mauro,"Ari is a very caring host. His house is quite comfortable, equipped with a number of perks. I spent almost one month there and I cannot complain at all, about common spaces, privacy, guests, etc. The room was a little small, still fine for a person."
1529321,64309313,2016-03-02,19163166,Elias,Ari was a great host. The communication was very easy and everything was well organized. The room is cozy and comfortable. Kitchen was also well equipped and clean. Accommodation is absolutely recommendable.
1529321,68318703,2016-04-04,53412700,Ana Luiza,Ari is an excellent hostess! Although I didn´t have the chance to meet him He was always very supportive and available! The room is just like the picture and it is very comfortable and cozy. The neighborhood is also very nice and near from public transportation.  I strongly recommend Ari´s place!
1529321,68666096,2016-04-06,65339080,Myron,"The house is in a great location, and the host responses very quickly with detailed info, so it's really easy to enjoy the room with no hassle."
1529321,68817086,2016-04-06,6626885,Jeannie,Very easy stay. Ari gave me all the information I needed to get into the house even though he wasn't in town while I stayed. The room is just as pictured.
1529321,68848228,2016-04-07,49576956,Rick Andrew,"Ari wasn't around when I was there, but he provided detailed instructions on how to get to his location and how to get into the house. Was a great place to stay for a last minute need."
1529321,68911435,2016-04-07,39441871,Doron,"As always, my experience was great! Clean, tidy room, excellent for a night stay for a lecturer in town!"

1529321,69776313,2016-04-13,57209446,Joe,"Ari accepted my request almost immediately, the house is in a nice neighborhood near colleges and universities. The room was spacious and had all the accommodations I needed. Public transit is right outside and easy to find. I would definitely book this room again. Thanks Ari."
1529321,69874656,2016-04-14,39441871,Doron,"Excellent visit, I'm a regular sleeper at Ari's and will come back whenever I'll be in Boston."
1529321,70665711,2016-04-19,10261288,Pascal,Ari is awesome and a very detailed communicator!! We didn't have a chance to meet him but he was always making sure that we had everything we needed via text.
The place was great and just around the corner from the bus stop.  This was our first trip to Boston and there were so many great local restaurants and cafes to choose from within walking distance.,,,,,
"Definitely would recommend Ari's place to anyone and would stay there again!!\"",,,,,
1529321,71034245,2016-04-23,7939936,Olivia,"While I didn't meet Ari in person, I was given clear instructions on how to check in, and he was very attentive via message any time I needed anything. The room itself is small, but surprisingly quaint and cosy. Even in the high 70's, the window lets in a cool breeze - it's very nice! You have all amenities one needs in your room, the bathroom, or the kitchen. Plus, it's a great neighborhood near lots of public transit. Absolutely fantastic stay with everything I needed!"
1529321,71723565,2016-04-28,15556513,Marine,"Ari was a great host. He was abroad during my stay but always replied to my messages and questions and made sure we had access to everything we needed. Access to the place was easy, the house was clean and quiet and the room was the same as on the pictures. Thanks Ari!"
1529321,71877319,2016-04-29,68541355,Srinath,House was as described. Ari was very helpful and in constant touch. Good host.
1529321,72107962,2016-05-01,66642946,Luz,Such a wonderful host! Everything was well explained and took the time to answer questions about the area. We would for sure stay here again the future!
1529321,72757721,2016-05-04,66041369,Nouchie,"Ari is so easy to communicate with and does a great job as host. The rooms were spacious, had heaters, good storage, mirrors, and lock and keys provided. I had a great experience at his place and will definitely book again if I'm in Boston."
1529321,73377826,2016-05-08,67108810,Mona,"The stay at Ari's place was nice. The listing was as described and clean. The neighborhood is safe as well. The next time I visit Boston, I will live here again. :)"

1529321,74610723,2016-05-16,70841028,Vipasan,Ari was very helpful and quick to respond back with any queries and very flexible with my requests. The stay was comfortable and everything went smooth. The location was even perfect with lots of eating places near by and bars at walking distance if you want to grab that drink.
1529321,75287872,2016-05-20,28758014,Dalia,"Although I didn’t have the opportunity to meet Ari, he was a great host. He replied to my emails immediately and was very kind. The location of this place is great and the room was clean and nice."
1529321,75784180,2016-05-23,13412085,Andy,Excellent from arrival to departure. Good location and nice room. Very prompt correspondence.
1529321,76987832,2016-05-30,71461209,Maurice,"We never saw Ari during our 4 Night stay; however, he made sure we had everything we needed when requested. His response time was almost immediate every time. The listing was exactly as described. We enjoyed the option of two full bathrooms. This came in handy when all of the rooms started to book up on the back end of the week. The only add, would be to mention that there isn't any central A/C. Ari made sure we had enough fans to suffice, but the heat was unbearable at times for my wife. Luckily we're from Florida, so we weren't as phased as I think others would be."
As far as the location,A++++. There were plenty of restaurants,bars and convenience stores in very short walking distance. There was even a really good barber shop at the corner. We made frequent Lyft trips to the Cambridge,Somerville and Back Bay. All were quick rides and under $10. Our other option was the Hubway Bike Station,which located in front of the house (NW). Bike prices were very reasonable.,
The neighborhood was quiet and very diverse. I would say that it comes alive more during the daytime than at night,but the nightlife was still good. We took two night tours (1Drunken and 1 Sober) to Lone Star Taco. The food was A+ on both trips.,,,,
In spite of the heat,we would return to stay here again. We would make sure we have ample A/C next time around. But then again,you’re visiting to see the city and not the room. Sacrifice A/C for the experience of getting immersed in to what Boston has to offer.,,,

1529321,80948561,2016-06-20,14688437,Aimee,"We stayed at Ari's house for 6 nights. It was comfortable and clean. Note that there are 5 or 6 other bedrooms rented, and I think they might all share the 2 bathrooms - we did have to wait for showers and toilets on several occasions. We did not meet Ari during our stay, however he was very responsive to emails."

1529321,81595238,2016-06-24,6817840,Matthieu,It is basically a one star hotel without anyone to welcome guests.  Otherwise the room looks clean and ari was responsive (by email only)
1529321,82007438,2016-06-26,71864856,Daniel,THE BEST ROOM I HAVE EXPERIENCED! Here is why you should book it:
1. Location. Next to all the popular bars in Allston,yet also located in a quiet alcove street.,,,,
2. Independent. You won't be bothered with interacting with anyone during your visit. There is a clever passcode to enter the building and your room gets its own key.,,,,,

1529321,83073962,2016-07-01,36236246,Marianne,"Ari was very communicative and helpful, all the information he sent was detailed and he was quick to respond to any questions. Stayed for 1 night, room had an ac which was nice in the 90f heat. Room was in a quiet, professional household so no worry about not getting a good night's sleep. Not too far from city center, I had a car and was able to find parking within a 5 minute walk."
1529321,83749409,2016-07-04,66825818,Jasmine,"This is a very nice room you can stay,you can live like your home,can feel freedom and relax,do everything you want. Ari is so nice,he can answer all your questions."
1529321,84042713,2016-07-05,44301560,Eric,"I had a great experience staying at Ari's place. The building is centrally located and easy to find, yet on a quiet side street. Ari was very responsive and provided everything needed for a comfortable stay. I loved that the room had air conditioning and a mini fridge. I'll definitely look to see if Ari has a room available the next time in town."
1529321,85151861,2016-07-10,2065858,Alejandro,"I stay in Ari's place for 5 days in July. The house has everything you need to be confortable, clean and very quite. The house have several guest rooms. I briefly meet some of the other guests (very nice people), but I was most of the time outside the house. I did not meet Ari since he was away, but the communication before and during my stay was great. He was alway available to answer any question. Check in and check out was flexible and easy. The house is close to buses and train public transport, but I cannot comment more since I used Hubway (bike sharing system in Boston). There is a hubway station 30 metres form the house so it was very convenient to move around (highly recommended). The surrounding area of the house is nice with plenty of restaurants and grocery shops. I would stay in Ari's house again if I have the chance to come back to Boston."
1529321,85826371,2016-07-13,42169165,Will,"This is a clean and comfortable basic place to stay (comfortable bedroom, useful common space), with a very positive ambiance. The host (Ari) is great at communication before and during the stay. The location works well: close to transit, restaurants, and bars, within a 45 minute walk of Harvard square.  I believe I saw a public bicycle rental station close bay also (though may be getting that wrong, so you would need to check)."
Be clear about the house and location: This is not a fancy B&B-type residence in a fancy location. It is a basic place to stay with clean,comfortable bedrooms & shared bathrooms,as well as substantial common space (kitchen and living room) in an older neighbourhood that is in early stages of gentrification.  Based on that context,"it offers great value.\"",,
1529321,86955069,2016-07-18,52058112,Ashley,"Although we never met Ari, he still his best to make sure the place was comfortable and we had everything we needed. The room was cute and the house was clean. It was easy to get to the green line or just walk around allston. Would definitely stay again!"

1529321,88488795,2016-07-24,80375374,Alannah,"Overall I had a relatively pleasant stay with Ari. He was overseas for the duration of my stay (and possibly further back from the time I booked the room) but he was very clear on how to get in, what was available to me, etc.  His house is quite a trek from downtown but I enjoy figuring out and riding public transit. Plus I needed to sacrifice convenience for cost."
I did have one hiccup where the wrong key was left for my room and I was locked out for a while. In retrospect Ari did not take long to get back to me with a solution but by the time he did I had gone into panic mode and had a locksmith on the way.,,,,,
My room was on the top floor of 3 stories and was just as pictured. I had my own mini fridge,which was an unexpected nice touch. Otherwise it was a bed,nightstand,dresser,mirror,and a small chair. The house is old but clean and in a neighborhood I feel is still in its up-and-coming stages. I never felt unsafe anywhere though
1529321,89651716,2016-07-29,61941032,Julianne,Ari was an EXCELENT host. He was overseas but still managed to be available for any questions. I have no complaints!

1529321,91456434,2016-08-05,85690312,Breia,"Ari made me feel so incredibly welcome. Anything that I needed he took care of right away.  I needed to change rooms the next morning, and so I needed a place to store my luggage.  I sent him a text message, and he responded immediately with a solution.  I can't say enough positive things about him.  He is a wonderful host that will go above and beyond to meet your needs.  The room was very clean, and it was also very quiet.  I would definitely stay at this location again."

The room is as described and has a fridge and rolling chair. The cleaning lady arrived promptly afterward after we told the host and cleaned the room. The bathrooms were somewhat clean but had a very bad smell so didn't feel comfortable when using. The location is set up with other rooms that get rented out I suppose and it didn't feel homey. It felt like a bunch a random furniture placed in a space I guess for convenience."

9858437,67250188,2016-03-27,60438850,Yuan,She included maps and an apple TV with Netflix ready for viewing. The neighborhood was pretty decent and not too bad. It was pretty close to the airport and so that helped. The rooms  were nicely sized.

9858437,70124384,2016-04-16,1359907,Alex,No where on the AirBNB description does it say that this is across the street from a landfill and prison. My girlfriend was afraid to even enter the apartment. We had to leave early because she was so uncomfortable and felt so unsafe.
9858437,70657236,2016-04-19,40539729,Colleen,"Ana was very kind and helpful.  The apartment is not located in a very nice neighborhood but the apartment itself was very up to date and clean.  I think it is imporant for people to know that the area where the apartment is located is just okay.  The other thing I would note is the beds are not very comfortable.  They are IKEA style beds, so they are okay.  If you are expecting good quality beds then this is not the place for you.  Also if you don't have a car it can be a bit more complicated if you have nowhere to store your luggage.  It was a little diffiuclt for us on Saturday becuase our flight arrived early and we had no where to store our luggage until we could check in at 2:30pm."

There are fabulous local restaurant s within walking distance such as Spinelli's, a fantastic Italian catering business where you can pick up amazing Italian food and take it home.  Also, it is worth going to El Chalan, a fabulous Peruvian roasted chicken place where it is best to take food home if you are not up for being around folks who do not speak English.  East Boston is a  wonderful neighborhood with many diverse people and businesses as well as wonderful parks with stunning ocean front views of Boston.  The place is a steal at this price and worth every last penny."

Very easy to find and convenient to freeway. We got to Boston really early in the morning so we didn't have any parking issue. We got to the apartment and got the keys. we had a little hard time using the key to the deadbolt,it took a few minutes to get it open. i'm sure this is an easy fix. When we got in,the place is clean especially the kitchen. The bedrooms are cozy,clean and got everything you need. She even left us a couple of milk in the fridge. The place seems like newly renovated and kept clean. You have a TV and Netflix in the living room. Wi-Fi is also provided so that was nice.,,
"The only thing I would mention is  the parking situation especially if you are coming home late and again the key to the deadbolt. I would definitely stay again if ever in the Boston area. Overall very nice experience and would not hesitate to recommend to friends.\"",,,,,
9858437,75234480,2016-05-20,27376602,Faizan,"Loved the place and enjoyed my stay. Bunch of dining places around as well, so late night meals were not a problem at all!"
9858437,75716889,2016-05-22,45094928,Sara,Ana was very accommodating! She helped us with a ride from the airport. The apartment was exactly as it is in the pictures. We were very comfortable.
9858437,76233836,2016-05-25,23107598,Vikki,"Ana was very helpful and met us at the apartment to show us around. The walk from the nearest T stop is less than 5 minutes and it was only a 15 minute walk from the airport T stop so perfect. The apartment had everything you needed and I had no issue with the neighbourhood. The people on the street always greeted me as I walked by and there was no noise at night. Nice that there was milk, eggs and muffins in the fridge on arrival. No issues with this property at all. Thank you."
9858437,76690628,2016-05-29,12240925,Brandon,"Ana provided food, internet, apple tv with netflix,and clean towels and linen."
9858437,79626807,2016-06-13,10489117,Rusulenni,Ana is super quick with resposes and answering any questions. The apartment looks exactly as pictured and sooo close to the airport ($8 uber) which was perfect. Tons of nearby restaurants which was also great. There was food in the fridge and the kitchen had everything we needed. Thanks for a great Stay Ana!
9858437,82526952,2016-06-28,210797,Gabriella,"We LOVED our stay at Ana's in Boston! The apartment is really large and well laid out and easily fit us. The place has recently been remodeled and everything feels fresh and new. Ana was great as a host and helped us out with our questions about what to do locally. The apartment is just a 5 min walk to the T subway system which we took advantage of everyday to get to Boston for sight seeing. Though the neighborhood may not look like much on first glance, it's actually a great place. There is a fantastic Peruvian restaurant right up the road that is always full with locals. The apartment is a close walk to a nice park and the river. We will definitely be staying at Ana's next time we go to Boston. It's affordable, safe and close enough to downtown Boston."
9858437,84135120,2016-07-05,59546411,Davis,I enjoyed staying at Ana's place. The apartment was beautiful and she was very accommodating as a host. She left food in the fridge just in case you're hungry.
Coming from California,I had a difficult time adjusting to the humidity. I had an incredibly difficult time breathing the first night in the apartment. After becoming accumulated with Boston's atmosphere the apartment became comforting.,,,,
Ana did say she will be installing an Air Conditioner so that problem will be resolved for the next guest.,,,,,
The neighborhood in east boston was friendly and their local cuisines were good. If you wanted to travel around Boston,the metro is near by. Make sure you buy the weekly pass if you're a explorer,it's highly worth it. I took the train and bus 20+ times. I had a great time here in Boston.,,,
"I would highly recommend Ana's place for interested parties. \"",,,,,
9858437,85171445,2016-07-10,21761806,Jim,"We had some confusion at first with checking in, but once we got that straightened out, everything else was fine.  This is a working class neighborhood with limited parking, unless you have a resident permit."
9858437,87051673,2016-07-18,9097705,Adriana,"Our stay at Ana's house was nice. Her place is in a convenient location to the airport which made for a cheap Uber ride (less than $10). It is very walkable to a lot of restaurants and mini mart stores. We ate at this amazing Irish Pub on Bennington Street; Kelley Square Pub. It was very Cheers like, everyone was friendly. We went to the park across the street one night and walked to the lookout over the Harbor, which was a nice walk and super close if you just wanna get out of the house. We didnt use the TV at all, the living room was hot! There is no central A/C. It didnt bother us much for sleeping, as the rooms had window units, but it didnt cool the rest of the house much. If this place had central AC and perhaps a TV in the bedrooms that would be a huge bonus, but we were out and about so it wasnt a big deal. The house is super close to the train station and it costs $12 for an all day pass to get around...that was nice and made it super easy to get around. Overall, we enjoyed the stay and it was a great deal for a very nice condo. Ana was very responsive and made sure we had what we needed. Thank you for having us, Ana."
9858437,88862354,2016-07-25,8894016,Katrinna,"The apartment was close to the Wood Island station, convenient to Downtown, Revere Beach and other shops and stores. The apartment is nicely updated and helps to be on the first floor! Thanks!"
9858437,89695151,2016-07-29,72777666,John,"I don't have too add that others haven't said. Great little place, nice park nearby, easy walk to subway. We enjoyed our stay and Ana was helpful and responsive when we had questions."
9858437,95374055,2016-08-19,19464333,Eric,"Ana est à notre entière disposition. L'appartement est effectivement cosy avec 2 chambres. Il est excentré du centre ville, il faut une voiture et est situé dans un quartier collant l'aéroport international. Il y a effectivement une télévision mais pas cablée, juste avec une Apple TV"
9858437,98351249,2016-08-30,82118180,Paula,"I sensed that Ana was very concerned for our well being and comfort. She left food for us and corresponded very quickly to our questions and concerns. At first the neighborhood looked a bit 'rundown', but it was safe and the people very friendly. Excellant restaurnats just a block or 2 away and always well attended."
1529393,12238902,2014-04-27,12485319,Victor,Great neighborhood and easy access to public transportation. The host was easy going and very good communicator.  Good experience.

This is a very nice apartment near the blue and red line station. Very central to everything in Boston. Perfect to visit. Very good experience!"
1529393,24441961,2014-12-28,2846956,Tom,Had a great stay for Xmas in Boston. A fantastic location and the place was great. Thank you

1529393,31973549,2015-05-12,22223525,Pietro,Tony was a wonderful host. Place was clean and organized. Made getting in and out a breeze. Highly recommend if looking for a convenient beacon hill apt.
1529393,32508093,2015-05-19,5884167,Carol,"The apartment was filthy upon arrival and pictures on website were not indicative of what we saw. Only 1 towel in bathroom for 2 people. We had to borrow towels, etc. from family nearby, due to lack of basic amenities. Host was difficult to communicate with in a timely fashion and made no effort to resolve issues during our stay, but did receive partial refund after several requests. Family member even had to go to hosts' jobsite to  get keys after several texts. Would never recommend."
1529393,32978050,2015-05-24,29258371,Julie,"Had a great stay. Very central location. Tony was moving out, so we had the place all to ourselves and the space was mostly empty, but we didn't mind as we were out for most of the day."
Tony was a lovely host,"he recommended us places to visit/eat in the city and checked up on how we were going mid stay. Very much appreciated! Would recommend this place to other visitors.\"",,,,

4278067,22046500,2014-10-28,12990654,Eleanor,"Apartment was very neat and clean. We arrived a little later then planned due to some traffic, and someone was there to meet us and tell us about the apartment. It was in a very cute neighborhood, I was there with my young daughter and I felt very safe in the apartment and throughout the neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again."
4278067,22687211,2014-11-11,13787213,Anton,"We were mostly communicating to a friend of the host that then put us in contact with a neighbor that met us outside the door and showed us the room. This however worked out very well. Room was nice and clean! We stayed 4 persons here, so two of us had to use a fold-out sofa of medium standard. The location is quiet, it is primarily residential so if you are heading to restaurants/bars/shops you will have to walk for a little bit. We thought this was actually a bit pricey in relation to the location and standard of the beds, but then again this is maybe the average level of Boston."
4278067,25822907,2015-01-26,26303043,Simon,A wonderful little apartment in a beautiful part of Boston.  Would highly recommend for anyone looking to get away to Boston.
4278067,26430178,2015-02-12,1420902,Sree,"My parents stayed at Glenn's apartment while visiting - it was exactly has described, very clean and cozy. It's a great neighborhood and Glenn was very accommodating. My parents will definitely stay here again on their next visit."
4278067,26510921,2015-02-14,27533702,Ellie,We had a lovely time staying here. It was in a nice location and within walking distance of all the activities that we wanted to partake in. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by Kevin and given the lay of the land. Much to our surprise we had been moved from the first floor to the second floor where we had a beautiful outlook of the city of Boston. The apartment itself was perfect. We could not have asked for a better experience.
4278067,26662373,2015-02-16,27554140,Max,"Our experience was excellent. Glenn offered a bigger apartment when we talked and it was exactly what we needed and even better tan expected. Clean, organized and very nicely decorated. Everything in order and exactly as described. But that was not all, the apartment was perfect, but Glenn went beyond that, we were in Boston in the middle of a snow storm and we was always worried about us and even offered help and made recommendations, a great host. We strongly recommend the apartment and our opinion is even better about Glenn as a host."
4278067,31373668,2015-05-04,12515861,Kim,"We were 4 girls, we arrived late at night and there was someone to welcome us. The studio was very clean, as well as the bathroom and the bedding and the kitchen has all you need. The murphy bed was comfortable. Since we were there for a week end, there was enough room for all of us. If you have a car, there's not many places to park without paying, but there's a garage right beside the subway station, it was 35$ per day."
It's well located,the area is quite pleasant and beautiful. It's only a 10 min. walk to the nearest subway station but there are many bus route closer.,,,,
"I would definitively suggest this place to anyone.\"",,,,,

It was quiet and didn't hear others in the building.  The area around the apartment was nice.  Had restaurants within walking distance, a Starbucks a couple of blocks away, and a laid back atmosphere.  The T station to go many places was only 3 blocks away.  I really liked the location and was close to everything.  The apartment was nice and I would stay in it again!  Found a gem!"
4278067,38421089,2015-07-15,1366715,Kimberly,"Had a wonderful stay in South End with my husband and 4mo old. We stayed in the ground floor apt which was well stocked with kitchen items, extra towels, linens, pillows and even a hairdryer. The apt was beyond clean and the Murphy bed was incredibly comfortable. The building is in a great location and is fairly quiet. Our host was accommodating with check in times, was responsive and even offered a porta crib for the baby. Will definitely stay again."

4278067,43570688,2015-08-20,12795171,João,We had a great time at the apartment (me and my family).
First we were very well received by Kevin,who was waiting for us on the door steps. Inside he gave us a very complete tour of everything and left us with a very helpful guide containing restaurants,supermarkets,useful phone numbers,among other things. There were also free maps of Boston. Kevin was always around on the next days,doing other stuff
The apartment was great,exactly like in the photos,very clean and the kitchen was very well equipped,big stove,toaster,blender
The neighbourhood seamed very friendly and safe. Also very complete with restaurants,hairdressers,grossers and other shops. We walked around day and night,went to the supermarket that was open until 10pm. Overall a great experience,"and I would definitely stay there again.\"",

Samantha wasn't around, but her roommates were friendly and happy to share their living space with me. The neighborhood is kind of in the middle of Northeastern, Symphony, Boylston St., and Fenway, which makes getting anywhere easy. It seems like the neighborhood is mostly inhabited by Northeastern students, which also made it a perfect fit for me."

She communicated as needed, but otherwise left you to rest or enjoy the prace and quiet og her home. The occasional piano lesson was a welcomed distraction.  I have already booked my next stay!"
1178371,28959987,2015-04-01,29554589,Moses,"This is my first time using airbnb for reservations, and I can confidently say my first choice of 45 Wellesley Park on the Historical Gas Light Street in Dorchester (Boston, MA) was the best! Victoria and Tim are excellent hosts. As a guest in their house, you have your free access to facilities in the home, and you enjoy total privacy to go about your activities. And you have access to the house every time, so you can go out and come in as you like; the hosts don't interfere with you in any way. As a plus, there is direct access to shopping facilities, and you can get on the train/bus easily to visit any part of Boston."
Victoria answered all my questions to my satisfaction,even before I arrived in Boston,and she drove me to the airport for free!,,,
"I'm definitely staying with them any time I visit Boston. \"",,,,,

Victoria's house is a great place to stay,"located near subway station that offers you the suburb tranquility and the quick accessibility to the Boston downtown.\"",,,,
1178371,29936919,2015-04-14,29835451,Brittany,This was my first Airbnb experience and it was really great. Three minute walk to the T and a 20 minute ride into Boston - super easy. I stayed in R1 - which is perfect for single travelers. Victoria responds very quickly and provides information to make your stay in Boston nice and lovely.
You have free range of kitchen use and fridge storage - and going in and out of the house. There's complementary tea and coffee and a few small family grocery stores 10 minutes away from the house,walking. The bathroom is shared,which can be a problem if there are others staying with you and they beat you in there,but usually it's not too bad.,,
Overall a really clean place but the surrounding city was a bit sketchy for a single traveler,especially at night so Uber if you're coming back late!,,,,
"You won't regret staying here! \"",,,,,
1178371,30316452,2015-04-20,29599817,Damon,"I had a delightful stay at Victoria's home over a weekend this April.  What I loved most about our stay included access to the T (subway) which was a 3 minute walk away, privacy and access to the private bath and kitchen and also the ease in which we came and go as we pleased."
The area is a very well lit historic street and there are numerous grocery shopping opportunities nearby.  I took advantage of a local barber service,cleaning service for my clothes and also a local bar with excellent food - The Blarney Stone - all within walking distance.,,,,
"Victoria does teach piano on the same floor but it never interrupted sleep nor anything else that I needed to do while there.  Access to the is close as I've mentioned so hearing the T go by can perhaps bother some very light sleepers but this shouldn't impact your stay.\"",,,,,
1178371,30455257,2015-04-22,28847247,Chiwei,"Since the house has been just renovated, everything is new and comfortable. Especially the bathroom is so roomy and clean. The house is located in a lovely area with many beautiful houses and an adorable small park around. There are various kinds of restaurants with adequate price in this area. You can also find grocery stores and cleaners in walking distance. Talking about traffic, the house is so close to the Shawmut T station with which you can easily reach downtown in only 20 minutes. Victoria and Tim are a lovely couple who are so nice to guests. Victoria even made delicious cheesecakes for all guests! In conclusion, I strongly recommend Victoria's house. If someday I visit Boston again, I will stay there definitely."
Victoria的房子才剛翻修完,裡面的設施很新而且很舒適,尤其是浴室很大很乾淨,床也讓我睡得很好。附近的社區環境優美,有許多漂亮房子還有一個小巧卻綠意盎然的公園就在家門前,街上的gas light更添幾分古典美。附近有各種餐廳

1178371,31597174,2015-05-07,2541875,Steve,The facilities are great...our own apartment with a big fridge and a great range kept spotlessly clean.  Wellesley Park is a very nice urban enclave within the improving area of Dorchester.  No TV unfortunately...
1178371,31952019,2015-05-12,27268491,Foster'S,Our time in Boston was great. Actually we were surprised by a living and really european city.
This experience was fully improved by Victoria's attention. Her acomodation was really nice,well prepared and always clean as anyone could desire. We liked a lot how she cared about every detail. So guys,do not doubt if you have any question or need,they're going to do their best.,,
About the room,it's located on the main floor of the house next to another single room,a bathroom and her living room where they play the piano. They are living upstairs so you're going to have your own privacy and space.,,,
"The neighborhood was really quiet. It's a place where you will find a lot of residencial houses and a supermarket or a subway station just 5 minutes away walking.\"",,,,,
1178371,32751544,2015-05-21,29802982,Nero,"Victoria was very nice and helpful. She always try her best to accommodate us for everything we needed. The house is really clean and has got all the amenities we wanted. Wifi is fast, room is larger than enough for single traveler, bathroom is spacious and has got plenty of hot water. I have personally made some good use of the kitchen and the fridge, she provides a simple set of cookwares, but definitely enough if not for making anything fancy. All the guest rooms are on the first floor while Victoria and her husband live upstairs, so guests will have plenty of privacy. Victoria will not disturb you or go into your room during your stay by any means, but they are for sure friendly people and are willing to give you traveling tips during your stay in Boston. All guests will have their own key and they are free to go in and out of the house anytime they want. The house is located in a beautiful neighborhood, just 3 mins walk from Shawmut train station and 10 mins walk from grocery stores. This is my first airbnb experience, and I am very pleased with it."

1178371,33437739,2015-05-28,6126640,Ali,Victoria was very welcoming and provided excellent instructions on how to get to her home.  We loved the area as it was very quaint and only 3 minutes walk to station. It was no more than a 20 minute ride on the 'T' into Boston city centre and there were plenty trains. We had the smaller of the two rooms which was good for short stay.
1178371,33588629,2015-05-30,23504707,Robin,The unique character of the houses in this area was fascinating. The historic style and maintenance is a challenge
1178371,33988266,2015-06-03,29585498,Mary,"Victoria is a lovely young woman who is still feeling her way around the B&B world. Her home is very functional and has a full kitchen that is for the sole use of guests. A five minute walk takes you to the T - great for getting in and out of Boston. Victoria does teach piano students, and you might be there when she is teaching if you have an early afternoon. However this is not bothersome. In fact, it is rather enjoyable to hear how she works with youngsters who haven't practiced. There is no television, a bit of a drawback if you don't stay out late at night. Victoria provides a coffee press, coffee, creamer, sugar, tea and a kettle. A great start to the morning. The T trains pass a few blocks over and it sounds like happy summer thunder. It certainly wasn't a problem for us - after an hour or so we never noticed it again."

She informed me upwards and even at our stay about all needed information, which was highly appreciated! My sister and I absolutely recommend to stay at Victoria’s and Tim’s house in Boston. The neighborhood was beautiful, though a bit outside the city.  But the metro station isn’t far to walk too. I definitely would come back  :-)"
1178371,35649863,2015-06-21,24909364,Anja,"I booked two rooms for my parents, so they had the whole house. Victoria was a great host and my mom enjoyed listening to her music:)"
It is close to the subway,"but my parents weren't bothered by the \"\"noise\"\". Therefore great deal if you want to visit Boston!\"",,,,

1178371,38154444,2015-07-13,21717340,Andrew,"I will agree what has been written in so many reviews before mine. Super clean space and simply a gorgeous part of Boston to call home base. The porch is so inviting that I considered just staying there watching the day go by. I went to the Harpoon Brewery, Harvard, MIT and the Red Sox game, instead. :-)"
The walk to the T is super quick and very well-lit for the return home if you are late (as I was both nights).,,,,,
Victoria has good maps available for reference to get you around that make navigation a breeze.,,,,,
"The space is well-organized and communication with Victoria was simply a  pleasure. I don't think I can add anything to what has already been said by so many people. The only downside was that I was not the first from my hometown to visit so I couldn't put a pin in the map. :-)\"",,,,,
1178371,38827703,2015-07-19,14735144,Ann,"Victoria has a cozy home, a share kitchen and easy access to subway. Overall a very nice stay. Thank you Victoria for sharing your home!"

With the metro close by, it's a good location to discover the city from. Moreover, we had a (free) parking lot right in front of their house. The apartment was clean and tidy and with a fully equipped kitchen."
1178371,39482634,2015-07-24,30407515,Julie,"The room with two twin beds was exactly what we needed. The house is a  5-minute walk from the subway, and the neighborhood was clean and safe. I went for a run one morning and felt very safe. The hosts were friendly and answered our questions promptly. I would definitely stay here again."
1178371,39754606,2015-07-26,33143381,Kevin,This was perfect. The room was clean and quiet. The metro station was 2 minutes away if you're walking slowly and the neighborhood was beautiful. Thanks Veronica we had a blast.

From the nearby stop on the red line, it was easy enough to get everywhere I needed to go. The neighborhood was beautiful, and I never felt uncomfortable coming back after dark."
The house/room itself was really nice. It was super clean,and Victoria provided clean towels. The kitchen was stocked with all the pans/utensils I needed to prepare breakfast and an occasional dinner.,,,,
"I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a convenient place to stay in Boston. Staying here again will be my first choice the next time I'm back in town. \"",,,,,
1178371,41747977,2015-08-09,25658152,Robert,I arrived at Victoria's lovely house by car and I had no problems of finding it and getting a parking space near it. The neighborhood was very nice and looked so inviting I could have easily spent the whole time there but Downtown Boston and all the other things were just too tempting. My room was very spacious for one person and nice in general. I shared the whole lower level of the house containing a kitchen and a bathroom with 2 other guests which wasn't a problem at all. My stay was very pleasant and I would highly recommend it!

The room was great, she was very helpful in helping me get to where I was going in town, the house is very near to the subway station.  The station is outside of the downtown area, but I rode from the opposite side of the city one night and almost missed the stop because the trip was so short.  The bedroom has its own private lock, so you don't have to worry about the other people staying in the house being able to get in to your room.  There really wasn't anything bad to mention from the experience.  If I make the trip back to Boston this is the first room I will look for."
1178371,46115492,2015-09-08,30687279,Becky,Victorias home is located near the subway station she was very accomodating with arrival times.  Her home is very clean and spacious. We were staying in the smaller of the two rooms but it had everything we needed.
1178371,47029466,2015-09-15,18618742,Jaril,The listing was as described and I felt safe walking around the neighborhood amongst its beautiful 3 storey homes. As I was late arriving the key was in a key safe and Victoria sent me the code.

Nous partagions la cuisine et la salle de bains avec les hôtes de la deuxième chambre, et tout s'est très bien passé. Victoria est très accueillante et sympathique. Le quartier est calme et la station de métro est vraiment très proche (2 min à pied)."

1178371,48862945,2015-09-29,32084662,Carol,"Because we wanted to be assured of private accommodations, a friend and I rented both of Victoria's first floor rooms. Please refer to my review under Historical Gaslight Street - R2."
1178371,49129286,2015-10-01,39753432,Kristina,Victoria welcomed me and gave me all the necessary information to get around. The room is very clean and tidy and honestly I haven't sleep the whole summer as good as I did on that bed - very comfortable. There is a fully functional kitchen and a very nice bathroom.

1178371,50745786,2015-10-14,11706158,Gloria,"I got there earlier than the check-in time to leave my luggage at her place. Although it was early in the morning, she arranged to meet me to drop off my luggage. The place is very well-organized and clean. I especially liked her touch of having a personal basket for each room somewhat like a locker. And I like the idea of having a mirror and a shelf to make a bedroom vanity. It made it easier to put make up in the morning. This place is very close from the subway station which is always a plus."
1178371,50914420,2015-10-16,32084662,Carol,Please see review under Historical Gaslight Street - R2.

1178371,51709474,2015-10-24,14877006,Helen,"Victoria's home was the perfect spot for me. It was located in a very convenient and attractive neighbourhood and Victoria and Tim were excellent hosts- friendly and available but respecting my privacy. My room was beautifully and simply decorated, clean and comfortable, with plenty of space and the bathroom and kitchen facilities were separate from Victoria and Tims facilities which was also a plus."
1178371,52045445,2015-10-26,38089003,Jenny,"The listing description is 100% accurate. If anything, the place was even nicer than I expected! I arrived late in the afternoon and Victoria wasn't home, but she left the key for me in the lockbox on the porch. I got in with no problems and found my room very easily. The space was beautiful and ENORMOUS! The pictures make it look a little smaller than it really is, it's amazing. The kitchen has a full sized fridge, stove top and dishes for your use, so you can eat there and save some money. Everything was very clean and welcoming. The bed was CRAZY comfortable and there's a mirror and shelf you can use as a kind of vanity for your makeup in the morning. There was shampoo, conditioner, towels, lotion, and a hairdryer all provided- if you're staying here you don't have to pack any of that stuff, which saves so much suitcase room and is crazy helpful. Victoria was very sweet and helpful. The location is also great. It takes probably 60 seconds to get to Shawmut station and go right downtown on the red line subway, very very easy. Lots of food/grocery right down the street in walking distance as well. I came home late at night a couple times and the neighbourhood felt safe, well lit, etc. The houses around there are also gorgeous. Lovely neighbourhood. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Boston!"
1178371,52495317,2015-10-30,24294559,Suman,Victoria was very helpful with communicating and giving directions. Place was very close to T station. Place was very clean and spacious bathroom. I would totally stay anytime here.

Everything is as described: there are two rooms downstairs, Victoria lives upstairs with her family. My room was spacious with lots of storage space, even a small desk and chair. The bed is a bit on the small side, but other than that no complaints. You share the bathroom with any guests in the other room, likewise with the well-equipped kitchen (massive fridge!!). Speedy and stable WIFI well appreciated, just wish there had been a washing machine. Rarely got to see Victoria, but she was always quick in replying to any messages and provided perfect directions to get to the place. Would recommend!"

1178371,65261469,2016-03-12,45909244,Victoria,"The first 2 days, no one else had booked the adjacent room so it was very quiet and peaceful. The host had left instructions in the bedroom for house rules, wifi information, helpful traveling apps, and checkout information as well. The bedroom was very comfortable, I didn't use the kitchen much, but it is well stocked with whatever cutlery you might need. The shared bathroom had everything labeled so that I knew where to put things (and not to get confused with R1's things)."
The most convenient part was the 2 minute walk to the T since I spent most of my time in downtown Boston. Even on the nights that I returned to the house later,there seemed to be a decent amount of people around that I didn't feel unsafe. It took me about an average of 20 minutes to get into downtown Boston.,,,,
As the host warned,the walls are thin,so when the adjacent room was occupied,it definitely changes the experience a bit,but it's really not a big deal if you're looking for a comfortable,convenient

Really easy to get to and from the airport from here - just one change at South Station and a couple of minutes walking from the station to the house. Direct train to Harvard. I only met Victoria at the start, it is a pretty self-sufficient kind of Airbnb experience. The bed is incredibly comfortable and the little kitchen is well appointed for fixing breakfast or a snack.

There were labels throughout the space to identify were common household items were stored, which was really helpful. A set of towels were provided as well as slippers. The room itself was cozy and the temperature was always right during the day or night. Clear instructions were also given on a nightstand which answered any questions a guest could have. The bathroom was just as neat and organized. The neighborhood was really nice, and close to a subway station that quickly got me to the city."

1178371,77558670,2016-06-01,63663735,Katherine,"I couldn't have asked for a better first experience using Airbnb! This home was perfect for a solo traveler doing some sightseeing in Boston: quiet, located in a gorgeous neighborhood, but so close to a T station that I was downtown in a quick 20 minutes. The room and shared spaces were clean and well-organized, and overall a very comfortable place to stay."

You can hear the rumble of the trains as they pass by....but, I didn't consider it annoying, just noticeable.  The common areas (bath/kitchen)  are shared with another airbnber.  Victoria was very accommodating in my late arrival.  I highly recommend!"

The first day I was greeted by a chirpy happy neighbour walking a dog and baby who I thought was her husband but wasn't. Her husband was waiting home. They have a huge map in the kitchen where you pin up your place of origin. Quite neat to see the number of pins from all over the world."
Everything was neat clean spacious and bright. They provide you with maps,take out menus,basic cutlery tea and coffee ingredients fridge to stock your food,a gas stove all to yourself a microwave and toaster and amazingly house slippers too. Even though you share the washroom with 2 other individuals you seldom cross each other's path. The washroom is spacious clean and with baskets for every individuals toiletries which I liked.,,
Victoria and her husband are very non intrusive one thing I absolutely loved,having a sense of privacy. They are helpful with Victoria promptly bringing over a charger as I had forgotten mine home.,,,,
My only issue was the front door handle which was very jammed and I struggled with it almost everyday trying to be quiet as they have a notice stuck on the door that they have a nursery above it. 3 out of 4 days I did not manage to open it and had to seek assistance.,,,,,
Overall the place has a very happy vibe and I enjoyed my stay.,,,,,

1178371,82638317,2016-06-28,21713958,Clara,Victoria es una buena anfitriona. Se preocupó por algunas de mis necesidades durante las dos semanas largar que estuve en su casa. No me puso inconvenientes a la hora de dejar el equipaje en mi último día.
"La casa está limpia y se encuentra en un parque muy tranquilo cerca de una estación de metro. \"",,,,,
1178371,83207540,2016-07-01,16440337,Peg,"Everything was communicated through email.  The directions emailed were excellent and I had no trouble finding the place , my room etc."
It was easy to get to public transportation and I especially liked being so close to the JFK museum.,,,,,
The kitchen was great..Nice and roomy.,,,,,
All in All a good experience.,,,,,

1178371,84760830,2016-07-09,18845388,Lexie,"I stayed there for two days. Victoria was very helpful on providing local information, she is responsive to the questions before and during my stay. Although we did not meet when first move-in, but the house location is easy-to-find and I have no problem access my room. The house is just 5 min walk to T-station red line and about 20 min to central Boston. It also has all the kitchenette if you want to cook some light meal."
1178371,85099530,2016-07-10,48714185,Sandra,"Victoria's place is very conveniently located - a few minutes from the train station, but yet very quiet and old fashioned neighborhood. Victoria is a great host, and I think you'll not be disappointed. A good pick."
1178371,85651616,2016-07-12,62470994,James,"Although I did not get to meet Victoria, her husband Tim was a great host when introducing me to the apartment. It was very clean, and it was apparent that they had experience in hosting many guests and treating them well (i.e. they had instructions prepared well before my arrival, and everything went very smoothly). I highly recommend staying with Victoria and Tim for future visits to Boston. The neighborhood was very nice, and the green space in front of their house was a welcoming change of scenery from the city."
1178371,87290668,2016-07-19,71414687,Soo Jin,"I stayed for 6 days in Victoria's cozy home. Victoria is really nice person and She gave me a lot of local information. Also it is very close to T-station and takes about 20 minutes to downtown! So if I revisit boston, I'd like to stay Victoria's house :)"
1178371,88314056,2016-07-24,72300245,Monika,Sehr nette hilfsbereite Gastgeber. Alles wie beschrieben. Altes historisches Viertel mit schönen Häusern. Gutes U-Bahnsystem in Boston. Haltestelle schnell erreichbar. Fußläufig Supermarkt und Imbisse erreichbar. Wobei ich persönlich in die Gegend der Geschäfte nachts als Frau eher nicht mehr alleine hingehen würde. Ansonsten alles bestens.
1178371,90306464,2016-07-31,52009333,Lucas,"My stay was delightful, Victoria is really nice"
1178371,91150285,2016-08-04,42519258,Tiffa,Great stay at Victoria's. Host greeted me upon arrival and gave me a tour. Very very clean and organized! Would definitely recommend this place to others!
1178371,92393399,2016-08-08,28033078,Stefan,"Victoria und Tim bewohnen ein sehr schönes Häuschen im Viktorianische Stil; Im Untergeschoss befindet sich quasi eine zweite Wohnung mit zwei Zimmern, Küche und Bad. Ich habe während meines Aufenthalts das kleinere der beiden Zimmer bewohnt. Die Kommunikation im Vorhinein lief ganz einfach über Airbnb. Tim, Victorias Mann, hat mich freundlich empfangen und mir alles gezeigt. In der Wohnung hat man alles was man so braucht. Wenn es an irgendwas fehlt, fragt Victoria. Die Kommunikation lief dann auch meist über Airbnb; die beiden haben einen kleinen Sohn und da will man nicht ständig klingeln."
Die Nachbarschaft,Dorchester,ist ein netter kleiner Vorort mit vielen Viktorianischen Häusern. Die Leute sind alle ziemlich freundlich und man kommt leicht ins Gespräch. Nach Downtown Boston kommt man innerhalb von 20-30 Minuten mit der Red Line (fährt auch bis Harvard). die Busverbindungen sind auch gut. Man kann aber auch mal einen Tag in Dorchester verbringen; die Straße runter gibt es einen Basketballplatz,Baseball- und Footballfeld; es gibt ein paar kleine Läden; einen netten Pub mit gutem Bier; einen fantastischen Vietnamesen; und eine Haltestation Richtung Downtown eine Bucht mit Strandabschnitt.,,

1178371,93517042,2016-08-13,71640621,Vadeesiri,I had a pleasant stay here!!
1178371,94641664,2016-08-16,54771297,Amy,"This was such a great value. It was clean, as described and I felt safe, which was incredibly important since I was staying alone. I didn't know much about Boston, so in the future I would consider staying closer to some of the tourist-y sites. Nevertheless, the location was conveniently located right next the Red Line which could take you all the way from Quincy to Harvard. It also allowed a fairly easy trip to the airport. In addition, Victoria was prompt when answering my questions beforehand and all of the hosts' expectations were clearly outlined for a great stay. Overall, this was a great Airbnb experience and they were perfect hosts."
6317722,34733049,2015-06-11,34371442,Darrin,"After making the reservation, Jason called and we talked a bit about the location, suggestions on getting from the airport, arrangements for a slightly earlier check in, etc. There were several text messages and emails regarding additions to the property and the lockbox. We were pleasantly surprised that Jason was there to greet us!"
We were the 2nd group to stay in #3. The pictures were realistic,and while the size was compact,we had 4 adults comfortably sitting around!,,,
Jason and his family have done a nice job on the remodeling and decorating. Jason was attentive and responsive to our needs (more towels since we had 4 adults and a longer visit),passwords to other services,etc.,,,
Situations beyond Jason's control- bedrooms face the street,I'm a light sleeper so could hear some of the noises- so I played my music/white noise... and sunrise was at 5:13AM!!! A little bright!,,,,
On the plus side- the deck overlooks some cute houses and Dorchester Height Monument. The huge TV (that we never turned on!) Also 1 minute from bus stop and about a mile from the T (subway)station- buy the 7 day Charlie card! And several shops and food places within 2-3 min walk. We felt safe walking in the area both day and night.,,,,,
We enjoyed the location and more so- having a full sized kitchen and space to hang out. The condo had 2 bedrooms with REAL beds which were VERY comfortable to sleep in! If we make it back to Boston,I would certainly contact Jason again!,,,,

6317722,35273176,2015-06-16,35579336,John,"Fantastic 4th-floor apartment in South Boston.  Jason was attentive without being overbearing, providing plenty of contact methods and checking in by text a couple times during my stay.  Would definitely stay with him again if I find myself in Boston again."
6317722,35595143,2015-06-20,5265298,Scott,This listing was very clean and well laid out. Very comfortable for the 3 of us. The neighborhood had everything in abundance within short walking distance. New stair runners installed for the stairs leading up to the apartment which made the walk up much easier.
6317722,36037646,2015-06-24,16440084,Guoying,"Jason's place is awesome and looked exactly like the pictures (& even better!!)  - it was clean, modern, very comfortable and felt like home. Check-in was seamless and Jason was always prompt in replying to our queries! This place is highly recommended! :))"
6317722,37193999,2015-07-05,6639472,Ian,"Jason was an incredible host.  The apartment was immaculate when we arrived.  Check in was super easy and we had no problems whatsoever.  Jason was easily reachable, though we never really needed a thing from him.  The neighborhood is pretty quiet and there are plenty of restaurants, convenience stores, and other things around."
Jason was kind enough to invite us to a small BBQ one night and it was such a great time.  As long as Jason has properties on AirBNB in Boston,"that's where I'm headed.\"",,,,
6317722,38286034,2015-07-14,3115291,Roman,"Our stay in this apartment was very pleasant.  The apartment is tastefully decorated and very comfortable.  Although we didn't get to meet Jason, he was very accessible when we had questions.  The three flights of stairs are worth it for the view of downtown nearby as well as the deck in the rear overlooking a quiet street."
My favorite part about this stay may have been the location of the apartment.  The 9 bus stops at the corner and provides easy access to the subway.  Also,Broadway has quite a few nice (not particularly fancy,just lively and comfortable) restaurants and bars,and although there were a lot of people on the street after midnight on the weekend,the apartment is well-isolated from the street noise and the streets felt very safe at all times.,
And be sure to try the clam chowder at Legal Seafood (harbor side patio,"if possible)!\"",,,,
6317722,38916137,2015-07-19,37339984,Berkant,"This apartment is exactly as it is described. View of the Boston skyline is great in the bedrooms. The sitting room and the balcony outside is comfortable, we had dinners on the balcony. Air conditioning is more than enough. All necesary stuff like towels, soap, tissue were plentiful. Since it has just undergone renovation, every piece of furniture was new and clean. Communication with Jason was smooth. Strongly recommended!"
6317722,39350118,2015-07-22,4403646,Paul,"Jason is an extremely responsive host, and the place is exactly what the pictures depict."
I actually prefer not having to see my host unless there are issues,"and Jason has deftly done that. He made me feel he is available all the time!\"",,,,

Although we didn't get to meet Jason in person, he made himself very accessible, and prepared all the information before hand to us. For my future stays in Boston I will definitely be booking in at any of Jason's properties!"

6317722,40248964,2015-07-29,36571748,Christina,"I had a wonderful experience staying in this condo.  It was just as beautiful as the photos.  It was clean and Jason made our stay so easy.  I was visiting Boston while taking my son on a college tour.  The location was perfect and just a short car ride to everywhere we wanted to go.  The neighborhood was safe and very accessible to the major roadways.  It was far better than staying in a hotel!  Having a washer and dryer available for our use was also a nice perk.  The bed was very comfortable.  Truly a wonderful experience.  I told Jason that if my son gets accepted to one of the colleges we saw in Boston, I will become a regular."
6317722,41406127,2015-08-07,37405978,Harald,"It was a very pleasant stay in the apartment: everything needed (and some things more) were there, and the location was very convenient. There is a good bus connection to the center of Boston, and a station of the Red Line is a 10-minute walk away. Several shops are nearby, too."
The apartment itself is very nice and clean. Even if there is a little bit noise from the street,it didn't disturbed me at all. Especially,I liked sitting on the deck belonging to the apartment.,,,
Jason is a great host - if you need him,"then he will respond immediately.\"",,,,

Everything is brand new and very clean, the rooms are a good size, beds are comfortable, and the living room is a very nice place to relax after a long day. The bathroom is also nice with a good shower."
Overall this place is great for the price! The only downside I can think of is location,"it takes about 10 min to walk to the subway but we just took an Uber to anywhere downtown and it cost us only about $8. Jason was very helpful as a host and gave us recommendations and instructions clearly. Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good Boston experience in a nice neighborhood.\"",,,,

The apt was great too! Just as stated/shown. Clean,modern and comfortable! We were 2 couples so the two double beds were perfect. Great location too,couple of nice places to eat nearby,highly recommend The Parmount for breakfast,"about 7min walk away. \"",
6317722,52746539,2015-11-01,46466166,Crystal,"The apartment was exactly as depicted in the photographs; clean, comfortable and beautiful.  Jason, Larry and Valerie were exceptional hosts and very attentive to our needs.  I would highly suggest paying  the fee for private parking behind the apartment building as this was a busy area of S. Boston and street parking was not available.  If you are a light sleeper you should know the bedrooms face the street and some bars/restaurants in the area were quite loud.  We received an unexpected visit at midnight from the downstairs guests who thought they had rented our apartment for the weekend.  They entered our locked apartment with their key and were about to start unpacking their belongings when they noticed we were in there.  We soon realized all 3 apartments in the building were keyed the same which is not ideal if you bring valuables, or are concerned for your safety and privacy."

It is also near the T making it easy to get to Copley Square and other areas. The apartment was clean, nice wood floors, newer appliances and has a nice little deck off the living room. Jason provided excellent directions and communicated with timely emails. He was very responsive when we asked for additional hangars and coffee cups. This was  our first experience with Air B&B and will definitely try it again."
6317722,72448638,2016-05-02,56055893,Gary,"My best Airbnb experience yet!! What more can I say? A few things: Jason the host was responsive and gave me his cell of anything came up during the weekend but didn't bother us at all. Getting in was super seamless with a lock box and key. The place was BRAND NEW as advertised. Beautiful and clean. The condo has all the comforts of home. The place was stocked with paper towels and TP, fresh clean towels and shower amenities as well as Kcup coffee pods and maker, pots pans dishes and utensils. The beds were big and comfy and the big TV and cable was a plus. A deck from fresh air and to sit and converse. You could not ask for a better location and the cost was definitely a value. A little noisy as its in the city but to be expected and didn't bother us at all. There's 3 stories to climb to get home so don't forget anything or yore doing a cardio workout! Simply loved the place, the location and the host and would recommend both to friends and family with no hesitation."
6317722,72920558,2016-05-05,63979393,Howard,"From the first contact Jason made us feel welcome, comfortable and at home for the three days at this location.  My business partner and I were attending a convention and were stunned and outraged at the cost of hotels in Boston. Having never used Airbnb I was concerned that saving money may not be such a good idea if the accommodations weren't adequate.  I was won over to Airbnb on the basis of this stay and Jason made it very easy to become an Airbnb advocate.   The location was great and the accommodations were first class.  Check-in and out was a breeze and Jason was available if we needed any help, which we didn't.   The parking can be a bit tricky.  Read the street signs carefully.  If you are missing the exercise room in a hotel, then the three flights of curving stairway will make up for that.   That being said, I would use Airbnb again because of this experience and would happily go back to Jason anytime I plan to be in Boston.   Next time I would hope for better weather to take advantage of the outside deck."

Tiene luz natural por todos lados y los espacios son agradables. las camas y las almohadas son deliciosas y las sabanas dan esa sensación de limpieza. el edificio es antiguo, muy bonito y esta muy bien conservado. la zona es inmejorable, super segura y llega de opciones para comer y comprar las cosas básicas. llegamos a las 10 pm y estábamos preocupados de no poder conseguir algo para comer, y a menos de una calle habían como 10 opciones incluido un 7eleven. el edificio tiene lavadora y secadora pero en la esquina hay una lavandería que te lava por kilos y te entrega el mismo día. Aunque hay servicio de transporte muy cerca, siempre tomamos uber, ya que éramos 4 y nos salía mas económico hacerlo así (no pagábamos mas de 8 dólares a faneuill hall)."
El hospedaje en este apartamento fue fundamental para que nuestras vacaciones hayan sido tan placenteras. tanto los niños como nosotros teníamos espacio para leer o ver televisión.  el edificio es muy silencioso,y aunque la zona tiene mucha vida,no se siente mucho ruido en las noches.,,,
las personas que viven y trabajan alrededor son educadas y te saludan cuando pasas.,,,,,
Jason está muy pendiente de que todo esté bien. tiene datos importantes y curiosos que no duda en compartir contigo. te recomienda restaurantes,sitios de interés,opciones para caminar y tomar algo.,,,

4679319,78388017,2016-06-06,42794885,Brandon,"The apartment was located in the basement and it was very dark. It was a small studio with a tiny kitchenette. It was exactly 1 mile away from the prudential center (I (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)d it) and at least a 20-minute walk, not 7 minutes as claimed. Even if you ran, you would hardly be able to make it in 7 minutes."
In terms of facilities,the wi-fi was very slow and with the apartment being in the basement,the connection was choppy and my devices often disconnected or couldn't connect to the router. The washer and dryer cost $2 EACH,plus the dryer doesn't even work properly!! My clothes would come out wet and the dryer was only half full.,,
In terms of dealing with the host,he made me sign a lease,which basically says I won't stay past the dates listed on the airbnb. I wouldn't have stayed in the tiny,dark apartment any longer than I had to anyway,but he should understand that this is not the way airbnb works! Also,in the contract

We had a fantastic stay at Boylstonstreet. At first we thought is was to far from downtown Boston but the walk through Boylstonstreet was nice. There are rental bikes just across the road and T-linestations are within walking distance. Everything you need is in the appartment. A supermarket is just down the street and you even have a discountcard for this place. Bed,bathroom,kitchen,livingroom,"Wifi was just great. We would certainly recommend this placce. We made reservations for another appartment but the got cancelled just a few days before. Airbnb was a great help in finding us an alternative. They even gave us a discount. \"",

Very nice houses in the neighborhood,just a 4 minutes walk to the subway station that takes you conveniently downtown. Stores and facilities very close. A few blocks away there are corners that might be a bit sketchy,but around the place the neighborhood felt safe and well kept.,,,
"Full recommendation!\"",,,,,
8536113,89656560,2016-07-29,83919329,Ryan,"Really nice house inside! We would have appreciated more towels and a curtain for the window in the bathroom. Also, the Ac works really well, maybe too well because it did get a little cold at night; maybe thicker blankets or just adjust it before you go to bed. Overall we loved our experience and would stay again!"

Only thing I recommend is to make sure to check the street cleaning signs! Coming from someone who doesn't live somewhere where they clean the streets, we almost got our rental car towed the first morning. Regardless though, there was plenty of parking, and lots of space in the house for me and my coworkers to relax after the long days during our business trip."

1884045,8648221,2013-11-10,9815221,Yolanda,"I contacted Sarah to rent a bedroom for a night for my trip with my daughter to Boston. When we got to Boston, she welcomed us kindly to her home, showing us the room, bathroom and offering us access to her kitchen. The room was great. Two beds and a large closet. Sarah was a great host. She even showed us around Boston driving us to our location beforehand so we could know where to go and how to get there. Aside from a host, we found a friend in Sarah. She made our experience great. Thank you Sarah for your hospitality and kindness."

We arrived later than expected with her (10 pm) and her brother welcomed and showed us everything. Her family is very friendly. Everything is perfect except for the party noise from the neighborhood, but it was not long, ended about 12am."

The service is excellent and the room is warm,comfortable and clean. The neigborhood is near the bus station so you can easily take the bus to go around the city. Definetely, the best choice."

1884045,10692762,2014-03-03,10984700,Renaud,"Even though I stayed only only night, Sarah was the warmest and nicest person. My flight from Paris was delayed, we communicated very easily and fastly by text message,  I really appreciated that. The room I had was as described, clean, quiet and nice. So was the bathroom and the entire place. I slept like a baby."

1884045,11087329,2014-03-19,6533406,Mirabel,"The room was clean but it was cold- I had to wear a winter duck down jacket with two blankets when I was sleeping. toilet was not easy to flash. Location was okay but if you don't have a car it wouldn't be easy to move around. Bus station is around 7 mins walking distance, and there is no company taxi around, but only gipsy taxis. It was scary to take them at the first time since we were two girls. On top of that they try to deceive you if you don't know the fare. (In my experience, around 1.5-2 miles for $10 depending on the traffic and the tips) Sarah, her son and her brother were very sweet, I feel bad since I got a personal message from Sarah which was asking me to be quiet.. (we spent around 30 mins in the house right before going to bed. We were talking and laughing in the room) I have several experience through airbnb and that was the first time to hear that.. it was nice that they have cereal and milk for breakfast."

For some person it might be a little cold in the winter but there would be enough blankets. For me the tempreature was perfect. Sarah and her family (son and brother) are very friendly. Sarah welcomed me and invited me to have an early dinner with her as she just was about to eat.
Breafast was milk and cornflakes.,,,,,
Sarah's house is just three walking minutes from the bus,"which brings you directly to downtown or south station within 15minutes.\"",,,,
1884045,11293483,2014-03-28,11769775,Ibraheem,As always enjoyed staying with Sarah and her family. Clean home and lovely family. Just wonderful family. Will recommend staying with her to others.
1884045,11329087,2014-03-30,3079179,Brittney,"Sarah and her family are friendly and accommodating hosts! Sarah was extremely flexible in in my arrival and departure times. She and I enjoyed nice conversation over a traditional dish from her home country the first evening I arrived, and her brother even offered to make me breakfast in the days during my stay. The room is exactly as it appears in picture. The location is great for anyone visiting/attending Boston University. Only a 10 minute walk from the campus and BU Medical Center. Also, the location is great for the use of public transport. Only about 5 minute walk to local bus stop, with Dudley Station nearby. I would recommend bringing a small blanket if booking during the winter season, as the room can get a bit chilly at night. Otherwise I found the accommodations quite comfortable. I would highly recommend staying with Sarah and her family!"
1884045,11496315,2014-04-05,13492547,Erick,"My days with Sarah, Desmond and Sam were more of home 'reunion'. My long exhausting flight had drained me and therefore a well-deserved bed rest was important. The room is lovely and quiet and Serah has made it as private and yet accessible as it could get. They also generously offered meals during the days I could not prepare one for myself. Serah's son Desmond and brother instantly hit too as my best friends and 'local guides.'  There neighborhood is also rather calm,clean and accessible. Highly recommended."
1884045,11527310,2014-04-06,4586274,Ashley,"Sarah is such a wonderful host.  Greeted me at the door with a warm smile and huge hug.  This was my first time booking just a room vs a full apartment so I was a little bit nervous.  I felt right at home after getting to know Sarah.  The room was clean and she even made me dinner, and gave me snacks!  Thanks for a great stay Sarah"
1884045,11702359,2014-04-12,3011863,Camille,Very comfortable place to stay. The breakfast food was highly appreciated and it was good to feel homy after a long day of explorations. Thanks!

1884045,12110414,2014-04-23,1809814,Ted,"Sarah is a very kind host. My friend and I stayed here for the Boston Marathon along with another couple in for the same reason, and we had a nice stay."
There was some confusion with the rooms at first,but Sarah took care of it for us without too much trouble.,,,,
The only main detraction from staying here is that it was a bit inconvenient to get in and out of the more central part of Boston,and there wasn't much going on in the area - my friend and I didn't spend much time hanging around the area except to come home and sleep.,,,,
Otherwise,Sarah and her family were very nice and welcoming. The room was comfortable,and she provided a mini fridge for us to use,already stocked with milk and some other supplies,along with coffee,tea

1884045,12444902,2014-05-02,14736481,Laurene,"I was skeptical about reserving a stay at AirBnB since I would be traveling with my 13yr old daughter. Safety of course, was my number one concern.  After reviewing the available list of host, I decided to go with Sarah. I must say, that staying in her home, was such a marvelous experience.  My daughter and I felt welcome, content, and safe, right from the start.  We were welcomed by Sarah and her brother, and were given a tour of the house, as well as the amenities available to us.  There was another guest staying at this time, but we did not see each other.  The environment in her home is quiet, and peaceful.  I will definitely recommend Sarah as host, and will make this my first choice if ever visiting the Boston area again."
1884045,12867794,2014-05-12,14914029,Pi,"Sarah and her brother are very nice people. They gave us warm welcome and treat us like families. Sarah's house is clean and quiet. The bed is very comfortable. Thank you, we have a nice trip in Boston."

Neighbourhood a little out of the way. Takes a while on the bus to get into town but the bus is covered on the subway pass which is great."
1884045,13049730,2014-05-18,2539899,Violeta,"Sarah and her family are very nice. There was confusion about which room I had reserved, but was able to sleep in the other room that was not occupied. The room was picked up and the shared bathroom is on the same floor as the room. The apartment is located close to the T at the Dudley station stop. I would recommend this locale to people who are traveling as a group. I stayed one night on my own and was uncomfortable walking around at night. My friend arrived the next day and I felt fine."

Location wise, it is very close to Dudley Square Station (~5 min walk), which has bus that goes directly to downtown. I chose to walk to the nearest subway station on my first morning, and it was only about 15 minutes walk on a main street. I would recommend Sarah's place to anyone."

1884045,14420050,2014-06-18,7292856,Lauri,"Sarah and her brother Sam were warm and gracious hosts, and they kindly put me up on short notice when I was in Boston unexpectedly. The group of people talking loudly and bouncing a basketball right outside my window until 1am unfortunately made it difficult to sleep, and the mouse trap under the bed did not instill confidence. Still, it's hard to beat Sarah's very affordable price and I genuinely enjoyed meeting both her and Sam."
1884045,14495722,2014-06-20,16114098,Alyssa,"This was a really good location, about a $12 taxi ride from Boston's South Station which was perfect for me. I was really impressed by how nice Sarah and her brother were, providing food, wifi and directions. Grocery stores weren't too far to walk. I have to say as a female solo traveller I didn't feel safe walking around at night by myself, but it was the same in other places too. The night I was there there was a party also but it died down about midnight. Thanks Sarah :)"
1884045,14558703,2014-06-22,9267223,Marco,Sarah is a very warm and friendly person who did everything she could to make my stay as pleasant as possible. The room was nice and cosy. During my stay (in the summer) some of the neighbours (and their friends) were hanging around in front of the building and were quite noisy. Several shops and Dubly Bus Station are just a few blocks away.
1884045,14832016,2014-06-27,16467663,Olaolu,We had a great time with Sarah and her family. Very warm and hospitable.
The neighborhood did give me some concerns because there were many loiterers all hours of the day and even late at night.  I spoke with Sarah and Sam about this and they agreed.,,,,,
"There is really nothing Sarah can do about this. One can only hope the municipal authorities of the City of Roxbury can do something it.\"",,,,,

A bus stop is just around the corner, it took me around 15 minutes to get to Boston Backbay. Nothing to complain about. I would come back anytime."
1884045,15491477,2014-07-10,10405661,Carol,"Sarah was great and very accommodating! I was in town for a conference that kept me very busy so I was not at her home for much more than sleeping, but she was a very gracious host. It was a 35 minute walk from Copley Square and I enjoyed navigating around Boston on my very first visit! The apartment is very near to the Silver Line as well. I was really glad the weather was not too hot, as the room where I stayed was on the third floor and I imagine it may be stuffy without A/C in the summer months. There was a fan provided though so I was comfortable during my stay. Sarah's son was also present to welcome guests, he was such a little gentleman and very helpful to his mother. This was my first experience with AirBnB and I will definitely do it again! Thank you Sarah for being a lovely host."

After all this is what AirBnB is about. You should stay here for more than one night. There's plenty of room to store everything."
1884045,17634772,2014-08-15,18316023,Maarten,"We didn't meet Sarah as she was on holiday.  We were welcomed by her brother Sam. He was a very friendly guy and had a good time with him. Thank you Sam! He shared with us the secrets of plantain cooking. Jummie!  Our room was comfortable and clean. Also the bathroom and kitchen was clean and provided everything u needed in case u lost/forgot something. The place is located very close to the busses to downtown. So good public transport to Boston. Also the subway isn’t very far. However, we didn’t feel comfortable walking through the neighborhood late in the evening. It was a feeling, we didn’t have any problems. It feels that’s  located on the edge between a good and bad neighborhood. But we are not familiar with Boston neighborhoods so again it’s a feeling and maybe it’s perfectly safe there. The houses of that block were all nice so..."
1884045,17875700,2014-08-18,19256637,Alison,"Sarah's home was a perfect fit for our trip to Boston.  Slightly off the beaten path but easy to access by public transit.  It was nice to stay in a neighborhood of a city rather than the city center - we met many locals while walking to and from the bus, giving us a better feeling for the real Boston."
On the weekend we visited Sarah was on her own vacation so her brother was our host.  He was very kind and quick to answer any questions.  As was Sarah with any email we sent.  I also saw her brother go out of his way to help guests - from walking them to the bus stop their first time to driving them to the train station.,,,,,
Both rooms available for guests are on the third floor with a shared bathroom - overall the set up makes for a very private stay.  The room appeared almost as it does in the picture and the description.  Our hosts had the guest bathroom stocked with toiletries for anything you may forget.  In the kitchen they provided a serrate fridge for us,water,coffee,and a basic breakfast.,,

It was a great deal and very accessible to downtown Boston by walking and the area using nearby public transportation. I recommend this room and host."

1884045,20095368,2014-09-23,18836522,Ashley,"Sarah is a nice person, yes, we were greeted with a hug- but we are reviewing the PLACE. The bathroom and kitchen were dirty, and I had to tell Sarah there is no soap or toilet paper left. No hand towel in bathroom. I guess my friend and I did not know we were staying in one of the worst areas in Boston - we did not feel comfortable at all walking around. (We saw a man peeing in the middle of the street!) You could hear people going through the garbage multiple times right outside our window and the neighbor was so loud our walls were rattling at 1030pm on a Sunday night. I would like to stay in a safer area."
1884045,20176492,2014-09-24,21675906,Laura,"Very welcoming and was able to accommodate us on very short notice. Great place to stay, very close to the train station."

Dudley station within 2 blocks of walking distance. We even walked to Fenway park for a Red Sox (URL HIDDEN) took 30 minutes, but it was a gorgeous walk and farely safe. The room was clean and photos are as is. The stairs up to the room are narrow and steep and this room is on the third floor so pack lightly. As far as safety you are given a room key to lock your belongings whole away as well as a house key for the front door. Have fun!!!!"

We loved to have the privacy being in the second floor and having the bathroom only to share with another guest.

Die Nachbarschaft wirkt eher wie eine Vorstadt und es dauert tatsächlich eine Weile,"per Bus ins Zentrum zu gelangen. Wer also \"\"Stadtleben\"\" haben möchte",dem könnte es hier zu abgelegen sein.

She was also very accomodating about my scheduled late arrival.  There is a bathroom right down the hall and her house is about a 20 minute drive to Downtown Boston.  Street parking was easy to find for the night, but during the day she let us know it was better to park in visitor parking, which has a free 2 hour max."

Sarah arranged for a self-check-in with no hassle.  The room was perfect for what I needed.

1884045,36881394,2015-07-02,34201564,Michelle,"Sarah was lovely and welcoming.  The room was as depicted.  The neighborhood, however, did not feel safe to us.  I am new to AirBnB.  I read the full description and several (not all) reviews before booking, and I did not come across anything about the neighborhood.  When we arrived, we found the unit to be part of a large building of apartments and there were 10 or 12 people loitering in front, staring at us.  We were afraid to get out of the car.  We are white and there were no other white people in the neighborhood.  My 16 year old daughter felt extremely uncomfortable.  We did stay but were afraid to leave the apartment to go out that night.  Everything did turn out fine.  Sarah and her son both helped us with our luggage and were very nice.  The room was on the third floor, which also should have been noted.  There was no air conditioning.  Again, I am new to AirBnB, so perhaps I did not look carefully enough, but I did read the full description and I don't recall being aware of these things."

1884045,41078738,2015-08-04,16584892,Ming Ho,Sarah and her son are nice. The house is alright but there're always people outside the house creating noise that somehow affects our sleep. The location is close to bus station which is good.

1884045,41810402,2015-08-09,4169510,Wendy,This was my first time using this site. I arrived to the place later than planned due to traffic. Sarah was accommodating and was there to greet me when I arrived. I was only in town for a Christian rock concert for the weekend. The location of her home was two blocks from a bus station very convenient with getting downtown. There was also parking outside for my vehicle. Although she was moving when I got ready to leave I wouldn't have had a problem with staying here again.
1884045,45528063,2015-09-03,41400571,Rafael,The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1884045,46636546,2015-09-12,42241964,Lukáš,"Stay with Sarah, was my first time via this webpage...  Everthing was better than I expect, absolutly clean and awesome. Communication with Sarah is excelent. I only can recommend."
1884045,46994048,2015-09-14,43590544,Jenny,Sarah was a very welcoming and lovely host. The room and bathroom were very clean and tidy- exactly as described. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy if you go to the downtown area. There aren't many places to eat out besides some basic take-out places. If you are arriving around dinner I would suggest picking something up beforehand. Very easy to drive or take the bus to Cambridge.
1884045,47392938,2015-09-18,41814524,Pankti,Great!  Phenomenal host - I forgot my keys at her house and she opened the doors for me at even 10pm(!). Very sweet and kind.
1884045,48090276,2015-09-23,28584693,Linda,Sarah's place was really clean and nice. She greeted us promptly and her house looked to be a renewed historic house. Pretty nice!
The rooms look just like the pictures. The tips I might leave is that the room is on the 3rd floor and has 1 bathroom to share with whoever is renting the room across the hall. This got a little frustrating since it seemed like all parties wanted to use the bathroom at the same time!,,,,,
We also ran out of toilet paper our last night,couldn't find any stock,and wasn't able to get a hold of Sarah until after we left,which was also a little frustrating. She did take care of the toilet paper situation early this morning,but our flight happened to be a really early 6:15 am flight.,
Another thing to note is that the wifi is a mifi device,but Sarah said it was a temporary solution since she just moved to this location.,,,,
The last tip is that when we returned from being out all day,the day got to a cool 60 degrees,but our room on the 3rd floor was probably 85...It was toasty! We even kept the window open all day while we were out and it was still hot! It did eventually cool down with the fan on high and the door open,but took a couple hours.,,
Aside from those things,the place was really nice and the evenings were quiet,"even with the window open. Sarah was very friendly and prompt with responses. Lovely place with amazing wood stairs and floors... very nice touch!\"",,,

It's a easy 5 minute walk to the Dudley busstation,the 4 or 5 Silver line will take you directly downtown. Every taxi can take you back to your room for about $15,-,,,
The room was spacious and the beds comfy,although very squeeky. We did find the room a bit warm.,,,,
The bathroom is shared with the other room,"if occupied. But it wasn't any problem for us. All in all it's a good alternative to an expensive hotel. Thanks Sarah!\"",,,,
1884045,51179486,2015-10-18,45161114,Dennis,"Sarah was very nice, the place was as described. Quick walk to Dudley station making it easy to get around town."
1884045,51519952,2015-10-20,11607193,Chris,Sarah was very kind! She woke up very late to let me in and help me find my room. It is a deal in the middle of Boston! Thank Sarah!
1884045,51931372,2015-10-25,44786706,Abigail,Sarah was wonderful. She was very sweet and easy to connect with. I had to come late when I checked in and she was very flexible and accommodating.  The room was as described and there were other guests staying next door but I still felt that I had my provacy. Overall a very nice stay.
1884045,52611267,2015-10-31,45406045,Belinda,"Sarah and her family were very welcoming! The room was exactly as pictured. It was my first time in Boston and the area was a little rougher than I thought it would be. However, I did feel completely at peace inside of the house."

1884045,53425020,2015-11-08,27898121,Antonia,"Sarah and her sister were welcoming and super kind hosts. Sarah waited for our arrival until 3:30 am and didn't complain once. The house is absolutely comfortable and the rooms nice furnished. There is free parking on the street, the city centre is approximately an hour away by foot. The stay with Sarah was incredible and I can only recommend her."
1884045,55313465,2015-11-29,33750833,Angela,Sarah gave me a warm welcome. I showed up late on Thanksgiving evening and she gave me a tour of where I would be staying  and we had a nice chat as well. The house was is a convenient location and the area has been built up quite a bit since the last time I was in Boston. The accommodation was exactly how it was described.
1884045,55759502,2015-12-05,50137367,J.,"A fantastic stay and excellent value! Sarah was very cordial and welcoming, and the location is convenient for accessing much of the region via public transport. Definitely I would recommend her place to other Boston travellers!"

1884045,60526927,2016-01-24,3997638,Leo,I am sorry to say that I had a terrible experience at Sarah's place. This was because:
1) The bedroom was so freezing cold on the first night that we couldn't sleep (the bedding was not warm enough),,,,,
2) The decor was dingy and there was a range of strange marks/smells,,,,,
3) The shower was cold on the second morning and never got any hotter,,,,,
4) Sarah was angry at us for not checking out until 12:30 instead of 12:00 and refused to keep our luggage until later in the afternoon!,,,,,
5) I tried to find Sarah to let her know about the water. I knocked but she didn't hear,then when I went in she was accused me of barging into her bedroom! (I had no idea what room it was),,,,
"My friend and I were shocked at how we were treated by Sarah. Avoid this place like the plague!\"",,,,,

1884045,64774455,2016-03-08,51745861,Faris,"We had a great stay with Sarah in Boston. The room is great, with two comfy beds and plenty of space. Bathroom and kitchen facilities were absolutely fine, and Sarah was kind enough to provide tea / coffee as well as other supplements for breakfast (e.g. peanut butter, jelly etc.)"
The house is around 10 minutes to the Dudley Square bus station,with access to downtown Boston normally 20-30 minutes depending on traffic. There is also easy bus access to other areas such as Harvard / Cambridge. There are also cafés and restaurants in the local area,by the bus station. The local area generally felt safe,but can feel a little desolate at night.,,
Overall Sarah was a great host and happy to assist us if we had questions or needed help. A great stay in Boston,"and highly recommended.\"",,,,
1884045,66133193,2016-03-19,5725903,Nas & Josh,"The room in Sarah's home was very clean and warm. I arrived a bit late and Sarah was more than accommodating. Only stayed for one night so unfortunately we didn't interact much, but would surely recommend Sarah's to other guests."
1884045,67289695,2016-03-28,53641337,Chih-Jung,I have great time staying at Sarah's house. She is kind and nice.
1884045,68322297,2016-04-04,1583742,Travis,Sarah's room is at the top of 2 narrow stairs which made it difficult for my mom to get up and down. Also the hot water was sporadic in the bathroom sink. Overall it was an adequate air Bnb experience but definitely no frills.
1884045,69316510,2016-04-10,19360082,Xiaochen,The place was very great!
1884045,69733588,2016-04-13,66678430,Safiye,"Sarah is a lovely woman and her son is so sweet! Nice simple room; lots of privacy. Easy access to major bus terminal. Short walk to Fenway/colleges area. 20-30 mins bus ride to Downtown. A much better alternative to a noisy, shared room at a hostel. I would stay with Sarah again."
1884045,72862070,2016-05-05,40980740,Chris,"Sarah, her son and sister are nice, friendly and open people. If they have time (they are busy persons) you can easy chat with them."
The sleeping room was proper,the beds were ok (not top).,,,,
Environment in bathroom simple but also ok.,,,,,
Only bed,doors and stairs were cracking,which may wake up others.,,,
Although we didn't speak eachother at entering as well as leaving,"it was pleasant to be at the house.\"",,,,
1884045,75604973,2016-05-22,27602667,Ursula,"Sarah is a very caring and welcoming host. Her house is very cosy and comfortable and the room is exacly as described. Sarah, her son and sister are all very friendly and helpful."
The area is very well connected with downtown Boston but it's not probably the safest to move around during the evening. During the day it's allright and busy.,,,,,
Thank you,"Sarah for everything! \"",,,,
1884045,77519800,2016-06-01,33573914,Andrea,"Sarah and her son were very friendly, and the room was just as it was described. I had plenty of space - there was even a microwave and fridge outside the room which was very useful. It was a comfortable, homely house."
My only concern about this listing is that I wasn't completely comfortable in the neighbourhood. It is a long walk to get to the T (the Boston metro) and the area is a bit rough. Nothing happened to me,"but some travellers might not like it.\"",,,,
1884045,77856762,2016-06-04,74672643,Lawrence,"First time in Boston, first time Air bnb user, Sarah made this a wonderful experience. The room is as cozy and comfortable as it looks, on the 3rd floor of a nice old house. Quiet street, only 5 minute walk to the bus station that can take you anywhere you need to go. You could not ask for a nicer or more gracious host than Sarah. Very smooth and easy experience. Would highly recommend."
1884045,78807352,2016-06-09,28396844,Ed,"Sarah was very welcoming, room and house is spacious. Short walk to Dudley Square bus station with buses to anywhere in the city."

1884045,81121278,2016-06-21,36804062,Sébastien,"Sarah's place was totaly in line with the description. She was very welcoming and took good care of us. The AC is very useful as the room is located right under the roof, but it is not too noisy. Fine offer given the low price."
"\"",,,,,
1884045,82150057,2016-06-26,8895329,Audi,"Sarah was very friendly and welcoming when we arrived. The room is on the 3rd floor and looks exactly like the pictures. The staircases are narrow and somewhat difficult to manage with luggage. It also got a little toasty in the room. There was a window AC unit but we never turned it on, not wanting to do so without asking (we didn't see Sarah much after checking in, we did a lot of sight-seeing and really only returned to the house to sleep). The room itself also does not lock from the outside. This was not a big deal for us, but to some people it may be. Overall I would recommend this place for a laid back travel party of 2 looking for a good value near the center of the city."
1884045,85693789,2016-07-12,77881651,Jesse,"Sarah was great, helped me communicate with my friend in Boston when I lost my phone. Very nicely put together house, and having the top floor with its own bathroom, mini-fridge, AC unit and microwave is a nice touch. Close to a bus station, and an inexpensive Lyft ride from Fenway."
1884045,86202202,2016-07-15,16789698,Stories Of Lisbon,"Sarah was a nice host and was flexible by letting us leave our luggage until end afternoon, until we had to go to the airport. That was very useful and we appreciated a lot that possibility."
However,we recommend that Sarah improves her offer. The room was not adapted for such hot days,with no AC nor ventilator in a top floor with bad isolation,being closed and not ventilated when we arrived. We had issues to sleep with the heat.,,
"The bathroom needed also better cleaning.\"",,,,,

1884045,88796865,2016-07-25,31485568,Kristy,"The neighborhood is beautiful and Sarah's place is easy to get to from public transit. She was very accommodating with our travel schedule. Not only were my friend and I able to leave our bags at her place (hours before check in), we were able to leave them after checkout since the flight home was not until late in the evening. This helped out a lot, not having to wheel around suitcases while sightseeing. Sarah is very warm and welcoming and the room is perfect for travelers who just need a place to rest."
1884045,89506240,2016-07-28,20748584,Michael,"Sarah and his family was nice. We hade a good time. The location is nice and clean. The room and the bathroom is located under the roof. The room has an AC which should run all the time, the bathroom is very hot without an AC."
1884045,91240358,2016-08-04,23751793,Reiner,Sarah wasn't there when I arrived but her son took great care of us. Room is exactly how described. Bus station to center was a short walk. Only one night but good experience. Recommended if you are travelling on a budget.

The high rise apartment was very nicely decorated,totally clean and furnished,very well managed. The bedroom had a large bed,all facilities needed,nice closets,large window with awesome view of the part of Boston from high rise. There was also great lounge area and accompanying open air area on top floor with another breathtaking view of Boston. This was the perfect kind of apartment I like.
The neighborhood also was superb! The building itself has a large food court (variety of cuisines,bar and grill and coffee shop) and a CVS store. The neighborhood is very very safe and totally inside the city. Lots of restaurants,movie theaters,etc. are all within reach. Perfect neighborhood and facilities.,,

Bernie is amazing. His first priority is making his guests feel the most comfortable and he will go to a huge extend in making your stay the most memorable and amazing one. He is kind,intelligent,hospitable and he has the heart for people. He is just like a father and makes sure that his guests gets the best during their stay here. He cares alot in a sense that he will offer to bring guests around if they're unfamiliar with the area and to explore their future endeavors if needed. Bernie is an amazing and generous host and if ever I'm back in boston,this place will definitely be first on my list. Highly recommended!,,
About the area:,,,,,
This area is so convenient and safe. There will be security guards on patrol. There was this once I was in the lift and ran into a security guard on duty,"making rounds to ensure that the building is safe for residents. Star market is just 10 minutes walk away. And there so many T stations around this place.  Super convenient!\"",,,,

6676364,44421830,2015-08-26,20535250,Sarah,"Nice apartment near Longwood station.  The two guest bedrooms share a private bathroom.  I was impressed with how well kept everything was and with all of the amenities.  I was provided with many towels, bottled water, various toiletries and a nice blowdryer.  The shower had great water pressure, and the bed was super comfy.  Many mirrors and a nice, big full length one in the hall.  I was able to use the kitchen as I would my own.  Laundry facilities in the building plus beautiful views from every room (it's on a higher floor).  The neighborhood felt safe and was populated mostly by people in scrubs and lab coats, which makes sense given the location.  My only frustration was with the elevator wait which is usually not long but occasionally there were hangups.  One day someone had reserved one of the two elevators for moving and I waited over five minutes for the only available elevator.  Then it stopped on so many floors it was nearly 10 minutes of my commute that morning just to deal with the elevator.  It is no big deal; I only mention this so that future guests can factor this potential into their commute time."
Finally,the host made me feel very at home and was kind.  He gave me maps and brochures too!  And lots of privacy,but at the same time very responsive when needed.  In other words,very balanced.  I enjoyed being his guest!,,
I highly recommend staying in this good,"clean place and will gladly return if I visit Boston again.\"",,,,

Bernie is so friendly and kindhearted. He prepared some body lotion, shampoo, a hair dryer and even a Chinese version of Boston travel book in my room. The bed is a comfortable queen size one. This is my first time to the U.S. This room makes me feel like at home. I will definitely recommend everybody to stay in Bernie's apartment."

The place is clean and tidy, and everything you need is right there. The place is close to public transport, but you could even walk to the center if you prefer. Apart from all this, having a food court in the building also doesn't hurt."

From the lock on the bedroom door to thetoiletries and extra shower mats to the temperature of the bedroom set to perfect sleeping temperature while the rest of the apartment is warm (you can adjust yourself too), Bernie makes certain his guests feel comfortable and welcome in every way. The place is comfortable, clean and beautiful and the location is a short walk from the T with pleasant walks to eating areas on Beacon street. I can't recommend Bernie enough! If I'm in the area again, this will be at the top of my list."
6676364,47248110,2015-09-17,173089,Priscilla,"Bernie was very accommodating to my extremely late arrival.  The plane was 5 hours overdue!  He greeted me at the street to let me in to the building and gave me all instructions despite the extremely late hour.   The room was very well set up with all I might need.   Similarly with the kitchen .  There were more facilities than I had need for, in fact.  The apartment is very close to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabelle Stewart Gardner Museum, so ideally located for me.  It is surrounded by medical institutions."

Harvard Medical, the Gardner Museum (which was incredible), the Boston Museum of FIne Arts, and the Green Line metro are all a 5-15 minute walk. Super easy, and that's saying something, as I arrived without knowing a thing about public transportation. In conclusion, Bernie rocks!"

The location was very clean,quite,safe and he provided all the amenities (except TV,which I did not need). Everything was high quality. Fan / air conditioning,internet,hotel like items (towels
The space was ultra quite. I didn't even realize there was a guest in another bedroom and Bernie had his space in another room. Even though we were all in the same apartment,I only saw the other guest once for 5 seconds,and I never saw Bernie after I checked in.,,,
The room had good quality door locks and secure access to the high rise building through the Gallery Food Court,which was ultra convenient!,,,,
Location is 1 block from major Harvard Medical facilities and about 1/4 mile to a train. Directions to Harvard Square: Green line (D) will take you Park Station,Switch to Red line to Alewife. Harvard Square is about 5 more stops. Train is about $3,or,a taxi costs about $15-$17.,,

The view was incredible and even more breathtaking from the common space on the top level of the building. I had a flatmate, but we never even ran into each other; having my own locked room felt more than safe and the bed was more comfortable than a hotel! The only negative thing was my own fault; it was warm in the apartment (almost 80), and I didn't sleep well but duh, there was a thermostat in my room I was too tired to notice until the morning!  Stay with Bernie. I will again!"

O prédio possui lavanderia no terraço e uma praça de alimentação no térreo com uma farmácia (CVS Pharmacy). Estação de metrô fica relativamente perto (7 min andando) e você pode ir pra qualquer lugar da cidade com ele. O Bernie é muito simpático e fica à disposição em caso de dúvidas. Valeu a pena!

This was my first experience staying in an AirBnB and I daresay that I will never again experience a host quite as warm,enthusiastic,"accommodating and charismatic as Bernie.

Bernie was very accommodating and friendly, also extremely responsive to texts, emails, and phone calls. I arrived early and he got the room ready for me as soon as he could, which I very much appreciated. The room was so quiet and peaceful (except for the Boston ambulances outside) and provided a great view of the Brookline area. The T is only a short walk from the building and tons of food options nearby. I highly recommend this room for a short visit to Boston alone or as a couple."
6676364,71770746,2016-04-28,63158434,Karina,"Great place to stay! Bernie was a kind, helpful, and professional host."
6676364,73159223,2016-05-07,28771633,Tawny,Bernie was an excellent host with superb hospitality. I can not say enough great things about this AirBNB experience. The room was in perfect condition and had a spectacular view. Bernie is very knowledgable and will do great things in the world. I'm fortunate that I had the opportunity to stay here and give it my high recommendations.
6676364,73298471,2016-05-08,3178666,Paul,"Close to the perfect place to stay. Bernie is a warm and congenial host who makes you feel immediately at home and goes out of his way to make sure you are taken care of. Apartment is clean, spacious and comfortable with upper floor views of the city. Situated in a lovely part of town between Fenway area and Brookline. Longwood green line station is a short walk away so It’s really easy to get around. Definitely making this my home base when I’m in town."
6676364,73829034,2016-05-10,47278699,Erik,Bernie gave me a tour of the building and the condo.  Very nice and luxurious.  Everything was as advertised and Bernie was a great host
6676364,74229187,2016-05-14,4888265,Cong,"Very nice place! Bernie was very friendly and patient during the checkin. The neighborhood is very convenient, close to Fenway and Museum of Fine Arts, lots of food and CVS. Bed is super comfortable and I really enjoyed the view from the big window!"

6676364,75366198,2016-05-21,25559017,Carol,"It was easy to meet up with Bernie, he showed me how everything worked such as keys and doors.  Each day he asked if I needed anything.  The apartment and room were very clean and comfortable.  He has all the amenities there: towels, soaps, etc.   I stayed for a week as it is a perfect location for events or anything you need to do near the Harvard medical center campus, Harvard school of public health, Children's, etc. It is near 2 metro stops.  I took the train and metro from the airport all the way to the apartment.  You share the apartment with one other guest but I never even saw the others and you have locks for all the doors, including your room."
6676364,75624470,2016-05-22,59973011,Ana,"Quiet location, close to everything. Bernie was a great host"
6676364,76070551,2016-05-24,65781387,Albert,"Bernie's place was great! Check in was simple. We met downstairs of Bernie's apartment, he gave me the keys, took me to his apartment, and pointed out the interesting places in the surrounding area. I was most impressed by the conditions of the room. It was just like the photo: tidy and immaculately clean with a comfortable full (or queen?) size bed. It was also very well stocked with towels, shampoo, soap, slippers, hair dryer, iron, bottle water, Kleenex, etc. The room had a lock and a door chain to ensure privacy. Overall it was a great experience for me."
6676364,76331047,2016-05-26,15643103,Erin,I arrived in Boston late and was greeted and showed my room promptly! I loved staying here!!  Everything I could have needed was available and more! I cannot rave enough about how great this stay was and what a great nights sleep I had. Highly highly recommend.
6676364,76763351,2016-05-29,57551249,Elizabeth,The listing description was accurate. Bernie was very accommodating. If I had any questions he answers them as well as shared some areas near the air b&b he thought I would enjoy.
The neighborhood is lovely and a quick walk to the D and E train lines,"and is close to a few of the buses. I recommend this listing if you ever get a chance to be in Boston. \"",,,,
6676364,77187141,2016-05-30,70489673,Cassandra,"Bernie was a fantastic host! We only stayed for one brief night, but the location was perfect for our outing near Fenway. He was kind, thorough and courteous, and the room and bathroom were clean and cozy! Many thanks for a great first Airbnb experience!"
6676364,77949804,2016-06-04,62262712,Ming-Yen,Bernie is exceedingly helpful as described in the reviews despite having a busy job. He had lots of advice and was quick to respond to queries. Generally a very enjoyable stay.

"I do recommend Bernie's place\"",,,,,
6676364,78404319,2016-06-06,7174883,Laura & Alexander,"Bernie's cozy high-rise was a well located, and perfectly stocked room for my short stay."
My private bedroom was filled with perks,and the bed was delightfully comfortable. The bathroom,kitchen,and other common areas which are shared were equally impeccable and fully stocked. Bernie was kind and communicative when telling me all about the space,what's available,how to access the balcony at the top of the building
The condo itself is located at the Longwood Galleries,which means you have convenient access to a CVS,a food court,coffee shops etc. right at the lobby level of your room virtually all day long. The shops and the public entrances close at 10 p.m.,of course Bernie provides you with everything you need to go in-and-out as you please.,
I would highly recommend Bernie's place for anyone needing a clean,safe,"and comfortable space for a short stay in Boston! \"",,,

6676364,81322121,2016-06-22,1150667,Michael,Very convenient stay. I arrived early (by overnight flight) and Bernie happily met me ahead of check-in with keys and a tour of the building. Location was excellent - walked down and caught a game at Fenway Park.
6676364,81561874,2016-06-23,60844877,Kyle,Bernie was very nice. He was gracious and flexible with us during the check in process; we were running behind and had to push back our check in. Place was a good location. Bed was comfy.
6676364,81937560,2016-06-25,54518857,Suzan,Bernie came and met me personally showed me and explained in detail where I was and what was available to me. I was only there for one night but because Bernie was so helpful I had a pleasant evening exploring Boston!
The room was well appointed and if it was a hotel you would give it 6 stars!,,,,,
"Would definitely stay again\"",,,,,
6676364,82211452,2016-06-26,29128828,Maria,Bernie was great. The apartment was clean and he was very nice. I would certainly stay there again.

6676364,84126576,2016-07-05,3968825,Andre,"Bernie is an excellent host, and I enjoyed my time there. The room is cozy and has a stunning view (I could see fireworks from the room on July 4). The location of the apartment is great and close to major locations. Overall I heartily recommend Bernie's place!"
6676364,84969484,2016-07-10,57932385,Rachel,We've stayed here before and loved it so when we arrived we knew where to go. Bernie was in contact the entire time. Very lovely.
6676364,85496550,2016-07-11,62445900,Julie,Bernie was fantastic. He showed us around the place and gave us fantastic suggestions on how to see Boston and what to see and what to eat.
6676364,86887500,2016-07-17,58940292,Mark,"Bernie was a great host and couldn't have been more gracious.  The room was as advertised and the location to Fenway was excellent.  Considering the price, it is a real deal.  Since we rented both rooms all was good and it made the shared bathroom acceptable.  I didn't know about the common space prior to renting."
6676364,87126467,2016-07-18,63844900,Mathew,Pretty nice !!!!
6676364,87388851,2016-07-19,44330454,Maria,"Bernie was a very welcoming and friendly host. He gave me all the info I needed to get from the airport to the accommodation and came to meet me when I arrived close to his place. He very generously took me for a walk around the neighbourhood at night so I could find some food. (I'd just flown in from London and was starving!) He even stuck the pizza in the oven for me while I took a shower! The room was very comfortable; just what I needed after a long journey and feeling jet lagged. I wasn't expecting anything for breakfast the next day but he provided some snacks and made coffee. Great host. Thanks, Bernie!"
6676364,88224089,2016-07-23,39866428,Anthony,"Bernie was an excellent host. He was the most professional host I've ever stayed with on Airbnb. Had tons of amenities for us like toiletries, sun screen, bottled waters, fresh towels, and the list goes on.. He wasn't able to meet us personally upon our arrival, and I think he was stressing more about it than we were.. Called me the night before, gave a very detailed instruction of what to do, even sent step by step pictures of what I'd see navigating his complex. I'd give him a 4.5 just because there were a few small oddities: the carpet and rugs didn't look too recently cleaned and the bathroom looked kind of like dorm bathroom (style, not cleanliness). Also, no trash can in the bathroom had my gf and I scratching our heads.. But other than that, exceptional service and he went way above the call for an Airbnb, especially at the price. Would HIGHLY reccomend."
6676364,89263377,2016-07-27,10930580,Susan,"Bernie met me when I arrived and was helpful throughout my four day stay. He was just the right level of helpful - available but respected my privacy. The listing is just as described. The apartment is very well stocked with needed items like shampoo, towels, ironing board and iron and I could go on and on. The wifi connection is also excellent. The building has accessible laundry facilities. The apartment and building are very secure and quiet and the location is central with a CVS and food court in the first floor of the building.  Bernie was a most welcoming and helpful host. I recommend his place to anyone."
6676364,89501036,2016-07-28,43023696,Tamara,"Friendly and helpful host, great location, comfy and clean room.  Enjoyed my stay!"
6676364,89670569,2016-07-29,81328483,Lynne,Bernie is very friendly and accommodating.  My arrival was a few minutes later than anticipated and he was gracious about the delay and settled me into the spot quickly.  He gave me a tour of the building to let me know important information and all went smoothly.
6676364,90942899,2016-08-03,86862227,Kyle,Super host is the perfect description of Bernie
6676364,91043757,2016-08-03,6740770,Stuart,"The room and bed were very luxuriously appointed, with the additional privacy of a lock on the bedroom door. Bathroom and kitchen were both very clean and well-stocked. I was only in Boston for one night, but would highly recommend this listing for a single traveller. It was a very safe, secure, comfortable apartment."
6676364,91242653,2016-08-04,14055877,Jorge,The room is very good. Everything as in the pictures. Bernie was very friendly and helpful. On arrival he gave me a little tour and explained to me all the necessary details. Overall a great experience.
6676364,92448000,2016-08-08,72524159,Homer,"This was my first Airbnb and didn’t know what to expect, but Bernie was very accommodating.  He had all the necessities.  He had fruit and water available, too bad I stuffed my face all weekend.  The bed was great, and the room has a great view.  The location was great as well, food court and CVS on the ground floor.  Walking distance (0.7 miles) to Fenway where Pearl Jam was playing and I’m still Alive!  Overall great experience, would stay again."
6676364,92662716,2016-08-09,24476956,Veerle,Bernie is a very kind host. The room was exactly what the discription said. Clean and comfortable. Communication with Bernie was smooth and made it easy to find the place. Thank you Bernie.
6676364,93576528,2016-08-13,63636827,Joseph,"Bernie was an excellent host. Pre-arrival he had contacted me to find out when I was likely to arrive to ensure there were no delays. I was given a full tour of the apartment and premises (laundry room, common space). The room was stocked with toiletries and towels and was thankfully air conditioned. Bernie even offered me coffee and fruit one morning before I headed out to do some sightseeing. He had the right balance between communication and providing privacy. Overall, a superb stay and I would not hesitate to stay here again."
6676364,94972249,2016-08-17,13123597,Pasquale,Bernie is a perfect host. Everything was perfect and he made me feel at home. I warmly suggest to stay at Bernie's apartment.
6676364,95564922,2016-08-20,21291380,Robin,"The room was very clean and cool (with its own AC unit), which was most welcome in the summer heat. We also had access to the top floor for an even better view of Boston. The building is a little complicated, and Bernie explained the different keys, doors, etc. to us when we first arrived...and had me try out the various keys and doors to be sure I understood. Bernie is a creative professional in the heart health field, and we enjoyed talking with him."
6676364,95962595,2016-08-21,32375384,Holger,Bernie was a great host. The apartment is easy to get to by public transport. Everything was very clean and the view from the apartment astonishing. I had a very good chat with Bernie. It was my first Airbnb experience and it was very good. I can definitely recommend this place.
6676364,96363964,2016-08-22,46822712,Feiyu,"The bed is soft and comfortable. The room is perfectly spaced and very clean. Also, the house has perfect location, which is located just beside Harvard Medical School."
6676364,96634357,2016-08-23,75857659,Andrew,"Bernie was the perfect host. He gave me a quick tour of the room and building when I arrived; showing me where the laundry room was and a very cool room with an amazing view at the top of the building. The room was spotless and had more amenities than I would have ever expected (towels, soap, shampoo, bottles of water, etc.). The room also had an A/C going, which was nice on a warm night. The location is right above the food court at the Galleria and in the heart of the Longwood Medical Area. I had business at Brigham and Women's for two days and it was the perfect location to spend the night in between and at a rate you will not even approach finding in the area. Couldn't have asked for a better stay at an incredible rate. Highly recommend."
6676364,97403244,2016-08-27,42424186,Jumee,"Perfect place to stay!  We stayed just a few days but would happily stay there for the more days. Bernie was super kind and helpful and location was perfect for us. Clean, easy to check-in. Perfectly arranged for a hospitality experience with enough towels and amenities in the apartment. Highly recommend."
6676364,97664461,2016-08-28,67354119,Craig,"Everything went well - good section of town, convenient food court located on the ground floor of the building, and close enough to walk to Fenway Park."
6676364,99542685,2016-09-05,14403392,Suchitra,Bernie picked me up from the lobby and escorted the apartment as sooon as I called and helped with my luggage. Showed me around and made me feel right at home!
6676364,99677235,2016-09-05,42286333,Brooke,Perfect room and comfy bed! I had everything I needed and more. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Thank you Bernie!

8439661,59568012,2016-01-12,31244128,Janan,The apartment is very nice and comfortable. I had a downside: the first day there was no electricity in one of the rooms but the next day  Will fixed it  We were 5  and we had a good time there. Excellent area!! . I would consider staying here on my next visit to Boston.
8439661,64926793,2016-03-09,256121,Kyle,"This place is in a great location in the South End - right off Washington St and close to some great restaurants. I stayed here while in town for work, and it was nice and quiet. The apartment offers the basics of what you need and is comfortable. Also, the roof deck has a fantastic view of the Boston skyline."
8439661,66161423,2016-03-20,16252282,Matthew,Everything was good. Nice place. Host was not around but instructions were good enough so that we were able to let ourselves in.  Gates didn't feel overly secure and the home is pretty bare.
8439661,70706870,2016-04-19,27564046,Jeff,"Just landed in Boston on Sunday to run the Marathon and I got a text from my host that there was an issue with the apartment and they had to cancel my stay. I was frantic because I was traveling with my daughter and knew that finding a place was near impossible the day before the marathon. Will answered my inquiry pretty quickly and approved my stay immediately. It was only a few blocks away from where we were left stranded by my previous host. The place was perfect, big and beautiful. Will had it cleaned immediately and allowed us to drop our things by so I could get to the Marathon Expo. Great location, great accommodations and, although we never met, Will was very accessible and rescued us from our evil previous almost host."
8439661,76185246,2016-05-25,22307380,Simon,"The apartment is modern and as posted on the website. The location was great too! The owners though, weren't responsive to our questions. And instructions weren't clear enough."
8439661,77534007,2016-06-01,64179812,Sharon,"The apartment is exactly as pictured. There were 6 of us and we had ample space, and the rooftop deck was very enjoyable!  Super comfortable beds!  We did not meet the host, but the management company was very responsive and helpful.  It is up 4 flights of stairs, but worth it, just an fyi!  Nice guidebook with lots of helpful information to the surrounding area.  Easy walk to some wonderful food!"
8439661,78475137,2016-06-06,61469570,Shilpa,Great large place. Located in a nice neighbourhood that wasn't too busy. There were many cute restaurants and cafes in the surrounding area.
2915643,39645524,2015-07-25,32217512,Najwa,The host canceled this reservation 34 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9299923,64796872,2016-03-08,53594388,Agathe,"Logement très agréable et surtout parfaitement placé ! Immeuble très sécurisé, beau standing. L'agence est joignable et donne de bons renseignements. Parfait pour découvrir la magnifique ville qu'est Boston!"
9299923,66080631,2016-03-19,50779557,Sara,The communication was excellent and the apartment was as decribed. It is in a fantastic location for walking to most tourist spots and close to various eateries. I would stay here again.
9299923,68314700,2016-04-04,53635042,Catherine,"The bright and cheerful condo was very clean and neat, with recently updated kitchen and bath.  It only took me a few minutes to figure out that the microwave is also a small oven, which was great for pizza. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils and dishes. There was coffee, tea, oil, dishwasher detergent, paper goods, etc, and a toaster.  The blender includes a small smoothie cup, too."
If you don't want to cook,there is a good sushi/Japanese restaurant right next door (nice prices) which also delivers,and next to it a well-stocked convenience store with a decent wine selection as well as sandwiches,fresh eggs,etc.  There are a variety of restaurants within a short distance: lunch,deli
The bath was well-supplied with personal items.  If you want washcloths,you might want to bring them,but you will have nice fluffy towels and bathmat provided.,,,
The bed was comfy and well supplied with extra pillows and blankets in one of the closets.  There is ample closet space and a nice little dressing area.  A new iron and ironing board are provided,and a hairdryer.,,,,
If you are not an urban person used to traffic,remember that you are conveniently in the center of Boston.  Earplugs may be necessary at night,but that's an easy solution if you need absolute quiet to sleep.,,,
The apt has a limited view of the north end of the Boston Common to check the weather,and is only a quick walk to several T stops.  You can take the red line from South Station,then walk a block to the condo,or you can grab an Uber or taxi easily.  21 Beacon is right next to the State House,the Atheneum,the Freedom Trail
The wireless here is good and dependable,and HDMI and network cables are thoughtfully provided. There's not great task lighting if you are doing desk work,but the couch is a comfy place to sit with your laptop.,,,
The concierge team are helpful and welcoming and helped communicate with the local Flatbook manager about a fee confusion,which was resolved promptly and satisfactorily.  I met a member of the local Flatbook team when I was checking out,and she cheerfully helped with the key return.  The concierge doesn't arrive until noon on Sundays,so if you are checking out then,make arrangements with Flatbook to return the keys.  It all worked out just fine for me.,
I'll definitely stay here again.  The location and convenience,clean,bright setting,and good communication made my stay pleasant.  As I left,"a team was getting ready to install new local art in the condo.  Sorry I missed seeing that!\"",
9299923,69540303,2016-04-11,55430840,Annie,The apartment was exactly like the pictures! It was clean and cozy and perfectly located in a safe neighborhood. Only thing is that the heaters kick on when they want to as there is no knob to change the thermostat.
9299923,70651766,2016-04-19,34012915,Ibere,"Great location, close to the most important historic sites (right at the Freedom Trail)."
Nice and clean space,equiped kitchen,good shower,"comfortable bed. And Flatbook team is totally helpful!\"",,
9299923,74151816,2016-05-13,25185095,Jeremy,"Excellent apartment, super clean and well located. Flatbook team very responsive too. Will re-apply next time I visit Boston!"
9299923,75175534,2016-05-19,645276,Edward,Great.
9299923,76023150,2016-05-24,2364897,Ivan,"We arrived late, outside of the typical check-in time. Flatbook is very accommodating, having a local property manager contact us and help us check in"
9299923,76308396,2016-05-26,7879398,Andreina,"The apartment couldn't be more perfect! It's located right in the middle of Boston, near the major attractions and the subway, and it's fully equipped and super clean.  If we return to Boston we'll definitely stay here!"
9299923,77520570,2016-06-01,29993888,G,"Our stay was a great experience. The location is wonderful-adjacent to the Boston Commons, the State Building, the T, the Italian Quarter and the Charles River. Best to not have a car if you are staying here, unless you are prepared to pay $40-50/day for garage parking. The apartment was spotless, everything tidy and the essentials well supplied. Comfortable bed. The 24/7 support answered my questions when they arose. My one caution is that while the location is great, it is on a busy street that has a lot of large trucks traffic. Light sleepers might be bothered by the noise."
9299923,77901252,2016-06-04,37328025,Chris,"Fifth floor condo (2 elevators) in an excellent location, exactly as pictured and easy check-in/check-out with the front desk."
The kitchen was fantastic,coffee maker,kettle,blender,toaster and all necessary essentials for cooking on the stovetop. Roche Bros. and Whole Foods are within easy walking distance for groceries. The Internet was fast,tv was nice and the bathroom was clean (and surprisingly large). The bed was comfortable and the condo had plenty of space.
The condo was located at the corner of Boston Common next to the new state house (across the street from a Dunkin Donuts,but if you've been to Boston you know the DD density is higher here than anywhere in the world). The location is lively without being loud. We walked everywhere,the Hynes Convention center area is 15-18 minutes through the common and the public garden and the waterfront/north end is 10 minutes in the other direction. The only place I'd say walking would be a bear would be to Harvard.,,,
Don't hesitate,"this place is great. \"",,,,
9299923,79968676,2016-06-15,3817880,Jeff,Place was just as described.  Great location just off Boston Common.  Safe building with a concierge.  Would stay here again.
9299923,80441249,2016-06-18,3860053,Uluwehi,"This location was convenient for first time visitors to Boston area. It is 3 minute walk from the nearest station, and even closer to many of the stops on Freedom Trail. There is a DnD across the street and a convenience store downstairs.

It is in a great location very near to anything you need for a wonderful stay in Boston. It is within easy walking distance to great restaurants, shops, transportation, Boston Commons, downtown, etc.. Cara was a great host. She was easy to communicate with and made us feel welcome and comfortable with the stay. Thank you Cara!!!"
8782592,71445072,2016-04-25,33798795,Claire,"My family and I really enjoyed staying in Cara's apartment. It's located conveniently to access public transport while two public parks, the riverside, all major sights and grocery stores are within walking distance. Besides this, the stylish but very cosy apartment made us feel like home. Cara was there for all our questions and requests which made the organization of our trip super convenient."

It was so clean and the mattresses were incredibly comfy. The location was fantastic with lots being in walking distance and the T being just at the end of the street. What a great experience!!! I hope you'll have us again as we are thinking of a part 2 girls trip in the future!
8782592,84342054,2016-07-06,54448641,Robert,"Overall this is a good property in a great location. Whilst not Cara's fault, there are a few things that her landlord needs to fix, including leaky toilets, noisy air-conditioning and sub-standard electrical wiring and power points throughout. The location in the midst of Beacon Hill is ideal, being very close to Charles St, and just a few blocks from the T station."

I felt warmly welcomed by Sarah and her brother, who lives here as well, and all my needs were provided for with touching kindness and care. They are lovely people; Sam even walked me to the bus/train station and stayed until I'd found the right bus for Cambridge! It's a nice neighborhood close to the heart of city and imminently walkable to and from if you're up to it, and the T and buses are pretty easy and close. My room was very private, clean, and QUIET (except for some Logan Airport action overhead in the morning). You can lock your stuff up here with no worries. They offered me meals as well, and I felt very at home and welcome in every way."
This was the perfect overnight bed for me - affordable,comfy,close to where I needed to be,easy in and out,free parking,with great hospitality and no hassles or anything unexpected. I'd be happy to stay here again
1850260,8825038,2013-11-19,9875248,Lee,"The room was great and Sarah was a lovely host.  The room is on the third floor of the house and is very private. It was spacious, clean, had a great closet, tv and a desk. The house is a few blocks from a main bus terminal which led directly into Boston and Cambridge.  I will traveling to the area again and plan to book with Sarah each time."

I received a warm and informative welcome and then was provided space to be on my own. It was a lovely home with easy parking and I sincerely enjoyed meeting Sarah and her family.

They were very helpful during my stay as I was visiting someone in the hospital and even took an interest in the situation.  I had trouble with my cellphone and they helped me find a store to get it handled.  It’s a nice room on the 3rd floor.  The floor is tile and not wall-to-wall carpet which is a plus for those with allergies.  The room looks as it is in the photograph.
1850260,10012659,2014-01-25,8913426,Aravind,This is my second time staying at sarah's place. I had no trouble checking in and out and the room was clean and comfortable as always.

She met me with a big hug and smile, made sure I was fed and could get around the city no problem, and when I wasn't too tired we enjoyed some excellent conversation. The room was clean and comfortable just as advertised. I'd highly recommend staying with Sarah-she's just a delight."
1850260,11719049,2014-04-13,12991198,Tinco,"Staying with Sarah and her family was a lovely experience. The accommodation is nice and tidy, the location is safe and very convenient(3 mins' walk to Dubley Sta., and well connected to transfer points from airport). Above all, Sarah is a very caring and inspiring lady, and her family shares such feature. I even had a chance learning African gumbo soup and tasted it with Sarah. The  I will definitely stay with Sarah for another time on my visit to Boston in the future."
1850260,11741977,2014-04-14,8300713,Rachel,"When I arrived, Sarah was not actually around as she had just stepped out, but I was instead greeted by her little son who was absolutely adorable and showed us around to our room. :) So cute. The room was pretty much as described; I think what was provided for the price was fair. Toilet needs to be jiggled a little in order to flush but we figured it out pretty quickly; it's not broken or anything. The blankets provided were thin but the room itself was warmer than it was outside so we actually needed to pull out the mini-fan (provided in the closet) more than we needed the blanket, haha. When I did finally get to meet Sarah, she greeted me and my boyfriend so warmly and with a big hug! My only regret is that my schedule was so tight that I didn't have much time to sit around and have a chat with everyone there... Would recommend this room to anyone who is looking to stay in Boston on a budget! The location is very convenient too; I didn't take any public transportation but using Uber, I was able to get where I needed to be in less than 20 minutes and for less than 10 dollars!"
1850260,11954781,2014-04-20,3633997,Steev,"Comfortable 3rd floor bedroom within a short walk to stores & public transport. The hostess and her family are very friendly & welcoming. Street parking is available 6 pm to 8 am right out front, but not during the day."
1850260,12348034,2014-04-29,2280297,Daniel,"Sarah was a wonderful and accomodating host.  She and her family are very friendly and welcoming as I conversed with Sarah, her younger brother, and even her son at times during my trip and definitely enjoyed my stay in Boston, MA, despite the cold rainy weather.  I accidentally booked my stay 1 day too short and Sarah took care the reservation adjustment for the extra last day without any troubles. The 3rd floor room (2 are available) has its own bathroom and is comfortable.  It is easy to come and go as you please. The home is a short walk to public transport (Dudley bus station is only 3 blocks away).  I initially took a taxi to her place, but changed to public transportation or Uber after the airport taxi driver over charged me according to my host.  I was in town for a medical conference at the the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (BCEC) and found the best route was to walk 5 mins to Dudley Station and take a 5 min bus ride to Ruggles Train Station, which only cost $2.  Then I took the MBTA subway for $2.50 to the BCEC (orange route N to [at downtown crossing stop] red route S to [at south station stop] silver route W [exited to BCEC at World Trade Center stop).  The duration of walk/bus/subway route was on average 30 to 45 mins.  When I was in a hurry, I used Uber instead and it costs $9 on average and took 10 to 15 mins."
1850260,12459081,2014-05-03,8717252,Shari,"Sarah and her brother Sam were so warm and friendly. The room was very comfortable and had everything I needed! Sarah and Sam were always available for assistance with directions, even walked with me to hail a cab and show me where the bus stop was located! Just visiting at the end of the day having a good conversation with them was a pleasure! I very much enjoyed their hospitality and look forward to seeing them again!"
1850260,12627789,2014-05-06,8540240,Naiomi,"The room was as pictured and described. Sarah and her family warmly received us and made sure we felt welcome. The room was clean and comfy with windows that could open easily. The room is on the third floor so it was warmer than outside, but opening the windows really helped. I was in and out most of the time and didn't spend much time with Sarah or her family but they were very accommodating to ensure our stay was as promised. The condo is 2 short blocks from the Dudley Station making it easy to access public transport."

I'm sure Sarah and Sam are nice people,but the location of this space is questionable. Buyers beware - you get what you paid for.,,,,
Location - this house is located at the Dudley Square Silver Line T stop (which is a BUS,no trains are close to this location). It's a dead end bus stop - as grim as it gets. Smelly,dirt and trash everywhere...homeless people. Is this really the heart of Boston?,,,
Neighborhood - about a 3 block walk,it's not the  cleanest and a bit (URL HIDDEN) 11:30 am on a Thursday morning,people are hanging out in front if their houses (no jobs?),thumping music,loud conversations that are clearly heard even once you are inside the house.,
Sam met us - he was nice. Showed us around the house. Took us to our room. Room/bed exactly as pictured. Nothing more,nothing less.,,,,
The location and neighborhood just wasn't for us. We rented a hotel room,ordered a cab to pick us up at the house and took off. The remainder of the trip was great,Boston is a neat city!,,,
Good luck!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1850260,13156073,2014-05-20,14101914,Kaitlyn,Sarah was a great host who made sure you had everything you needed. Location is close to some bus stops which will connect you to the subway - we decided to park in the Back Bay area for the day instead. Free parking on the street on the weekends until 8am on Monday.
1850260,13346346,2014-05-26,44502,Linda,What was your experience with the host?
Sarah and her brother,Sam,are very warm and loving hosts.  Made us feel incredibly welcome and were very helpful.  Sarah's son is an absolute delight.  Sam brought our luggage upstairs for us!  They have a small fridge just for guests,and provided basics for making breakfast.,,
Was the listing what you expected?,,,,,
The room (spacious) is almost exactly as pictured - in addition there is a computer desk and chair which are not shown (a big plus).  Another plus is that there are easily accessible electric outlets.  The closet is huge,with lots of hangers and plenty of space for luggage.  Because Sarah and Sam are from Nigeria,they are accustomed to a very warm climate,so they keep the house warmer than is typical in the US.  That said,our room had two windows which could be easily opened to cool down the room (that did make it a bit noisy at times).  The bed was good.,
What was their neighborhood like?,,,,,
This was the only negative.  While I never felt unsafe (realize,however,that I grew up in Oakland,CA),the neighborhood is border line.  Starting before 5 pm and lasting into the wee hours there were a group of men that gathered at the curb in front of the apartment.  They were not intrusive or obnoxious,but one did have to walk between them to enter or exit the apartment.

"Thanks.\"",,,,,
1850260,14294897,2014-06-16,15146242,Belinda,"(I'm not native english, sorry for the mistakes)"
Sarah is a very nice host. We arrive earlier and have been nicely welcomed by his soon who is nice and showed us everything. The room is very big with a hude closet and the bathroom is just next,it's situated in the 3rd floor.,,,,
Big TV,bed is comfy,nothing bad too say; Same for the bathroom. Clean house,,,
The district is close from downtown by bus (i would say 10/15min); The area in itself is good,safe,people are outside on chairs,very cool. South end is a very nice district and you can reach it walking,5min,a lot of restaurants
What we preferred in total was Sarah and her family,they are all very welcoming,warm people,we had the chance to have a good conversation with them,they truly like receiving people and it was a pleasure for us meeting them.,
Sarah et sa famille sont des personnes très accueillantes et chaleureuses,La chambre est simple mais satisfaisante d'autant plus qu'il y a beaucoup d'espace. La maison est propre et le quartier animé mais safe et agréable (maison colorées,musique,"les personnes assises devant les maisons...). Je recommande cet endroit surtout pour Sarah son accueil. Se trouve à 10/15 minutes en bus du centre. A voir: south end qui se trouve à 5minutes à pied et le quartier en lui même mérite une balade.\"",,
1850260,14380249,2014-06-17,5378761,Shivani,"Sarah was a wonderful host to us. My boyfriend and I were only visiting for one night, but needed to leave our suitcases in the place during the following day. She was very flexible with us!"
The place was great too. She 'upgraded' our room to a king-size bed. It was very comfortable,and we had everything we needed.,,,,
The location is a little further from all the 'touristy' places in Boston,but it was extremely easy to get to/from there,from downtown,or Harvard/MIT,or even the airport. The main bus line ends just a few short blocks from her place,which means we were able to catch a bus to basically anywhere from there.
All in all,great experience,"and would definitely consider staying there again!\"",,,
1850260,14459808,2014-06-19,16928263,Ruben,"Great person, fast response. Basic room. Good price! A little noisy outside the house, so bring earplugs."
1850260,14565094,2014-06-22,2995203,Lisa,"Sarah and her family were very warm and welcoming. The room is just as it appears in the photo. I stayed three (3) nights for a conference I was attending  downtown. However, this room and location are not for everyone who needs a place to stay in Boston."
First,the room is on the third floor and requires walking up two flights of steep steps once inside the home. This could be problematic if a person has trouble with steps or has a heavy suitcase to lift.,,,,
Second,there was no air conditioning on in the home and the room was very hot at night. Although there was a fan and the window was open,it was still warm at night. This was mid-June.,,,
Third,the sheets and bedspread were made out of a slippery polyester type of material that made me sweat at night. I would have preferred cotton sheets and cotton pillow cases.,,,,
Fourth,(and most important for me) was that I am not used to city living. I returned from conference between 9-11pm and there were always people socializing in the courtyard in front of the front door. This made me nervous as I got out of my taxi (Uber). Nothing bad happened but I was not comfortable going out at night in that neighborhood.,,,,
In sum,if you need an affordable place to stay just a short bus or Uber ride to downtown,"you may want to consider this location.\"",,,

However, if you plan on walking, the location of their place was less than ideal for seeing downtown Boston. Also, their neighbors were extremely loud throughout the night and it was pretty hot in the top floor room with no AC – together, this made it difficult to sleep."

Our room was one of three that Sarah lists on airbnb,and there was a very international flair to her guests and her home.  We enjoyed our all too brief interactions with everyone we met.  Sarah's apartment building is in easy walking distance to the Dudley Station (served by buses),and connections to other buses and to the subway system was easy.  The neighborhood is residential,and townhouses were colorful,neat and clean.  The accommodations in the apartment were clean and comfortable.

I spent two good night with my friend there. The location of Sarah's house is near the bus station to downtown and the airport. There were parties during the weekend around the neighbourhood, so it was a bit noisy, but maybe the trip was too tired for me and my friend, so that did not bother us too much. Plus, the neighbourhood was very friendly and willing to help also."

They were very accommodating and allowed us to check in very late (thanks again!) They provided us with water, coffee and a few items for breakfast. As other visitors have noted, there isn't a/c but thankfully the fan was sufficient."
The only drawback to this listing is its location. If I wasn't traveling with my SO,I wouldn't have felt comfortable staying there. As a woman,I would have been concerned about the shady looking men that loitered around and being so close to several poorly maintained public housing projects. I wouldn't recommend this place to any of my friends but if your comfortable with staying in such a neighborhood and you're street smart,"you'll be fine.\"",,

Leider feierten die Nachbarn an einem Dienstag wieder sehr laut und lange,so dass schlafen kaum möglich war. Die Wände sind insgesamt sehr hellhörig und wenn alle drei Zimmer vermietet sind wird es sehr eng.,,,,

1850260,20013124,2014-09-22,18425392,Normand,"My experience at Sarah's house was great. The room was very spacious and clean with a very comfortable bed. The neighbourhood is not the greatest, but not bad either. The proximity to the Duduley bus terminal is a very strong point."

Sarah Egbusi There was a very nice house and room keys waiting for me just in time. Relationship with Sarah was on the phone and met. I recommend this place,"just efficient and accessible public transportation\"",,,,
1850260,22271875,2014-11-02,22549892,Simon,"It is a shame that I don't really have a chance to live in Sarah's place. I was on a trip to visit my father's best college friend in Boston, and he insisted that I stay at his place for that night. It was already quite late in the night, so I have to send Sarah a message that I can't make it. Anyway, she was nice and didn't blame me much. Hope we can have another chance to meet."
1850260,22467140,2014-11-07,22685705,Taty,"Although i did not see Sarah and Sam too much, they provided a nice quiet stay with easy access to the downtown Boston area. Good neighborhood."
1850260,22642072,2014-11-11,5801851,Riccardo,"I had booked the room for the period between november 7th to november 11th for myself. Later I had to change my reservation from nov 6 to nov 10 and add a guest with me. Sarah and Sam (her brother) have immediately been at our disposal. So, the other guest has simply paid an extra price, as it is right, and everything was ok."
When arrived in Boston we phoned Sam and he has come to South Station to pick us up by his car and show us the house.  Actually it was a house in Moreland Street and then he told us that we could stay there or going to Bethune way. I talk about the house in Moreland Street and have to say that it is very large,very comfortable,very safe,very well heated (it's up to us to choose the temperature,) very quiet. We can use the kitchen,the extra large bathroom
On Sunday I saw Sarah in the house and she was very very sweet and kind.,,,,,
There is absolutely no problem with this house and with these people. So,i would suggest everyone to choose them.,,,,
I read other reviews and someone worries about the location,though. Well. By walking 500m south you arrive to Dudley Station,where some useful buses start: for example the 1 to Harvard Square,the sl4 and sl5 to South Station and Downtown crossing,the sl1 to the airport. In only 15minutes by bus you are in the centre of Boston.,
"That's it. I only have to rethank Sarah and Sam because my joruney in Boston was very beautiful even because their house was it.\"",,,,,
1850260,23084513,2014-11-22,23824838,Michael,"Sarah greeted me into her home with a hug. It was her and her son. She was extremely friendly and curtious, a real sweet heart. House is in a neighborhood that seemed safe, even walking at night. Some night time neighborhood music noise. 5 min walk to Chinese food, joes famous subs, corner grocer. 10 minute walk to Boston medical center. Sarah and her son are both kind souls and you will surely feel welcome into her home, you are treated like a visiting friend rather than a tenant. I will surely go back if I am in the area in need of lodgings again"
1850260,23257001,2014-11-26,23434690,Lehaz,Large and clean room in the center of Boston. Sarah is very kind and easygoing person.

1850260,23620937,2014-12-06,13738900,Duy,Sarah & Sampson were amazing & truly became friends of mine! Sarah assisted me with various options and was very flexible in my accommodation needs! It is my intent to stay here again in the future! They are both very ethical and simply sweet people!
1850260,23984299,2014-12-15,22828347,E,Parking was easy and adjacent to the buildings and saw host once. Sarah and her son have a graceful demeanor.
The only coffee was instant decaf-with-milk premix. Bfast is bread and jam. Had to get my own bath soap: The only bath soap were a couple of used bars and there was no hand soap.  Toiletries needed restocking.,,,,,
The room and bed were spacious,on its own floor,with a door lock.,,,
The neighborhood was noisy: yelling at night and music from neighbors echoed clearly through closed windows/door.  If you're a heavy sleeper: not an issue.,,,,,

The bedroom was really nice, I could watch TV in the evening right before going to bed! I found that the wifi signal wasnt't very strong, but I'm note sure if it's a problem with my cellphone or Sarah's wifi. The bed was so comfortable! Bread, milk and orange juice was provided as part of the 'bed and breakfast' with was really nice because you usually don't have time to go grocery shopping before checking in! There is a bus station/terminal literally five minutes away, that was truly useful. I'll definitely check Sarah again if I ever come back to Boston! - Eleonore"

The room was nice and the bed was very comfortable, and I was very happy I stayed there. It's a bit away from, say, Boston Common; however, Uber rides to (URL HIDDEN) 120 Tremont Street, for example, are only about $10 and they come within five minutes. Again, Sarah is a lovely person and you will feel very welcome at her place."

The room itself was very comfortable and clean. I usually have trouble sleeping away from home,but the bed was so comfortable that I always woke up refreshed.,,,,
There's not much to do around the neighborhood itself,but it's a short bus ride from the town center. Around 10 to 15 mins.,,,,
Highly recommend it.,,,,,

The place is fine but If you are a person extremely strict about cleanness like my self, I felt uncomfortable in this place. I think it's so important to provide white linens and towels. I feel very uncomfortable sleeping in a place with dark color linens when the place is use by many different people."

The room was a great size with a king size bed, walk in wardrobe and a big TV. The bathroom was fine and right next to our room like an en suit. The house is a two minute walk to the bus station which is really useful as you can get to basically anywhere you  want to go from there. Overall, we had a very enjoyable time staying at Sarah's and she was very kind and helpful host."
1850260,34953840,2015-06-14,30407839,Francesco,"I really liked my time spent at sarah's. She was very kind and welcoming to me all the time. The listing is accurate and the neighborhood is a quiet place, people always greets you on the street and the location is very well served by bus/metro/public service, any time of the day. In 20min you can get pretty much wherever you want in Boston. The room is big, the bed is comfortable, the furniture very essential but it's ok! Both my room and the guests bathroom were clean. One thing I really appreciated is the flexible level of privacy: if you want to chat a bit you can typically reach to Sarah in the living room, otherwise you can just lock yourself in your room. Sarah is very professional in that. Overall, I would choose Sarah again for a future trip in Boston! Thank you."

The neighborhood didn't seem like the safest at night but it was nice during the day. Sara was very welcoming and we had a nice conversation. I might plan on bringing you own breakfast or going out though because there is not a big selection. It was about a $30 can ride from the airport and $10 to downtown.
1850260,36208101,2015-06-26,34868756,Zwelakhe-Duma,"Was so delighted to stay at Sarah's establiment. The room was just as pictured, very clean, very spacious, very organized. Sarah, is so helpful and welcoming, as always on call for support at anytime."
1850260,36876402,2015-07-02,33624136,Bram,"So first of all, Sarah's great and she really wants you to be comfortable. I had no problems at all during my stay and was even pleasantly surprised a few times by her hospitality. All the default things you would get in a hotel you also get here and if you want either privacy or a bit of a chat, both are fine with her. She's very open minded and I think we had a few nice talks about a broad range of subjects."
If you are looking for a place to stay in Boston for a short period I would definitely recommend Sarah,the price to 'what you get' ratio is very good and it is close to bus connections going downtown.,,,,
If you are hesitant about booking (like I myself was) stop being hesitant and go for it,"you won't be dissapointed!\"",,,,
1850260,37026407,2015-07-03,37255028,Gabe,Sarah was one of the nicest people I have ever met. She greets you with the warmest hug you will ever receive in your entire life. Make sure to take the taxi for the first time there.

The room is as described. We visited Boston on early August so the weather was pretty humid. The room had a big fan and I guess we were not used to the Boston humidity in the season so we had a hard time the first night. When we shared our experience with her she gave us a portable AC unit that really saved us.,,,,,
We did not quite liked the neighborhood but I heard from her that she is moving away in a few days so that shouldn't be a problem any more.,,,,,

Sarah accommodated my request to use the washer,this helped a lot as I had been travelling for quite a while.,,,,
There was coffee,milk,cereal for breakfast but I didn't use as I was in a hurry.,,,
The only downside to this was that it felt a bit overpriced for the location,"$10-15 less would've been perfect...\"",,,,

The accomodations were a bit less than we expected, due to the fact that Sarah just moved and the rooms weren't fully ready, we knew only a few days beforehand that it would be a different adress than the one we saw on the site. In that aspect it's not so nice to still pay the same amount, but Sarah really did her very best to get things in order as quickly as possible. We were offered breakfast if we wanted and she was also very helpfull getting us a taxi when we needed to get to the airport."

She had moved to a new address after I had booked my trip with her but she was very professional and made sure she gave me advanced notice of the new address prior to my arrival. Her home is very large and clean. I only had an opportunity to speak with her upon my arrival but she and her son seem very lovely. Regarding the room: very clean, fresh towels and quiet. The neighborhood is fine and you will be safe. She is a close walk to major buses. The only two issues I had were that there was no wifi available during my stay so if you don't have a smartphone this is something to consider.  The second, was the upstairs shower works very well and has hot water but the pressure is very strong so be careful to not get the floor wet. However, I highly recommend this home as a place to stay! Thank you very much Sarah!"
1850260,47286828,2015-09-17,35860048,Basil,Sarah has a lovely home which is easily accessible to the rest of the city. One bus and you are in the downtown area by the common.

I arrived rather late and the host waited up to meet me. She made sure to go through everything with me even though it was very late night. Parking was convenient - right outside.

1850260,48889953,2015-09-29,4825805,Anne,Sarah was warm & welcoming. Her newly renovated rented home is spacious and comfortable. Kitchen facilities were excellent. The only negative was the two spiral staircases we had to climb to our room on the 3rd floor. The bedroom was spacious and the bed comfortable.  We had the bathroom to ourselves which was nice but the toilet seat was very loose. Sarah will have this attended to. The home was located close to public transport for Downtown and there is an excellent supermarket within walking distance.

It took 20-30 minutes by silver line to get to the city center where the attractions are. The neighborhood is ok at day time, but one should not walk home alone after dark since it is pretty deserted. WiFi is good and fast. I did not talk much to Sarah but she seemed nice. One thing that can be improved is to provide the directions to the place with public transport."

The room is large and has an air-conditioning unit (which I didn't need) and an overhead fan. The bathroom is also large and I shared it with another Airbnb guest. If you are travelling by car there is plenty of parking space on the street. The apartment is located several miles from the downtown tourist attractions but is well served by buses at the nearby bus station which provide destinations for subway stations. There are machines at the bus station where you can buy 1-day \"\"Charlie\"\" tickets.\""
1850260,51726257,2015-10-24,43066270,Christopher,Sehr nette Gastgeberin. Zimmerbeschreibung hat sehr gut gepasst. Zimmer und Bad waren sehr sauber. Die Dusche war für deutsche Ansprüche allerdings in einem dürftigen Zustand (selbstgebaut?). Insgesamt kann ich das Zimmer nur weiterempfehlen.
1850260,51961640,2015-10-25,2802044,Gernot,Very friendly and nice hosts! Clean and comfortable room; I can really recommend this place.
1850260,52439168,2015-10-29,46630225,Luke,What a great first air BnB experience! Sarah made my stay comfortable and her house was within 15 minutes of the convention center. I would highly recommend staying here.
1850260,53023871,2015-11-03,46291011,Tahsin,"The son greeted me, I was expecting Sarah but thats fine. Very sweet kid showed me around. Met Sarah later, she was also nice. The room was fine for the price, a little hot but cleared up with ceiling fan. You have bathroom to yourself if no one else is renting the other room on this floor. Overall the room was fine."
BUT the neighborhood was really sketchy. I did not feel safe walking around during the day,"would not even think of going out during the night. I had a car so I felt somewhat safe that I could just go back and forth to my car at least. I didn't check out public transport. Wouldn't mind coming back to this host's service but only if in another safer neighborhood!\"",,,,
1850260,53201210,2015-11-06,21822681,Ahmed,"Sarah was very helpful and welcoming. I really felt like i was home, though i was far away from home."
1850260,53798773,2015-11-12,48601742,Olivia,Sarah was a wonderful host! I felt welcome the moment I walked into her home and she let me know everything I needed right away. The room and bathroom were so clean and the bed was nice and comfy :)
"It was great to talk to Sarah when I came in each night; she definitely creates a welcoming atmosphere! Thanks so much Sarah.\"",,,,,
1850260,54358323,2015-11-18,46803574,Patrick,"Bon accueil, bon échange malgré la barrière de la langue. Sarah a su réagir la deuxième nuit à un problème  de chauffage dans la chambe la première nuit."
1850260,55704454,2015-12-04,30546141,Mark,"Everyone made me feel so welcome. Good people! It's a joyful house. Magical. Musical. And the conversations in the kitchen, very international, very savvy."

"Sarah kind enough to drive us to hire car place one morning\"",,,,,
1850260,59653745,2016-01-13,31040794,Leon,"This is a great price for a room in Boston. I stayed 6 nights. Roxbury is a big city neighborhood, so be aware and don't expect trimmed lawns and gated communities. If you enjoy real cities, you'll be fine. The house is nice, and there's a major bus terminal just down the hill."
1850260,61540370,2016-02-05,55803742,Travis,"Sarah was nice, warm, and welcoming. Her home was beautiful and my room was clean, private, and quiet."
1850260,61963706,2016-02-09,12499511,Max,"Sarah was not there when I arrived but her sister let me in and showed me to the room. Its up 2 staircases that are quite narrow so it was a bit difficult getting up there while trying not to ruin the walls. The room was somewhat dark and cold, but I asked for an additional space heater and she gladly gave it to me. Other than that, I had almost zero interaction with anyone in the house. The bathroom was adequate and it was all mine since there was no one staying in the adjacent room. The place was very close to Boston Medical Center which is really all I cared about, but the neighborhood doesn't have a the best feel to it. I cannot comment on safety since I drove in on a very snowy day and the streets were essentially empty. The house was quiet and a bit cold, but other than that it was a good value for what I needed."
1850260,65109563,2016-03-10,5290002,Jason,"I was just there for a quick night's sleep while travelling. The bed was cozy, and I had the bathroom all to myself since no one was staying across the hall."
1850260,65903462,2016-03-17,905455,Alicia,"Sarah was very friendly and communicative. Her family members were also very welcoming. It was the first time I've stayed in a room in a shared house, and I was pretty nervous about having to share space with other people. I didn't find it awkward or weird at all. Quite the opposite."
1850260,66223695,2016-03-20,23308080,Sheri,"Clean, quiet, homey. Hostess was very helpful in answering questions and recommending me to take advantage of Boston's Metro Cab service since I was unfamiliar with local transportation."
1850260,66660947,2016-03-24,46021156,Ulf,"VI hade kontakt i god tid före min ankomst och jag ändrade från att komma ensam till att ta med en kompis, och sen tillbaka till ensamboende utan problem. Sarah var även hemma för att släppa in mig vis ankomst ca 22.30 trots att hon var på väg till sitt nattjobb. Allt som var annonserat fanns på plats. Lite långt från centrum men med buss (för en kostnad av 2.60 USD) kom man till South station eller downtown."
1850260,71288822,2016-04-24,3246735,Randy,Sarah was such a pleasure and helpful. Her house was very welcoming and clean! She was such a good spirit. The room was very cozy and relaxing and the bathroom was very clean. The area was very easy to navigate. Its was quick walk to the nearest bus station. I would love to stay there again the next time I visit Boston. Thanks Sarah!
1850260,73931581,2016-05-11,10834146,Archana,My stay was very pleasant. Host was kind and considerate. Lovely home she opened up to me with. Very trusting and I felt safe being in Boston my first time. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
1850260,74590160,2016-05-16,15050732,Roma,"Llegue antes de lo previsto, pero no fue problema. La familia de Sarah me dio la bienvenida. Su hijo fue un encanto, me ayudo a subir la maleta (enorme y pesada!). Hacia mucho calor en la habitación, pero con abrir un poco la ventana, enseguida se refrescó. La cama era cómoda, y hay un gran armario donde pude guardar la maleta. Compartí el baño con otros invitados pero nunca hubo problema. El barrio está bien, un poco lejos del centro andando, pero el bus 4 o 5, a unos 5min, te deja justo en el Downtown. Hay un supermercado a unos 10minutos andando. Para desayunar no había gran cosa en la casa, a pesar de que se indique que se da el desayuno, así que puede resultar práctico para comprarse algo."
1850260,74907479,2016-05-17,56763309,Sigurjón,"Sarah was a very friendly host and helpful. The room was tidy and the bed was comfortable. The shower is a bit tricky, please ask Sarah to explain how it works unless you choose an icecold shower!"
1850260,76004307,2016-05-24,67480432,Osvaldo Ivan,Thanks for all it was excelent and clean
1850260,80880984,2016-06-20,59883,Kuang,This house is located in a neighborhood that may not be safe to walk around at night. I arrived around 10 pm and felt a little bit uncomfortable walking from the bus station to the house (5 min walk) but nothing bad happened. Sarah seemed very nice over text messages but never met her as she was working night shifts. Her young son helped me checked in and out. He seemed grumpy so I didn't feel very welcomed the whole time. Those who are sensitive to heat should know that there's a fan and a standing AC that blows cold air from the front and hot air from the back so it really didn't cool down the room. And because the room sits on the loft it was very hot.
1850260,81665112,2016-06-24,58189042,Ayodele,"Sarah was really helpful and friendly getting me to the location, however I didn't really interact with Sarah that much. The area is very Urban and it had a lot of eats and even a drug store all with in walking distance. This was a great place to help me prep for the next day."
1850260,83146833,2016-07-01,34868756,Zwelakhe-Duma,"It's a joy to reside at Miss Sarah's lovely home once again. She's such a warm, loving, and welcoming person, it feels like I'm coming to my own family's home. My residence was great; huge, spacious, clean, and comfortable room, with plush carpeting to boot ! The neighborhood was also very comfortable and family orientated. If only we could give Miss Sarah more than 5 stars, thank you again !"
1850260,83835481,2016-07-04,33683611,Naomi,Sarah's young son was super helpful.  He offered to help with luggage which I found to be very thoughtful of him.  Minutes away from Boston downtown and street parking which was great!
1850260,87087920,2016-07-18,26387705,Jurij,I was really enjoyed my stay in Sarah's house. Nice clean room. close location to the downtown.
1850260,87317618,2016-07-19,53054329,Gerardo,"I didnt have the opportunity to meet Sarah, I met her son. The room was really clean and as described."
1850260,87496289,2016-07-20,78192089,Briana,Sarah and her son were wonderful hosts! They made sure I had everything I needed and was comfortable in their home. The room itself was very clean.
1850260,89434899,2016-07-28,85463254,Deborah,Ms. Sarah was very nice.  Her son nice too.  The house was beautiful and our room was spacious.
1850260,91239633,2016-08-04,80487913,Omar,"Great cozy place. Sarah is a very sweet lady who's super welcoming and really makes you feel at home. The room is on the top floor of the house, opposite another room that is rented out. Bedroom is nice, complete with a nice bed, table, and a/c. The location is walking distance away from a bus station. Would highly recommend this place!"
1850260,96804564,2016-08-24,14926681,Kitty,Sarah was very friendly and welcoming.
6167184,37584494,2015-07-08,6922201,Viney K,The apartment was exactly as described.
I could not have had a better location. Minutes away from a great park on Fenway,excellent for morning walks & jogs,.,,,
And also next to whole foods store & T Line.,,,,,
Hence,for a traveller,there could be no better location.,,,
Sean was extremely helpful and went out of the way to assist to clear a mess that I had created.,,,,,
While the apartment does not have WiFi,it is easily accessible from the XInfinity Access Point available in the building.,,,,
I would surely love to stay there again.,,,,,
"Thank you Sean.\"",,,,,
6167184,41872821,2015-08-09,2808803,Angela,"\"The location of Sean's apartment is quite perfect. It is within walking distance of Fenway Park and easy to get into Back Bay. I should have read the amenities more closely because there was no air conditioning or fans in the apartment. The amenities do claim to have \"\"essentials"
6167184,46769813,2015-09-13,3528227,Adam,Sean was very easy to communicate with before and during my trip. He arranged a way for me to receive my keys for the trip which was very helpful. The apartment was in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to the green and orange lines. It was a great location to visit Boston. Great stay here!
6167184,47772332,2015-09-21,40044450,Kirk,"Apartment was in a great location however the place itself was underwhelming to say the least. We were given a 10 minute window to arrive & upon entering, were given a key we were told was the only copy. 5 minutes after Sean left, he reentered the apartment without knocking, with a key. The shower curtain was covered in black mold and there was hair all around the tub & sink. To top things off, there were no fans or air conditioning in the unit and it was 85 degrees outside. We would not stay here again nor recommend it."
6167184,49465728,2015-10-04,42522501,Glenn,"\"Sean's place is in a nice neighborhood and it has everything you need as a \"\"home base\"\" while visiting Boston. I'd highly recommend it to anyone visiting campuses in the area or attending conferences. \""
6167184,53379167,2015-11-08,47021562,Ted,"Clean place, great location, easy access.  Sean even left treats at our arrival.  Very happy."
6167184,55241750,2015-11-29,4924887,Tyler,Great place for a weekend trip to Boston.  Location is perfect.  The apartment was clean and tidy on arrival.  We didn't get to meet Sean but he was more than helpful and welcoming in our correspondence.  I would recommend this apartment.
6167184,64598946,2016-03-06,5264203,Adam,"A great little spot for checking out Boston. Close to Fenway and a short cab ride to TD Center (which is why I was in town). The one bedroom has all the amenities for a short term or long term stay. Sean was very communicative and explicit with instructions so check in was easy. I did notice the lack of a TV, which wasn't a big deal considering I spent little time inside!"
6167184,68311445,2016-04-04,23612085,Evelyn,The listing description was accurate and the neighbourhood was lovely. It was a nice place.
6167184,73333093,2016-05-08,18096910,Nick,"This apartment was exactly as advertised - clean, convenient to Back Bay/Fenway and public transportation, and looked like the photos. Emailing with Sean was easy and he was quite responsive to all of my questions. I would definitely stay here again."
6167184,78201011,2016-06-05,18188366,Daniel,"I was very excited for my trip to Boston and was thrilled at the location since I needed to spend some time at BU on top of my sightseeing plans. The area is very cute, mostly residential but walking distance to a nice park, bars and restaurants as well as a couple of markets. I had no problem finding the location and Sean mailed me the keys with entrance instructions in advance which was very convenient."
The apartment was a perfect size for me and would probably work well for a couple also. I was slightly surprised to arrive to the apartment and while it was “tidy” it was not actually clean,specifically in the bathroom. The sink and soap dispenser were matted with left over shavings and toilet had obviously not been cleaned in some time,upon opening the shower curtain there similarly was hair there too. I reached out to Sean about the mess and he assured me that I would not be charged a cleaning fee. While it was kind of him to address the issue in a timely manner,I would’ve preferred to pay the fee then to stay in a dirty place.,,
I was further surprised when after my arrival I received an email from Sean with a list of requests. He asked that I not tell his neighbors that I’m using his place or tell them his unit was an Airbnb. He also requested that I keep all noise to a minimum and cause no attention to be drawn to myself. I quickly got the hint that he’s renting his apartment either illegally or without permission. Not that I had any intention of hosting  a large,loud party or to introduce myself to the building… but I likely would not have selected his space if I had known that it was under the pretenses. Finally,he requested that should any packages arrive for him in the mail area that I bring them upstairs for him… his apartment was a third flood walk up. I’m not sure if he’s ever rented his unit prior to this weekend but requesting someone who’s paying you to carry your deliveries up 3 flights of stairs is not only bad etiquette it’s just slightly rude.,,,
In the future I will be more diligent at asking questions in advance of renting a space and will definitely be looking at a different unit than this one when visiting Boston.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6167184,83223349,2016-07-01,33905555,William,"We had a great stay at Sean's place. He was accurate in describing the unit and swift in responding to questions. The place was very tidy and there is lots to do in the neighborhood and it is very convenient to Berklee College of Music, Northeastern Univ, Boston Symphony, Fine Arts Museum, public gardens, restaurants etc...and with very easy access to the T.   There is some street noise at night and construction going on close by which starts early in the AM, so not ideal if you are a light sleeper or like to sleep in.  This is a greater challenge on warm nights because the apartment is not air conditioned which necessitates sleeping with the windows open."
6167184,84030393,2016-07-05,36850095,Pawel,"Awesome location, perfect place to spend a weekend."
6167184,86835217,2016-07-17,44432819,Geoffrey,"I want to start this review by saying that Boston is a great city to visit and for the most part is clean, attractive, and has plenty of activities to offer."
With respect to this apartment I would not recommend it for anything other than its close location to Fenway park. Upon arriving I noticed that the apartment was very hot and stagnant and there was no air conditioning or fan to move any air around which made for a very uncomfortable sleeping arrangement. Adding to this the bathroom was quite messy with lots of little hairs around both the sink and toilet seat. The bed sheets were not clean and had a very musty smell to them.,,,,,
I found all this very ridiculous considering the price that I paid to stay at this place. After contacting the owner about my complaints and requesting a discount on the place he offered to give me a 25% discount on my next stay for which there will be no next stay.,,,,,
Thus I would not recommend this place for anyone,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6167184,91849034,2016-08-06,56523680,Jeff,The apartment was as promised and the location is perfect for a trip to Fenway. Sean was a great host and was always available when needed.

Sean was a superb host too. His instructions were extremely clear, and he responded ASAP to our questions. The street can be a little noisy in the morning, but it's not bad if you close the windows. I would highly recommend a stay."
6167184,96165051,2016-08-22,52170238,Patrick,"We could not have had a better time or been more impressed. Sean mailed us our keys and they arrived exactly as promised. The apartment was just like it was advertised and every room was clean and tidy. Sean clearly took the time to clean the apartment, and he left us plenty of towels and a fan so we didn't get too hot at night. We were very satisfied with our stay and would definitely go there again."
12667158,81222823,2016-06-21,21804777,Cecilia,It was a great workout staying at Lisa. Only getting the stroller in and out of the building was a mission itself not to mention climbing the hill with two kids and taking care of the laundry at ground floor (which cost extra).
The apartment itself was basic with stiff beds and not so many furniture. If you have any plans preparing any meals I recommend you to check other alternatives or bring your own gear eg. Coffee maker,wine opener,can opener,spatula,ovenproof dish,a pair of scissors and measuring cups. Are you a party of four we recommend you to bring at least one glass since it is only three in the apartment.
Since we travel with young children (5 year old and 9 months) we were planning to cook a lot of food ourself which wouldn't be doable without a lot of imagination and a Swiss Army knife. A microwave had of course made our stay a bit more convenient when heating the bottles,especially nighttime.,,,,
The good things were that the apartment had a nice view from the balcony,it had a parkingh lot and the playground just a cross the street was highly appreciated!  The service people in the building Office are truly the best!,,,,
Finally if we would come back to Boston ( which we probably will do) bagain we would put in an extra 10 dollar to get another place,since we didn't come along we the host.,,,,

The neighborhood is very nice and we felt very comfortable walking around. Great access to the T line,groceries and restaurants - all within an easy walk.,,,,
Only two downsides to note: no central A/C (the nights cool off well,but you may want to consider the weather in the summer) and off street parking requires going down a very narrow driveway to the back of the house (was possible but scary in our minivan).,,,,

The house was perfect for our needs (6 scientists): it is great for 6 individuals or several couples. For those who are used to cycle: there are boston hubway bikes on the corner of the street. They enabled us to visit the entire city without having to suffer in the public transport or spend a lot on taxis: it is about 25 minutes to the center of Boston, to MIT, Harvard, the beach,..."

Right in the heart of everything. We were able to walk to our company, food, and shopping. The key exchange was easy and professional. I would definitely recommend this property! Thank you!"

The apartment is not easily to find when we first got there, but it is really the heart of downtown. The host is really kind. We arrived as late as almost 12am. He waited for us and delivered the key. Great experience:)"
6181758,34925480,2015-06-13,29977989,Дмитрий,"An overall very pleasant experience! Superb location, fully equipped apartment, easy checkin and check out. Lots of pleasant emotions. Highly recommend."

They had snacks, bottled water, and toiletries available for us when we got there. We'd love to stay here again!"

6181758,39393567,2015-07-23,19361446,Samie,Great place in a great location! Communication was quick and seamless. The kitchen was perfect for a few quick meals. Everything was clean and well maintained. Could not have asked for better!
6181758,39626843,2015-07-25,8852951,Casey,"Dave is very nice and easy to communicate with. His apartment was clean, and his key service was very accommodating; however, we found the apartment expensive for its rather small size. There is only one window in the apartment, and there is little seating. The neighborhood is very noisy as well, and we had some trouble sleeping. I regret to say I would not stay there again."
6181758,40145874,2015-07-28,16006671,Martin Fox,"This is an amazing location in Boston, right downtown, across the street from the downtown crossing subway station, steps from the freedom trail, and surrounded by great shops. The apartment was well equipped for our family of four. Cooking was easy and the bedrooms were comfortable."
We didn't have any contact with Dave during our stay (only because the visit was so smooth that we didn't need anything from him). Mike,who brought us the key,"was very helpful getting us settled -even found us a place to park our rental car while we moved in! \"",,,
6181758,40513197,2015-07-31,810947,Matt,"Great location! The setup is a little weirder than the pictures imply, with no real sitting area other than a bedroom, but the place was still great."
We ran into a few other issues around the place that didn't seem like anyone's fault,"but the host was very quick to respond on everything. \"",,,,

6181758,41165617,2015-08-04,11920053,Priya,Dave's apartment was wonderful--great location and the inside of the apartment was great too. We had a comfortable stay--the umbrella came in real handy with the rainy morning we had during our stay. Booking and checking in process was super smooth. Looking forward to being back soon!
6181758,41458085,2015-08-07,2674113,Mike,This place is great!!  Plenty for space and location is perfect.  1 block to Boston Common and Uber or Lyft or readily available for a $7 ride anywhere you need to go.  Will use for all my trips to Boston!!
6181758,41813901,2015-08-09,37221093,Stephanie,"Great location! I stayed at the heart of Downtown for a weekend getaway with friends. With it being in Downtown Crossing it is accessible to any type of shopping or tourist attractions you may want. It is also very close to the MBTA if where you want to go is not accessible by foot. Dave's apartment is great! It had everything we could have wanted, we actually decided to make breakfast one morning and it had all of the cooking utensils we needed and was across the street from a Rouch Bros. He left us towels, clean linens and any sort of cleaning supplies we may have needed for the weekend. It was perfect for our getaway because we didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment. It doesn't have a living room so if you are looking to spend a lot of time entertaining in the apartment this may not be your spot. We had an issue with the cable and we received an answer and a solution immediately. Getting the keys for the apartment happened exactly when it was supposed to and we also were shown the apartments amenities upon arrival. This place is such a deal because you are in the heart of Boston! I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking to stay in Boston within walking distance of anything you might want!"
6181758,42223573,2015-08-11,40632919,Cesar,great location and place. Would definitely stay here again in the future.
6181758,42494275,2015-08-13,31317390,Shelley,"Thank you for a great 2 day business trip in Boston. The apartment was awesome, and in a fantastic location! Everything was very clean and inviting. The bottle of wine was a nice touch also as Red Zin is one of my favorites! The only complaint I have to mention is the road that the apartment is on is a pedestrian ONLY street from 11a-6p, and my cab dropped me off about 2 blocks from the bldg. Was a little challenging considering it was raining, and I had to carry my luggage also...but was DEFINITELY worth it! I highly recommend this place, and will be back!"

6181758,43780151,2015-08-22,22429346,Ciara,"The location and quality of this apartment is superb and fits the description as outlined in all other reviews. We were a family of 4 visiting Boston for 2 nights. Unfortunately, the 2 who were sleeping in the front room did not get much sleep as there is major construction work underway across the street and this street is noisy at night! The 2 who slept in the other room were fine! This is not the fault of the owner but we are leaving Boston pretty exhausted! I would recommend the apartment and early and late arrivals and departures were kindly facilitated!"
6181758,44367375,2015-08-25,41495200,Nancee,"This was our first Airbnb stay and it could not have been better. The apartment is well located, a short walk from South Station, minutes from Boston Commons with all kinds of shopping right outside the door! The two bedroom apartment perfectly suited our needs and while we ate all of our meals out, everything you need for cooking is right there. We didn't do everything we wanted to do while in Boston, we plan on coming back to Dave's place on a future trip. Thanks for everything!"

6181758,46978578,2015-09-14,43281245,Jackie,"Very nice apartment and a great location! Shops and restaurants RIGHT outside.  It was nice to have tea and soaps provided.  The one thing I didn't realize when I booked is there is literally no sitting area (other than a dining room table) outside the rooms.  It was not a problem at all for us since we literally only used the apartment to sleep and shower, but just something to note if you are travelling with 4 people like we were!"

The apartment was exactly as advertised in the listing, clean, comfortable, and in a great, central location. We also appreciated the flexibility to drop off our bags prior to check-in time, since our train arrived in the morning. The apartment is fully stocked with anything you might need during your stay. Dave was very communicative and made sure that we had everything we needed prior to our arrival."
6181758,48403785,2015-09-26,34296468,Carlos,"Tuvimos una experiencia general muy buena.  Llegamos a Boston una hora antes de lo previsto, y enseguida se acercaron a entregarnos las llaves. El departamento esta muy bien equipado y cumple con lo que promete. Sabíamos de antemano que una de las habitaciones era algo ruidosa, especialmente por una obra en construcción que hay en frente, pero esto no fue un gran problema. Si bien no conocimos a Dave, se ve que esta todo muy bien preparado para recibir a la gente. Muy buena ubicación del departamento. Gracias."

6181758,50290248,2015-10-11,22977347,Marianne,"We loved the place!  It was meticulously clean and nicely stocked with necessities as well as extras such as coffee, tea, and chocolate.  We were a couple and a single person, so this 2BR unit was ideal for us.  It was conveniently located to everything we wanted to see and do. It was an easy walk to the harbor, Faneuil Hall, Freedom Trail, Boston Commons, North End, etc. There were many restaurants nearby, both high end and casual. Both Dave and Mike responded promptly to our communications. Mike met us with the key right on time, and he was able to let us check in a little early. Also, at our request, Mike recommended Nico Restaurant, which we loved ... ended up going there twice. We were all very happy with this condo. We would definitely stay here again."
6181758,50751577,2015-10-14,40808624,Douglas,The condo and experience were exactly as described.  Friendly staff met us very late in the evening to let us in and provide the keys.  21:30 on a Sunday night is great service.
The space was clean and well kept,in a nice central location to everything needed in the Boston area.  Good shops,bars,food,and transit within steps of the condo.,

6181758,51704231,2015-10-24,38973155,Sandra,Great place. Close to the T and shopping. Only a 15min walk to the aquarium. Only big issue was the noise in the front room at night. Construction across the street made it difficult to sleep some nights. But overall great place to stay and definitely recommend!
6181758,52494626,2015-10-30,44150663,Michal,"The place is clean and nice. Very well located! Only couple steps from two T (subway) stations. There is everything you need in the apartment including towels and shower gel. Kitchen is fully functional (plates, pots, cutlery etc.). Because of the location it is a bit loud place (noise from the street and nearby construction yard)."
"Almost perfect for few days in Boston!\"",,,,,
6181758,52686767,2015-11-01,42246943,Louis,"Our flight was very late in arriving at Logan. The host and his representatives were most welcoming and accommodating. Our unit was ready and waiting with all necessary personal amenities: towels, shampoo, soap. The kitchen was supplied will all the necessary electrical appliances and certain convenient pantry items. The unit was exactly as advertised. It was perfectly clean, comfortable and conveniently situated in the heart of the city. Food, tourist attractions, stores and parks were all within close walking distance."

6181758,53466184,2015-11-09,42956512,Cara,"\"What a fantastic location for this cozy apartment.  Convenient to transit, right around the corner from the start of the Freedom Trail, and in the center of a vibrant retail scene.  The apartment was clean and comfortable--beds were great.  As other reviews have noted, there is a large construction project going on right across the street, so if you like to sleep in, that may bother you.  (The project appears to be nearing completion...) The only other thing to reiterate from other reviews is that there is no \"\"sitting room\"\" area in this apartment.  Although you can pull out the table in the kitchen/hallway and seat 4 people"

I booked very last minute and Dave was able to accomodate us without a hitch. 2 good size bedrooms, clean and everything we needed was close by. The location truly makes this place special! Really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this listing to anybody. It is noisy at night though due to the construction site right opposite, but that's only with the bedroom closest to the street."

The apartment was in a great location for my business meetings, and it was very clean and perfectly comfortable for me. I get tired of having to eat out when I'm traveling for business, so the grocery store across the street made it feasible to cook a dinner with the modest, but adequate, kitchen equipment available in the apartment.  This was an excellent airbnb experience and I highly recommend Dave's apartment."

Perfect for this time of year as Macy's is right around the corner.  We were met right on time for key exchange by representative and Dave was always available to answer our questions.  The accomodations are as described. Bed was super comfortable and place was clean. Subway entrance is just downstairs and major attractions are walking distance (esp. the North End for great Italian food!)  We highly recommend Dave's place in the heart of Downtown!

This was my first Airbnb experience and I was very pleased with the service provided. Key hand over was easy (e-mails to arrange a time & one phone call on the arrival day to check we were running on time). It is a nice touch to have the kitchen well equipped (including coffee, tea, salt, pepper, bottled water, chocolate, dishwasher soap, paper kitchen towels...) and to have some shampoo & soaps provided.

As described the TV is in the second bedroom, which with 4 of us in the flat felt a little cramped.  Great location in the middle of the main shopping area and with everything in easy reach.  Most of the communication was with the key service, but they were always helpful especially on the last day when they had a space we could store our luggage until our flight in the evening.  10am checkout did seem very early."

6181758,70669329,2016-04-19,42811102,Andrew,"This apartment could not be better placed to give you access to everything Boston has to offer. 50 yards from Downtown Crossing, 100 yards from Park Street MBTA stations. 50 yards from Roche Bros supermarket with just the best selection of fresh food you can imagine. I will whisper the next bit. If you are coming over marathon weekend you are 100 yards from the bus stops on Boston common and half s mile from the bottom of Boylston street. Please don't book over this weekend as I may want to come back. We self catered and were able to do everything we wanted. We visited with an elderly relative and wheelchair access was fine. Only planning point is that taxis cannot pull into Washington street before 6 pm due to pedestrian only rules and parking is difficult in the area. Closest taxi can get is about 100 yards away outside Park St Station. Not a place to have a hire car  but why would you in downtown Boston. We would definitely stay again if we came back to Boston"
6181758,71434803,2016-04-25,49444845,Beth,"This apartment is a great place if you need somewhere to stay in the area! David was very quick with all responses to my questions, and the key management service was very prompt. I got a quick call about 15 minutes ahead of time (perfect since we had just gotten off the train) to verify we would be there on time, and where we would meet for the exchange. The apartment is small but it has everything we needed. The entire place was clean with fresh towels and other essentials when we arrived. Everything you need is likely in the apartment and is easy to find, and it was the perfect place to rest our heads after long days at a convention (that is what we stayed for). I highly recommend David's apartment. We didn't do much shopping, but there is a lot to choose from in the area - even an awesome local grocery store across the street. It is also very close to several transit stops and the train station."

6181758,89215341,2016-07-27,6257969,Amrish,Had a great stay in this apartment. Dave was super fast at responding to questions. He and his team were so efficient in getting us into the apartment.
Myself and a colleague were in Boston for the day on business. This was the perfect choice and location for us. In the heart of the city - we were walking distance from all our clients and prospects.,,,,,
Thanks so much for a great stay. Highly recommend renting this place if you need a place to stay in Boston.,,,,,

Great shops and food stores in the area, all is near and in walking distance including South Station and the Park Plaza Motormart, if you want to rent a car. Dave replied super fast, everything was simple and easy. The room to the street is loudish, lightsleeper better use the first bedroom or take earplugs."

6181758,92664238,2016-08-09,15646416,Jason,"Everything was 100% as advertised. Quick response on the request, great communication throughout the process, and the pictures are exactly what you can expect when you walk in. A great location downtown that puts you just a short walk to so much as well as several T stops for others. Not a fault of the property, but others were accurate as to the noise from the bedroom near the street... it's a major city. For light sleepers bring ear plugs or settle into the cozy little cave of a bedroom away from the street for a quiet night."

6181758,97816494,2016-08-28,45320843,Zach,"Dave's place was great. Downtown Crossing isn't the coolest neighborhood in Boston, but it's a great jumping off point for the rest of the City. Plus, the Arch Street parking garage was a stone's throw away and was super reasonable for a weekend night."

7741566,42635841,2015-08-14,20776324,Elisa And Ricardo,"Just a perfect new house in a very nice and safe neighborhood super convenient to the grocery store, restaurants, shopping, bars, and Harvard Square.  Todd is such a great host, he's super friendly, helpful, and his place is immaculately clean!  It was easy to get around too, the bus stop is right at the end of the street.  I would definitively recommend his house again."
7741566,49327545,2015-10-03,3148445,Mariana,"\"Todd and his staff were absolutely amazing, they made my stay very comfortable and welcome in every way. The house it is exactly as advertised (super equipped, very clean and well organized). Everything was new and I could used the kitchen every time I wanted as well as the living room and all areas of the house. \"\"Sunny room\"\" where I stayed for a month is a really big room with a comfy queen bed and a huge walking closet. There are plenty of bathrooms including all the amenities."
Every guest I met was very respectful and nice. Todd organized a Mexican dinner where we could chat and met people who was staying at the house and it was awesome!,,,,,
Localization is great! There's a bus stop (86) just 4 minutes walk which takes you to Harvard square where is the red line to Boston downtown. There are also supermarkets and restaurants also near the house.,,,,,
Todd was super flexible with our late check out and he was aware of every detail to make me feel at home. I highly recommend this place,and for sure will be in my top list,thanks for all!! Todd if you go to Brazil let us know,you are more than welcome to stay in our place!,,

7741566,52107588,2015-10-26,44199998,Laurence,Location is as described. Todd was not here but he gave accurate details to get inside
7741566,61298182,2016-02-02,52160872,Úrsula,"I felt completely at home at Todd's house, and every little problem I had was promptly solved. He even hosted a great dinner for us the Airbnb guests. He is a really cool host."
The house is amazing,well decorated,really confortable and has everything you might need,with a supermarket really close and well connected to the city.,,

The room was cozy and well decorated with a spacious walk in closet and the house overall was very comfortable to stay at . The room and the house were perfectly depicted by  todd on his profile. The room was very sunny though, which made it absolutely impossible to stay asleep after 7 am .to sum up the experience at todd's house was dazzling , i would definitely go for this appartment again if i were back in boston anytime soon."
7741566,66746257,2016-03-24,37612296,Diego,Todd took care of setting us up and he was very responsive.
Most of the housemates were very nice and clean,but as is expected when sharing there was one who wasn't that much.,,,,
Todd was responsive for that as well,and his intervention was positive.,,,,
"The house was close to public transport to get to the touristic spots.  I recommend using (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps + buses to move around because just walking is not as close.  You can still get the walking once you're in the touristic places. \"",,,,,
7741566,69120111,2016-04-09,5207146,Grant,"Room was super clean. Giant walk-in closet, comfortable bed.  Everything was as described in the listing. I'll definitely be looking up Todd's properties in the future!"

7741566,73481248,2016-05-08,46178182,Lisa,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Todd's place for our weekend trip to Boston.  We had a fabulous experience and would highly recommend this place. The bedroom was impeccably clean and quite cozy. The private bathroom was within close quarters and was also fabulous. Toiletries were provided, which was very convenient. The house, on a whole, was really beautifully decorated and kept immaculate. We had a few neighbors but everyone was very respectful of the other guests. There was also free parking along the street, which was most convenient since we rented a van for our trip. Todd uses a self-check-in system, which required the use of a security code to gain access to the home. This was very convenient for us since our flight didn't arrive till late at night. Todd was a great host. He provided all the necessary information needed to make things run smoothly. Overall, we had a remarkable stay! We couldn't have asked for anything better!"
7741566,74962313,2016-05-17,61144964,Helge,"This was our first time on Airbnb and it really was a great experiece from start to end. Todd was excellent on timely information and very flexible during the whole process. We were upgraded with own bathroom without any extra cost and got a later checkout without a problem. The rooms and common areas  fully met our expectations and the other guests were very nice, helpfull and respectfull. This was not a typical Airbnb with a host living on the premises but more like a hostel. That concept worked out perfectly for us. We will definately use Airbnb in the future."

The place isn't great if you want to spend time in central Boston,you'd have to walk to Harvard sq. (a lovely walk) and hop on the red line. It doesn't matter though,the house is worth it.,,,
We got to meet Todd,and he's a great guy,warm,and very welcoming.,,
I could go on and on,but you should find out for yourself. 10/10,"would do again. \"",,,

11588543,65929870,2016-03-18,63057032,Bryan,"We rented the sunny brownstone to host family in from out of town.  Sean was great - flexible and timely when meeting to show us the space, and very helpful with local info.  Several South End favorites like Toro, Blunch, and Flour are within blocks.  The unit was gorgeous with great light, large master, beautiful marble fireplaces, and refinished original wood floors.  Lots of space for the neighborhood.  The finishing touches were beyond our expectations and much appreciated.  A thoughtful neighborhood guide, toiletries, and coffee were all provided.  The family we had stay there was very impressed."

11588543,71984674,2016-04-30,50774545,Michael,Absolutely beautiful apartment which met our needs for a short stay in Boston to help our daughter move.  The pictures give an accurate depiction of the place.  Only 2 minor complaints:
1.  The bed is extremely firm and,while OK for me,was uncomfortable for my wife.,,,
2.  Sean lowered his daily rate several days before our arrival but wouldn't give me the new rate.  Not unreasonable since we had agreed on the higher price but he could have offered  to split the difference.,,,,,
We would highly recommend this apartment.,,,,,

11588543,72646224,2016-05-04,45893,Erin,"I have stayed in Airbnb many times Sean's apartment is the best I have ever seen.  I highly recommend it.  The apartment is quite spacious, tastefully decorated, and very comfortable.  Also very clean!  Sean is a great communicator and his instructions made it easy to enter the apartment and to use the wi-fi and other amenities inside.  The best thing about the apartment that I didn't anticipate was the location!  I thought the neighborhood might be lacking in charm, but on the contrary, it's really great.  Well-kept brownstones, neighborhood parks, and local restaurants defined the area.  (At least if you walk from the apartment toward Boston Common/Beacon Hill area - we didn't explore the other direction - might be nice too but I can't say).  We walked all the way to Beacon Hill several times.  Nothing but good things to say about the apartment and our experience there."

11588543,74526200,2016-05-15,66649639,Justin,"\"The apartment was excellent overall. It has a fantastic layout, with a seperate office space away from the bedroom, walk through spacious kitchen and living room, excellent sized bathroom and bedroom. Everything was very clean, immaculate actually. There are ceiling fans in both the living room and the bedroom, I am glad they were there. They only seemed to have one speed, high...but I may be wrong, would have been nice to have lower speed. Also, being from the south I am used to AC at night, this was absent...but not really needed after a slight adjustment...pretty common up North, so nothing unusual. The location was nice, decently close to the \"\"T\"\" (subway transit) and bus routes. Had a good amount of dining in the area (he has a suggestion book for you) and grocery store right down the block. My wife and i felt safe the entire time"

11588543,81368409,2016-06-22,76209186,Dev,"The place was wonderful and Sean was very responsive with questions. The only negative was some confusion about damages. My guest and I had checked the entire apartment and cleaned up after ourselves before we left, as asked by the host, but afterwards was sent a request for payment of a large sum for damage of a chair with pictures included. A large spill of what looked like coffee that wasn't attempted to be cleaned up was on the chair, and once cleaned had left some staining. It was a pretty big spill and something my guest and I would have noticed while cleaning up before we left, but we had no recollection what-so-ever of any major spills happening. We let the host know that we do not think we are responsible for the damages and are currently waiting to hear back from Airbnb about the verdict. If my guest and I had created the spill we would have attempted to clean it up and notified the host and would have no problem with paying for the damages. Other than the damage confusion, it was a pleasant stay."

5058148,28089414,2015-03-17,28068336,Jessica,"The location was perfect with a fabulous diner around the corner named Mike's. We were able to get a feel for the real Boston. Mike , Ibrahim's caretaker, was very helpful and welcoming. The flowers on the table were a nice touch. Only note: the bed was VERY VERY firm."
5058148,28900976,2015-03-31,29294608,Steve,"Ibrahim's apartment was the perfect stay for me. I'm finishing up my thesis and needed to do a lot of writing with no distractions while attending a conference at the convention center. I was looking for a place where I could be a hermit without feeling any obligations to interact with anyone, and just get my work done - and that's exactly what I got!"
I arrived by bus on a Saturday evening,hopped on the Silver line (which stops just a block away),picked up my keys from a neighbor,and dropped off my bag before heading to a fantastic Senegalese place for dinner just a few blocks away.,,
The next day I wrote in peaceful solitude in the sunny living/dining room space before a refreshing ~40 minute afternoon walk to the convention center. The following day I packed up and left the keys on the counter per the instructions of Ibrahim's friend,Michael,who was always available by phone for questions while Ibrahim was out of town.,,,
The apartment is located in a wonderful part of the neighborhood,near restaurants,stores,and transportation.  I especially loved the African and Diaspora art throughout the house. The kitchen is very modern although I didn't get a chance to use it; everything was clean and essentials laid out. All in all,"I really couldn't ask for a better stay and I hope to return with less work to do!\"",
5058148,30380439,2015-04-21,26864359,Danni,Ibrahim was not there but his friend mike met up with me to provide  the keys. He was very friendly and suggested spots to go to as we were new to Boston.  Our stay was unbelievably pleasant because the neighborhood was lovely and quiet and walking distance from everywhere I needed to go.  I would definitely stay here again if I needed to.

Staying with her was the best the decision I made while getting settled into a new city. She is kind, genuine and a great host. Your safety and comfort is a top priority for her.

She even spent a whole Saturday driving me around. The apt is a beautiful house furnished with everything you may need. I was very happy with my choice but even more with Puhan.

9626892,97245755,2016-08-26,89851173,Cheng,Puhan's place is extremely nice!
The lovely private room in third floor is clean and spacious,with a walk-in closet and a large bathroom inside. The location is nice and quite,while also close to both Metro stations of green E line and orange line (Roxbury crossing),both with a around 10 minutes walk. Room with air-condition is enjoyable during summer. Kitchen is free to use,"and breakfast in balcony in summer morning is good experience! Puhan is a very good host. We would definitely like to recommend her place in Boston. \"",

It was very clean and tidy, and there were soft fluffy blankets folded for you to snuggle up with on the couch or bed. Very safe neighborhood, mostly inhabited with students at Boston College, though there are also some families."

A somewhat creaky but (for us) reliable elevator takes you to the fifth floor 1-bdr apt with comfortable queen bed and nice couch in the living room for a guest. For added comfort: AC on a warm September weekend, plus nice shower/tub with abundant hot water."
We were there only to sleep and shower but also appreciated the fast WiFi. In a commercial area with nearby restaurants and coffee shops and drugstore,etc but not much noise from the street and none from inside the apartment building. Small well equipped kitchen. Although we did not meet Alex,"she was extremely responsive to texts and phone calls. Also we changed the reservation dates a couple of time - she was very flexible and accommodating. I recommend this apt to anyone seeking a reasonably priced comfortable option in the Chestnut Hill/Boston College neighborhood.\"",,,

Right of three different T stops, plus a bus to Harvard Square. No need for a car, although we had one. The metered street parking is free after 6pm, but you have to move it by 8am, Monday thru Saturday with Sundays free. It's also safe to park on Sutherland Rd. There is street parking on the right side/East side, no need to pay. (The left side/West side is \"\"resident only\"\" so beware"

The apt definitely looks bigger in photos.  The apt was not cleaned in a way where it was ready to receive guests. The location made up for that fact. The description verbiage doesn't exactly match; it is described as \"\"airy\"\" and that it is (URL HIDDEN) least not in the summer time as it is quite hot.

7086825,41233546,2015-08-05,14820025,Spencer,"This is a wonderful place to stay via AirBnB. Barrie and his wife are superb hosts. The house is set up so that guests have plenty of privacy and can still intermingle with other guests should they choose. I shared the house with the host, and one other guest (a family) and had a great experience. My room was quiet, and the bathroom was impeccably clean and tidy. Plus, the lines of communication are very open. Barrie even stayed up to greet me at the door as I arrived late from the airport."

7086825,57286119,2015-12-24,17766655,Steven,"Barrie and his family were delightful hosts. I had a long stay -- about five and a half weeks -- and while I was a bit nervous about sharing a home with people I did not know for that long, I was pleasantly surprised by their hospitality. I have just recently moved to Boston from Minnesota with the start of a new job and knew very little about living in Boston, but Barrie's family made me feel very welcome in their home, which helped minimize other stresses of moving across the country. They even invited me to join them for Thanksgiving dinner, which I really appreciated since I was so far away from home, family, and friends."
I am generally a very private person,and I felt that my privacy was respected. I had a room in the basement level of their home,neighboring two other short-term Airbnb guests,and could enter and leave the home freely through a back door. I shared a bathroom in the lowest level with the two other guests,but there were other bathrooms available in the home if needed. I am an avid cook,and while cooking utensils and pans were limited
Their home is a 5-minute walk to a bus stop that will take you directly to Forest Hills station in less than 10 minutes. There is also a grocery store,Walgreens,and dollar store that is a 15-minute walk away. It is also close to Roslindale Village,where you'll find cute boutiques and Fornax Bread Company (a popular bakery). I'm a runner,and it's also easy access to the Harvard Arnold Aboretum as well as Jamaica Pond.,

At first, I was a little thrown off by the number of guest rooms Barrie had because I wasn't expecting it. The size of the bathroom is a bit tight but I had absolutely no problems using it or sharing it with other guests. The house and rooms were clean. I also was able to park my car behind their apartment."

Das Bad ist im Anschluss an das Zimmer und nur für uns gewesen. Die ganze Wohnung ist toll, modern und hochwertig eingerichtet. Darren erstellt einen Code für die Wohnungstür, so dass man jederzeit ungehinderten Zutritt zur Wohnung erhält. Perfekt! Zur Ubahn sind es 10 Minuten zu Fuß und die Fahrtzeit beträgt CA. 10 - 15 Minuten, wenn man nicht wie wir das Pech hat, das die Ubahn renoviert wird und dann Shuttlebusse eingesetzt werden. Das verzögert die Fahrt erheblich. Das kommt aber nur selten vor. Der Aufenthalt bei Darren kann uneingeschränkt empfohlen werden."

He even had a Charlie card for us to use - so we didn't have to buy our own to travel via the T. His home is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest T station making it a very convenient location - and he even had private parking for my car.

Bed is comfortable and clean. Without forgetting to mention that his house has a convenient location just a few blocks away from the  T-subway.

The deck outside was very nice to sit at with the warm weather we had during our stay. There are nice places to eat at in the neighborhood and one of the biggest subway lines is only a 10min. walk away. Darren was a very good host. He was really nice to talk to and even picked us up and dropped us off at the subway station when we had our luggage with us. He also gave us some good advice where to eat and what to visit.

8566407,91015949,2016-08-03,81721300,Monica,One of our considerations for a
"Boston stay was parking which was so easy with Darren.  Upon our arrival we were met in the parking lot and made to feel comfortable and at home immediately. Darren 's home is immaculate and the use of his deck with a door to the suite made it private and luxurious. Darren was very approachable with any questions as well as informative. A quick walk to the train made access to all the sights easy and hassle free from parking issues. \"",,,,,

Being close enough to the city, but also offering the updated space and off street parking was incredibly valuable. I was only here for 2 nights, but I was always pleased coming back to a nice place with an awesome patio. Darren is also a pleasure to interact with. Not only can he give you info about the city, but also many other locations as he's an avid traveler. Would recommend this place to anyone. Enjoyed my time!!!"

You could spend time there. Only a few metro stops away from the centre and  safe off street parking. Darren even gave us free travel cards for public transportation which was a great bonus. Darren was a overall great host. He welcomed us even though he hadn't hosted a couple with a child before.

You guys might be surprised about the name of the room (that is, office room), but in fact, this is because Robert rent me his office (in which he put a single bed) as the other rooms for rent were full. The bathroom was shared, but there has been no inconvenience."
I had a good time there. He kindly took some time to give me directions to reach his place as well as another place I had to head to. I recommend this place because 1) its location is perfect. 2) the owner is very kind 3) the house is victorian style.,,,,,

The house is in a nice neighbourhood,close to a station,Back Bay neighbourhood and the fancy Newbury Street. The staircase and the office room upstairs cramped with books and memorabilia and a little untidy. If you don't mind those discomforts,it's an affordable choice in comparison with the Boston price level.,,

There is a sweet cat that roams around,"which is no problem at all. But something to aware of if you're allergic.\"",,,,
225224,1106241,2012-04-10,2041878,Stephen,"I had a great time staying with Robert in his office room.  This is located in a very historical area and building -- Robert was kind enough to fill me in on that, as well as give directions and advice on the area.  The house is located in a safe area of town, just a block or two from the Back Bay subway station.  Also not much more than a 10-minute walk to the Hynes Convention Center (the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center is walkable too but far easier by subway + bus)."
Do note that Robert has proper rooms -- however,this particular room is indeed in an office room.  If you book into this room and expect a nice bed & breakfast type room atmosphere,you won't find it.  But if you're a solo traveler that just needs a cheap (and safe) bed to stay in,"then this is perfect.\"",,

225224,1230936,2012-05-05,2140601,Akos,The house is beautiful from the street. Inside?
It could be a charming old house. However,it is so dirty one can not imagine and smells hardly bearable. The staircase is dark at night (some sections have no lights you can put on),God save you from a bad step there. The lack of hygiene is so way out of any reasonable standard you feel to be really cheated when facing such an experience. One is wondering,how can something like this be offered for rent in old Boston without any control e.g. by the company that actually sells it,"also for commission?\"",

225224,1500815,2012-06-17,2572981,Bryce,Robert was incredibly nice and had great suggestions about things to see in the area. The location is perfect and incredibly close to the Back Bay Station.
As in the description,the available space in the room is small and it has a single bed. It's probably only best for an overnight or two. If you are very sensitive to smells,then this might not be the best option. The house is old and smells musty and like dog. However,"you can shut the door and it's generally fine in the room.  \"",,
225224,1535883,2012-06-22,2070954,David,"Robert is great.  He is a very helpful and kind man.  He just has what I consider a bit of a book hoarding problem but this only affects corridors, halls and the office room.  The office room has a clean single bed, a fridge and an AC.  This is all surrounded by books, which occupy 80% of the real state.  Robert has a dog.  I know because of the smell, not the noise.  At the beginning I was afraid the smell would be strong in the room but it is not.  In all, when I first got there I was deceived, but once you take into consideration where the place is located, and how nice Robert is, I'd give my experience a good pass.

Robert kept apologizing for the state of the room (it's piled high with books) and the heat, but it was great.  It's a beautiful room, not that hot with the AC, and in a great location.  Robert was a very gracious host, fixing the air conditioner and permitting me to stow some belongings while I arranged my move into a new apartment.  And he's an interesting guy, I had a great time chatting with him about China.  Would definitely recommend!"
225224,1686089,2012-07-11,2497701,Yip Hung,Robert's room definitely provided value for money in terms of its convenient location.  Robert was very accommodating and kind giving me all the insightful advice about where to go and eat.
225224,1708095,2012-07-14,2885827,Jose,Robert is a kind host and lives in a great location.  He looks after you and his place is close to the train station and to lots of restaurants and shops.  I look forward to staying there again on my next visit to Cambridge.
225224,1750534,2012-07-19,1176552,New Here,"Robert makes for a great host: I was in town for a brief business trip and didn't need much time in this room, which he underlined was crammed with books. I didn't find it to be impeding at all however; the space was absolutely enough for what I needed, the amenities were fresh (there was even a fridge next to the bed), and Robert is very genial and quite knowledgeable on the area. Beautiful house... No complaints!"
225224,1824413,2012-07-28,3013653,Michael,"Long, detailed review here!"
I stayed in Robert's 4th floor office room for four nights while in Boston to attend a Liverpool FC soccer match held at Fenway Park.  First,I would like to highlight Robert's communication.  He responded to my initial inquiry in a very swift and clear manner which was really great for me because it was a very last-minute booking.  He then provided me with very detailed instructions on how to reach his house from the airport using the T system,and it was an easy trip to make (although I did board the wrong connecting train on one occasion because I was late due to my plane arriving late and I was rushing,and I didn't double check before I boarded the train).  He also provided me with a list of sights and attractions to see while in Boston,but unfortunately I didn't have time to check any of them out as the primary focus of my trip was to spend as much time attending Liverpool-related events as I could.  When I initially arrived at his house,he gave me a quick tour and told me all the essential information about the accommodation
The accommodation itself is exactly as advertised.  It is indeed an office room,and there are books and files stacked nearly to the ceiling on all four walls,and there are many bags of books and DVDs on the floor.  However,there is a small,cleared,walkable space from the doorway to the bed with plenty of room to put down one's bags and get comfortable.  There's also a cleared
There is sort of a musty smell throughout the house,but in the room this is not the case.  I did not notice a smell in the room.  Stacks of books line the hallways of the house on most if not each of the floors.  This isn't really an issue though because most of a guest's time is spent in the room or out of the house.  Perhaps the most attractive thing about Robert's room is that the house is located right in the Back Bay only a block or two from a T station,and about 1.5 miles from Fenway Park and a short walk to other attractions and sights.  Combine that with the affordable rate for this office room,and you've got a really decent place to stay for a small fraction of what you'd pay at a hotel that is equally well-located.,,
Robert is a kind,insightful man and a great host,and I'd highly recommend him and his room to other Airbnb users looking for a place to crash in downtown Boston,as long as you don't require or expect more than what you read in these reviews.  Robert and his place make for a safe,worry-free Airbnb experience.,
"Thanks Robert!\"",,,,,
225224,2145943,2012-08-30,3284644,Remi,A great place to stay for small fees ! The kitchen is available and very convenient for people who wish to save their money and eat at 'home'. The place is located in the center of Boston and not far from the orange and green line subways.
Robert is a very nice,warm and friendly person,who is always here to answer all my questions and help me in my problems. We shared a lot of experiences,I really appreciated the 9 days !,,
"\"",,,,,
225224,2221749,2012-09-07,2967847,Emma,"I found the previous reviews very useful as the house and the host are as described by most, so consider yourself warned about the piles of books and reviews cluttering the corridors: Robert is absolutely charming and a wonderful host and his historic house is one of a kind. As another room was available, Robert put me up in a more spacious and bright room that was perfect for me, with a desk and wi-fi connection. Now you have to share a bathroom with another guest who may have different hygiene standards, and this you can't really control. I (female guest) also happened to bump into him naked when walking up to use the loo... He was the one who panicked. That's how comfortable some guests feel... I wish Robert the best to keep renovating his wonderful house."
225224,2376531,2012-09-22,3565014,Chalermpan,Robert provide me a lot more about Boston when I first arrived. The room full of books but they didn't annoy me beside they comforted me a lot. I'd love to stay with his book again when I have a chance to go back to Boston.

I am very satisfied of the information and clarification he provided about the housing before I got there and the fast communication while I stayed with him. He was also very accommodating with my demands in terms of dates and to accommodate my needs.
The room is as described with a very comfortable bed albeit crammed room. It is full of books and interesting DVDs which I would love to discover had I had more time.,,,,,
I unfortunately had to shorten my stay due to an unperceived inconvenience: the presence of mosquitoes in the room. However,I am sure that with the colder days ahead,"this will not be a problem at all for those who wish to stay in upcoming weeks. \"",,,
225224,2460702,2012-09-30,2519670,Rod,It was pretty much as I expected based on other's reviews. For me it was like staying at a distant uncle's place. It was cozy in that room - private and safe.  I loved the location in the city. There are some great restaurants and sites to see within easy walking.
I was in Boston for a 2-day conference where I was out each day at 7 am,and back late. So I didn't need anything more than a place to put my head.,,,,

Beautiful-old-typical-Boston house,in a great location..most of the tourist spots are less than 20 minutes by walking,3 minutes walking from Back Bay station..what else?,,,
I got a bigger room than the one expected,lot of space (probably the only one without book :p),it was clean and comfortable,same for the bathroom. I stayed only one night but it would have been perfect for a week too.,,
Nothing else to add,"I really recommend Robert's place!\"",,,,
225224,2896392,2012-11-16,3953774,Raphael,J'ai passé une dizaine de jours très agréable chez Robert au quatrième étage d'un belle maison dans le quartier de South End. La chambre est confortable et la salle de bain grande et propre.
Le quartier de South End est central et assez représentatif du boston chic. De plus on y trouve de nombreux restaurants,bars et magasins. La maison de Robert est proche des principales lignes de métro et on peut également se rendre a pieds dans les quartiers alentours et visiter la Public Library à Copley place,la grande rue marchande Newbury Street ou le quartier de Beacon Hill.,,,
En résumé,séjour très agréable,"emplacement idéal pour visiter Boston.\"",,,
225224,3751013,2013-03-11,1639153,Aaron,"Robert's place is the reason why people use this service rather than renting a hotel- an amazing brownstone stacked floor to ceiling with a staggering book collection and tons of vintage art/ antique furniture everywhere. The room I stayed in was clean, comfortable and private. I could have happily stayed there a month. Robert is a sweetheart of a guy- warm, helpful and smart. My only regret is not having more time to talk to him. Next time-"
225224,3895201,2013-03-25,5379735,Jeffrey,"Robert was a great guy, very friendly and informative. He knows the area well and is ready to help. As other reviews have stated, the house is a bit cluttered, but since I was really only there to pass out at the end of a long day, it didn't really bother me. I originally signed on for the 4th floor office room, but one of the regular renters was out of town, so Robert let me use his first floor room. This was immensely helpful, as I doubt I would have been able to navigate the very slim stairwell with two heaping shoulder bags. As it was, I found myself having to move through the entrance hall sideways to avoid knocking over stacks of books are precariously placed piles on top of shelves. The real joy of the place is its location. It was only 2 blocks from the Back Bay T station and a few more blocks to Boylston Street and the downtown area. Since I was in town for a convention at the BCEC, being right near the subway was extremely helpful. There are also a ton of convenience stores and restaurants nearby. All in all, even though the place is kinda messy and cramped, it is perfect for someone traveling alone who doesn't plan on spending much time in the room. I guess a couple would be fine as well, but the bed I had was pretty tiny, so it might not be the most comfortable fit."

I had the chance to chat a little bit with Robert who is a very kind and gentle person. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants something cheap, quiet and well located."
225224,4308119,2013-04-26,6062764,Euan,"Great stay -- Robert's place has a lot of character and he was really accommodating. I was stuck looking at expensive hotels before being referred to airbnb, and Robert's place came up in a perfect neighbourhood in Boston, accessible to all the city sights, and at such a comparatively low price. Thanks Robert!"
225224,4681139,2013-05-20,3170502,André,"Robert's room was nice, comfortable and clean. He gave me good tips of what to see in Boston and he was very useful. His lodger was very useful and made me feel very comfortable in the house. The house is very well located. My impression was very positive."
225224,4824217,2013-05-27,5280497,Frank,Centrally located in a very nice neighborhood in the South End. Breakfast place at the corner.
Everything went smooth.,,,,,
"Robert has thousand of books.\"",,,,,
225224,4972239,2013-06-04,6442189,Ifeoma,"This place was great!  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the room. It was on the fourth floor and it was very elegantly decorated with a glass chandelier and several paintings on the walls.  The bed was comfortable enough and I appreciated that the room had air-conditioning as I arrived on a day that was very warm! Jacky, Robert's partner, was very helpful. He carried my bags up the flights of stairs (thank you!) and he also showed me points of interests on the map and gave some good advice on how to get around. I shared a bathroom with one other guest but I never saw him and the bathroom was next door to the room so felt pretty private.  The room was clean, tidy and quiet.  And I had a key so I could come and go at my leisure. All in all, a very pleasant stay!"
225224,5136898,2013-06-14,6682403,Martijn,"Although I haven't seen Robert or Jacky at all during my stay due to my busy schedule while in Boston, I could feel their hospitality in many ways: towels, guides to Boston and many more was provided and plentyful. Same for literature; they always have the book for you to read! House and rooms are also in a good state and royal indeed. Definitely recommendable to anyone who looks for a royal and affordable place in Boston!"
225224,5433722,2013-06-30,6159974,Josh,"Robert's house was perfect for my needs. It was an amazing place filled with books and all sorts. The fourth room was more than suitable, but midway through my stay I was offered a much grander room on the 3rd floor. I didn't meet Robert, but he and Jacky were really communicative and helpful via email and face to face. I have no complaints and recommend them highly."
225224,5520359,2013-07-03,4475777,Isern,"Staying at Robert's was really great. I send the request the same day, 12 hours before travelling to Boston. I arrived late (3AM) and we figured it out to be able do the check-in. My stay was really short but I liked the place, it was perfect to crash and walk around the city. Thanks!!"
225224,5590737,2013-07-07,7058825,Yemi,"As a first time user of Airbnb, I was  not sure if staying in someones house was a very good idea. But I was wiling to give it a chance. Staying with Robert is like staying at home! The house is super comfortable and right in the middle of everything you will ever need (or want) in Boston. Even though I booked a small and cheap room in the fourth floor of the house, Robert gave me a very nice spacious room in the ground floor which i think is a very nice thing to do. Oh yes! I wanted to spend a night before I move to New London, and had limited time to see things around Boston. So when I spoke to Robert, he helped me identify quickly what will be worth visiting within a short period of time and I was pleased to have had a 5mins(useful) conversation with him."
On the other hand,I think the house could use a little tidiness. The room that I stayed was okay and clean but there is just too much stuff(mostly books) around the house that you would have to find a way through it. The kitchen also is not so pleasing(though I didn't use this at all),,,,
Overall,I think it is a perfect house for anyone that wants to be safe and staying a few or longer nights in Boston. If you want the an hospitable  person to stay with,"stay with Robert.\"",,,

After reading some reviews that weren't completely positive, I had doubts... but after staying there, I think whoever wrote those are critiquing the room as though it were a hotel... and it's not. It's a lived-in home.  Overall, very good experience!"

The bed is a big squishy but OK. When I arrived, I was greeted by Jacky who carried my suitcase up the stairs to my room. Robert was very communicative via email so I felt like I was being taken care of. The location is great, easy walking distance to the downtown area. Overall positive experience."
225224,7462418,2013-09-21,8302705,Ronald,"Robert was very kind and helpful.  He shared a map of Boston with me, gave me some tips on where to go to see the sites, and upgraded my room at no additional cost (as there was a last minute vacancy.  The location is great."
225224,8054885,2013-10-14,8960519,Enzo,Thanks to Robert and Jacky! They are very nice guys who gave me good advices on where to go and what to see and are also very nice to talk to. The room was clean and filled with lots and lots of books!! I didn't mind that since I was on a conference all day and rather enjoyed the short distance to downtown. I would definately go there again!
225224,8174110,2013-10-19,9069796,Nadine,"The room is overcrowded with books as described in the ad, but it therefore has a special ambiance, which I liked. I can recommend that room for a short stay (I spent there 5 nights) as the house is situated very conveniently in downtown Boston. And Robert and Jacky are wonderful hosts; amongst others very helpful with providing information about the town and assisting with the baggage. I had a great time. Thank you."
225224,11162778,2014-03-23,8730646,Luozhou,"It is very nice to stay in Robert's apartment, which is ancient-styled. It is very close to orange line and back bay station. I could recommend others to stay there for a few days!"
225224,11717012,2014-04-13,12964388,Rick,This was my first Airbnb experience and I couldn't have been happier. Robert was gracious and offered directions where I had to go the next day. The room was just as described and was very pleasant and quiet. Books everywhere added to the character. Thank you for a great stay.
225224,12145150,2014-04-24,8978955,Emily,We absolutely loved our stay with Robert. He was a very gracious and helpful host. He was extremely accommodating and flexible regarding our stay. Robert was very helpful in providing us with local sightseeing and travel information. Very centrally located to all of downtown and historical sights in Boston. The beauty of his brownstone and his massive book collection were very charming and added to our experience in Boston.  We would definitely stay with him again in a heartbeat. Thank you Robert for the wonderful stay and the lifelong memories!
225224,12225383,2014-04-26,7636322,Michael,"Robert's house is less than 5 minutes on foot from Back Bay Station. The neighbourhood is fantastically lively and green and close to shops/restaurants. The house is amazingly big, there are many books in it but add a charming touch to his place. I was supposed to get the room on the 4th floor, but due to a cancellation I got another room without any extra fee ! The room was beautifully decorated, with a bed, vintage furniture (desk, sofa, chairs) and had a chimney (not usable but cute). Robert was very inviting the instant we met and gave me a lot of advice to where I should go during my stay and the things to see. Having a history background, he told me a lot about the history of the city (which is rather amazing). The only problem I had was that I didnt find the heater and was a bit cold. Overall, I had a very pleasant stay and recommend Robert as a host !"
"Thanks again !\"",,,,,
225224,12309837,2014-04-28,14377784,Gregor,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great. I met Jackie and Robert the first evening and had a nice chat with both, got good tips for exploring Boston. They accommodated me in a better than booked room, gave me a big towel and showed me the room. The house is full of books which I find very charming. All in all, I can only recommend the accommodation and Robert."
225224,12490743,2014-05-04,11082285,Michael,Thank you for Robert. This was the ideal stay for my visit to Boston for a conference. I was primarily gone the entire day but Robert made sure I had the information I needed.

225224,12998971,2014-05-17,6925808,Mijal,Great! I agree to all the awesome comments bellow. If I go back to Boston I will defiantly stay there again!
225224,13557664,2014-05-30,14726387,Adrienne,"Robert was very nice, very intelligent, and very helpful! More importantly, his house was amazingly interesting. The room was in the top floor of his Back Bay brownstone, and was filled to the brim with books and other odds and ends. Know that this is what you're going in to; it's definitely not a hotel, but a unique place to stay in a great location."
225224,13594713,2014-05-31,779705,Jonathan,"Robert was a nice, quickly responsive host.  I needed a place to stay in Boston and he responded within 20 minutes of my request.  When I arrived, his assistant Jackie very nicely helped me with my luggage up the stairs.  I had several business meetings the next day and needed a suit ironed and they provided me with an iron and ironing board.  I would love to stay there again if I needed a place to stay for a night or two.  Wifi was also very fast.  The bed is small, so don't expect you'll sprawl out, but even as a 6'3 210# guy I had no difficulties sleeping on it as it was comfortable.  The only potential drawback one could have is there isn't room to work from the room beside the bed as the room is generally covered with books."
225224,13982207,2014-06-09,13711346,Maisie,"The location is a few blocks away from Copley square and Back Bay Station. Coming from the airport, it was quite convenient to walk only  a few blocks from the Logan express drop off point. Robert was helpful and offered guidance on the sights and attractions of Boston. The house is filled to the brim with books, which adds to the character of the space."

225224,17706449,2014-08-16,6043339,Maximilian,I stayed here for three nights and was very happy with my choice. The room is exactly as in the description and suited me very well as I was out most of the time sightseeing. Upon my arrival I met Robert (who gave me alot of Information on what to do in Boston and supplied me with maps) and Jackie (who helped me with my heavy luggage). The room and bath were clean and the house is in a great Location. I can highly recommend this place!

My bag was carried to my room when I arrived and use of shower and air conditioner was carefully explained. Clean sheets were on the bed and a towel was also provided. The neighborhood was nice, even around the train station in the middle of the night felt reasonably safe. The room, bathroom and house overall were great - spacious, clean, functional. The list accurately reflected that there are many books in the room, but it was just right as a place to get a good night's sleep. I could leave early in the morning without a problem."
225224,18774842,2014-08-31,13781426,Kyle,I landed in Boston at 8am without a place to stay. I messaged him and I got a response almost instantly. He agreed to meet me and give me access to the room right away. He provided me with info about Boston and the run-down and then left me alone for the 2 days I was there (though he was accessible if I needed). I even got to check out at 5pm which was really nice.
The room is pretty crowded,but that was in the description. There was enough room for me lay my stuff out and feel comfortable,but not too much more than that. The semi-private bathroom was very nice,"and I was really happy to have the mini-fridge in the room to put some snacks and drinks in. \"",,
225224,18956499,2014-09-03,3178666,Paul,"Outstanding location just southwest of downtown. Beautiful brownstone on a quiet, tree-lined residential street wedged between Back Bay and South End. Orange T station is minutes away, and if you need the Green line, that's an easy short walk right through Copley Square -- majestic day or night no matter how many times you pass back and forth."
Robert is a warm and congenial host who knows Boston inside and out and can make recommendations and provide travel logistics for whatever your needs are. He offers a good historical perspective of the street,the immediate neighborhood and the city at large. He is also very flexible with check-in/out times which is extremely helpful.,,,,

After my arrival, his helpful advice was instrumental for my Boston sight-seeing experience during the remainder of that day. His brownstone town house is located in an attractive residential area, room and facilities were as described in his posting. The location close to Back Bay Station was ideal for my trip's purpose. I'd certainly stay here again."
225224,19211591,2014-09-08,15087458,Thomas,"Very nice stay. Robert took the time to give me an extensive briefing of Boston. After that I could easily select where to go and what to prioritize. Good room and bed. Especially if you like books and if you are out most of the day. Location cannot be better, close to copley sq and easy walking distance to downtown."
225224,19679597,2014-09-16,19173496,Stephen,"Room was as advertised. The owner had one of the other tenants greet me and show me the accommodations. Everyone was very hospitable, and the room was clean and serviceable. Great location. Would stay here again."

225224,19895718,2014-09-20,20858132,Sachin,"Rob is a great host and certainly the room that I stayed in was well worth the $80 or so that I paid at the time.  The house is completely filled with books (literally thousands) on each floor and room which is really something to see.  Could be an issue if you have allergies to dust though.  Room was generally comfortable, and Rob provided me with a copy of the key to get around.  The house is located just a few blocks away from Hynes convention center so, great for that."
My only major concern - many rooms in the house are simultaneously AirBNB'ed with different guests - so at any given time there are a lot of people entering and leaving the house.  While the only other AirBNB'er that I met was a very nice lady who happened to be a librarian,it is my feeling that over a long period of time,with so many people coming and leaving,there's a real chance that a bad apple may pass through and it may be to the detriment of both the host and / or another AirBNB'er.  For someone staying a night or two,not bringing much valuables,and maybe traveling with another person
For someone traveling by themselves (particularly a woman),bringing valuable things,or staying for many nights - I would at least ask Rob how many other AirBNBers are staying that weekend,and how he may have vetted them.,,
"Rob is personally a great host from the limited time that I was at his house. \"",,,,,
225224,20633738,2014-10-02,5536112,Sachin,"Robert is a great host! My hotel reservation got cancelled the night before I was supposed to get into Boston. A friend suggested using Airbnb and I found Robert's place closest to where I had to be for an imporant work commitment the following day. Not only did he immediately pre-approve my request, but also gave me detailed directions to find my way around. His is a nice warm home with his penchant for books evident from several of them neatly stacked on all floors of the house. The location is perfect and a walking distance from the back bay train station, cafe's, restaurants and the city's historical sites (Trinity Church and The Boston Library). The room is just as described and I was definitely impressed by the clean bed and amenities. Overall, the comfortable room, safe and central location, flexible check in-check out hours and Robert's hospitality made my first Airbnb stay a pleasant one. I would definitely stay again!"
225224,22020424,2014-10-28,12434136,Bill,"Do not expect the Copley Plaza. On the other hand, do not expect to pay Copley Plaza rates. I saved $1200 over what I would have paid in a Copley Square hotel. Budget accommodations at budget rates, clean, with live-in grad student Jackie hefting my bags up and down four flights of stairs. Books everywhere you look -- this has to be seen to be appreciated -- but I do mean everywhere. Actually, the books were something of a distraction: I kept pulling individual books out and reading them when I should have been in bed. Great location: two or three blocks from Copley square. Robert was a pleasure to meet and talk with. All things considered, I got what  paid for. And I'd go back."
225224,22289286,2014-11-03,9775984,Nicole,For future guests -- important things I would have liked to have known:
Easy 7 minute walk to Copley Square.,,,,,
Less than 5 minutes to Back Bay T station.,,,,,
Feels safe.,,,,,
*Shared bath*. Hot water not always available at high-use times.,,,,,
Multiple guests at one time in different rooms.,,,,,
No lock on bedroom door,and front door not always locked.,,,,
(Gives an easygoing feel,but not everyone will feel comfortable.),,,,
Plenty of blankets (nice and toasty).,,,,,
Sunny room. (Though don't take that to mean there is a view. ;),,,,,
Refrigerator (nice),good indoor lighting,cd player/radio.,,,
Experience:,,,,,
Robert communicated quickly and clearly all the information I needed for travel to his place. When he learned I was driving in,he made some suggestions for parking,because one cannot park in the neighborhood.,,,
I had to change my plans and come at a later day and time and he and his housemateJaqui (whose name I am still not sure how to spell -- sorry J!)  accommodated that easily.,,,,,
I didn't get to meet Robert,but J was super nice and friendly. He insisted that when I dropped off my bag on the way to my conference,I should leave it at the bottom of the (rather narrow and steep) 3 flights of stairs so he could take it up.,,,
Location:,,,,,
Terrific,certainly if you're attending a conference at the nearby Marriot or other hotels. Copley Square is lovely and there are many restaurants and shops nearby,while the immediate area is tree-lined,brick-sidewalk and residential.,,
Place itself:,,,,,
As others say,the house is kind of amazing in its collections (mostly books (20,000...)also sculpture and painting on themes equine and Titanic. It's very comfortable *for a certain sort of temperament.* As one fellow said,it's like staying at your aunt/uncle's house (but without kitchen access.) Things are set up in a haphazard way -- the sort of thing you'd never complain about if you were staying with family (i.e. shared bath is messy,no soap dish,stuff generally everywhere so not much space to put your things
The room:,,,,,
I stayed in the office room,which was fine. The bed was comfortable -- no easy place for clothes or suitcase,but as he says,it's not really a bedroom,just an extra space.,
Overall,I was glad I had a place in the city and not at the expensive and cold hotel. That said,I do think that since you're not staying at your aunt's house (which would be free if your aunt lived in Back Bay),things could be tidier and easier,more guest-focused. OR,leave it as it is
225224,22444091,2014-11-06,3517279,Joe,Good experience. Room was as advertised. It did the job for a one night stay. Robert and those helping in managing the Airbnb reservation were accommodating.

225224,22662963,2014-11-11,6996064,Philip,Had a good experience with Robert; he met me at the door earlier than our pre-arranged time and gave thorough instructions and tips on how to get to my meetings.  There were extra blankets which were nice given that the weather was turning chilly quickly.  All in all a much better alternative than the more expensive nearby hotels.
225224,22718372,2014-11-12,23284108,Franzi,"Robert was really helpful and gave me great recommendations on how to get from the airport to his place before I arrived in Boston. Don't expect it to be a Four Seasons but it was absolutely sufficient for my purposes and it was super uncomplicated and easy going staying there.

225224,26084936,2015-02-02,26814668,Ramkumar,"Robert kept in touch constantly, and never made me wait. He had someone help me with the luggage as I came in. The room was well-kept, comfortable, and private; nothing fancy. My only complaint was that water from ice was dripping at the entrance (the front door was shut, and they were using the basement entrance). The hot water situation could have perhaps been a little better too. Robert himself was a charming host, and gave me a lot of good information as I came into Boston."
225224,27378292,2015-03-02,19298807,Brian,Robert was an excellent host. He gave me a brief history of the city and told me where I should visit. He also responded very quickly and was flexible with check in/out. Everything is within a 20 minute walk and the room was very warm. Would stay again.
225224,27738771,2015-03-10,28364551,David,"I had a great time at Robert's place. It's nicely located in a very good neighbourhood of Boston and close to the city center (or better, in the city center). Robert was helpful when I arrived and gave me good advices what to do. I went to Boston to attend a conference - this is the right choice for his appartment. If you come for partying, you might want to consider another airbnb."
225224,28053747,2015-03-16,12992147,Charles,I had a fantastic experience. Very warm hospitality and prime location.
225224,28141243,2015-03-18,15768913,Antonio,I'm happy to always come back to Boston and stay with Robert. I'm a freelancer from New York and it's so central to my work here and the train and such. I will always recommend it and I'm. Back also this weekend. Thanks again Robert.
225224,28833444,2015-03-30,29579883,Nicola,"I love the place,located near the center few minutes walking from the back bay station. Robert is very kind and helps you out with indications and suggestions."
The rooms are clean and warm...,,,,,
"I will definetly go back there if I have a chance to visit Boston again!!\"",,,,,
225224,29157538,2015-04-05,24570268,Lukas,"Robert hat mir anfangs genau erklärt, wie ich vom Flughafen zur Unterkunft gelange. Dass er an jenem Abend anwesend war, hat das ganze natürlich einfacher gemacht. Super war, dass er mir gleich Unterlagen (Stadtplan etc.) gab und mir dazu einige Tips und Empfehlungen gab. Die Unterkunft ist in einem typischen Reihenhaus. Das Zimmer wie auch grosse Teile des Hauses (Flur etc.) sind voll mit Büchern, so dass es zum Teil ein wenig eng wird. Aufgrund dessen ist der Haupteingang blockiert, weshalb man den unteren, engen Eingang nehmen muss. Je nach Gepäckgrösse kann das ein bisschen schwierig werden. Ich hatte diesbezüglich aber keine grösseren Probleme. Im Zimmer selber ist der Platz etwas beschränkt, aber zum schlafen ist es mehr als ausreichend. Das Bad ist ebenfalls in einwandfreiem Zustand. Alles in allem hatte ich eine gute Zeit in Boston und meine Erwartungen wurden erfüllt."
225224,29457782,2015-04-07,26110520,Phil,"Comfy bed, great location, and friendly hosts."
225224,29536783,2015-04-08,12755345,Clara,"I stayed at Robert's just one night but I really enjoying the time I spent with him! He's such an interesting person to talk to, he knows everything and was very helpful with info about the city."
The room is exactly as described in the apartment,I mean it used to be his office so it's full of stuff,especially books,but I found that very interesting too,since I enjoy seeing how the locals live and what they like. Both the room and bathroom were clean and although other guests were staying in the other rooms,"I had the whole space for myself. I would definitely come back to Robert's if I needed too! Thanks for everything.\""
225224,30486246,2015-04-22,15768913,Antonio,Thanks Robert another great low maintenance stay at ur lovely brownstone. See ya again this weekend.
225224,30933590,2015-04-29,15768913,Antonio,Thanks again for saving my stay again in boston Robert u are the best.
225224,31122077,2015-05-02,22101025,Ginelle,"Robert was extremely easy to contact and very helpful.  He gave me quite a few useful tips about where to go, what to see, and how to get there.  The room was just as described and perfect to drop my bags and head back out.  And the neighborhood was amazing - very safe, very central, and the train was only a few blocks away.  Will definitely try to stay again, if I'm in Boston area."
225224,31389650,2015-05-04,21192256,Kyle,"Robert had one of the most beautiful Boston homes I've ever seen. The place is filled with books and artifacts that give it the most unique look. The fourth floor room is big, but the area you can walk around is small due to books. This was not a problem at all for me and I thoroughly enjoyed looking through all the books and items in the room. Robert is a very nice man and even stayed awake to let me in a 2am because my flight was delayed. I can't speak highly enough about this residence. Stay with Robert!"
225224,31532032,2015-05-06,309762,David,Great location. Charming house. Ask for a bedroom.
225224,31595159,2015-05-07,30979805,Alexander,"Robert was an amazing host. He made my stay felt like home! Since it was my first time at Boston, he recommended a few places for me to visit as well. The room I stayed in was filled with books!"
225224,32221143,2015-05-15,31822494,Julian,"Great location, nice room, very affordable."
225224,32281587,2015-05-16,32173167,Andres,Robert is a great host! He told me the whole story of Boston and gave me useful tips about places to visit. 100% recommended!
225224,32345505,2015-05-17,30167713,Thomas,"I felt very comfortable during my one night stay in Robert's house. The road is very quite, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is clean. Robert responded quickly and he provided me with directions to the house. One of his tenants kindly helped me to bring my luggage to the 4th floor and  Robert gave me many helpful tips for  sightseeing as well as recommendations for cultural events and dining."
The location is very suitable to explore Boston. The Boston library is in walking distance (around 5 minutes) and with the nearby train station (Back Bay,also 5 walking minutes) downtown is just a few stops away.,,,,
Robert was also very generous since he allowed me to store my luggage at the ground floor on the departure day.,,,,,
Overall,I would always like to come back to Robert when visiting Boston and I can highly recommend this place for short trips.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
225224,32561771,2015-05-19,4187910,Mathilde,Vert good location and warm welcome  ! Exactly as described !
225224,32778108,2015-05-21,32758672,Hyunju,"I only stayed one night and had to leave early for my work-related conference next day, so I only briefly met Robert but he was nice and welcoming. He showed me a direction to my meeting place, so I could get there quickly in the morning. The person who was helping Robert was very nice too (Sorry, I forgot his name). They let me leave my luggage with them until the meeting is done, so I didn't need to carry the luggage during the conference."
The neighborhood is nice and quiet. The place is very close to the train station,so it was very convenient.,,,,
"The room is filled with a lot of books as described in Robert's profile. I didn't mind much. Anyway it was only one night stay. It is not like a nice hotel room but it is fine for staying for a short period time. And you are saving a lot of money and staying at a convenient location. The mattress was very comfy. I had a good sleep.\"",,,,,
225224,32965268,2015-05-24,2564723,Ms Jules,"did not communicate only once before arriving, and that was to ask me to not drive my car, but to take a bus or train. Could not change plans with that. Never answered any of my other questions."
225224,33105881,2015-05-25,28020286,Chris,Robert communicated pre-arrival very well.  The room was exactly as described in terms of it being an office turned into a guest room for a short term stay.  There's a small fridge in the room as well.
The decor of the room could be considered quirky,depending on your taste.  All the books and DVDs around the room were interesting.  I'm sure there are some gems hidden in the stacks!  There's a line of stuffed animal pandas and rabbits sitting on the couch next to the bed,which I thought was an interesting touch,,,
The location of this listing was excellent!  It seemed like almost everything was in a decent walking distance.  I walked over to Fenway Park,the Boston Marathon finish line,the library,and out to Freedom trail from here.,,
Checking out was a bit of a challenge,but it wasn't all on the host.  It was never really communicated between the two of us what time I should be out by,and when I was headed to the airport,I couldn't find anyone to leave the key with.  But as I said,that's not all on the host,"I should've communicated and planned ahead beforehand so that could've easily been avoided\""
225224,33437791,2015-05-28,2772432,Natalia And Michael,Hosts were wonderful and had a lot of tips about what to do in Boston and how to get to the airport easily.
House is in a great location,really close to four Hubway (city bike) stations which made it really easy to get around. Always felt safe,which as a traveling solo female is a priority.,,,
"House is crowded with books. I thought it was nice. Not a hotel experience. \"",,,,,
225224,33599391,2015-05-30,14231909,Jody,"Robert's place was in a great location, close to some of my favourite areas in Boston, and with close and very easy access via the subway. Robert and Jacky were both very helpful and accommodating - Robert had great suggestions for restaurants and things to do (and the best way to get there). I'd be pleased to return on future visits to the city."
225224,33960938,2015-06-02,224275,Arnoud,"Great welcome. The house was exactly what you would expect from a professor. Books everywhere! Location is perfect, close to restaurants, bars and shopping"
225224,34019459,2015-06-03,33651464,Ben,"Was offered a better room upon arrival, was greeted with advice on where to spend the evening locally. Slept well, banging early morning from upstairs woke me earlier than I had planned but apart from this everything was on point. Would stay again."
225224,34086932,2015-06-04,13172387,Paul,Robert had been very helpful. He made sure I had directions for finding his place.
Even though I expected an office room. Robert put me in a nicer guest room,with just as many books.,,,,
The house is in a great location,"just minutes walking from Newbury street and Back Bay.\"",,,,
225224,34963869,2015-06-14,24762240,Jose,My stay at Robert's office room was very pleasant. Robert was very friendly and introduced me the history and landmarks of Boston during a nice chat just after my arrival. My flight was late and he contacted me to find out my whereabouts and give me tips about how to reach his place.
225224,35085773,2015-06-15,5090647,Cynthia,"Robert's place was wonderful.  It was conveniently located, clean and sunny.  Both Robert and Jackie were very helpful and gracious hosts."
225224,35320267,2015-06-17,33907841,Jamie,"I had a pleasant stay.  The room was as described.  It was very quiet and in a convenient location.  The property is a short walk from restaurants, shop, major T stop and pubs.   Perfect for single traveler.  Especially if you love books.  It is on the 4th floor so people that have trouble with stairs or exercise should take this into consideration.  Although I only chatted with Robert briefly upon arriving, he was kind and offered help with dinner location and umbrella.  Robert was responsive and helpful to communications prior to visit."
225224,37049907,2015-07-04,32254133,Deborah,"I was given a warm welcome by a friend of the host. Who also provided me with a map of the local area and gave me some information on the local attractions.  The accommodation was as described and the house is in a good location for easy access to the riverside, town and the port."
225224,37351957,2015-07-06,7310742,Barbara,I stayed in this room for two nights.
The room was indeed full of books,but this was not a disadvantage at all. In fact the room was roomier than I imagined from the description. There was plenty of space for me and my luggage. The bathroom is on the same floor as the room and is now equipped with a lock.,,,,
Unfortunately,I did not get to meet Robert,but Jackie was an excellent host! He carried my luggage up to the 4th floor and gave me tips on what to do and see in Boston. He quickly replied to my questions I had during the weekend.,,,
The place is at a great location,just three blocks away from the next subway station. And basically anything is in a walkable distance.,,,,
I highly recommend Roberts place and would stay there again,"if I get to Boston again.\"",,,,
225224,37681751,2015-07-09,27122500,Miki,It's an authentic Bostonian house with brick walls in a very convenient location. Correspondence w Richard was easy and he was very accommodating. They put me in a bigger room as it was available.
225224,37983928,2015-07-12,34197167,Lauro,Robert is a very nice person. Thanks
225224,38124544,2015-07-13,9604213,Andrea,"I had been at Robert's place last year, and I returned this year."
That says it all,"I think.\"",,,,
225224,38359489,2015-07-14,7240941,Dena,"I wasn't able to meet Robert, but JaQi was very welcoming and kind. The neighborhood felt very safe and quiet, despite proximity to Bay Bay. Robert was very responsive via Airbnb messages, and I greatly appreciated his flexibility in making the room available despite short notice!"
225224,38853625,2015-07-19,6965434,Paul,everthing nice. thx to robert and jackie
225224,39114001,2015-07-20,22963460,Joke,"The house is located in a fine Boston heritage area close to all facilities and downtown. Robert welcomed me and his assistant showed me my bedroom on the 4th floor. My comfortable bed was surrounded by an amazing collection of books and paraphenalia in a large room of 25 m², such that I had 3 m² to get around. The washroom matched the standing of the house. I slept well that night."
225224,39775242,2015-07-26,34513092,Napat,Robert is a very good host. He prepared a free map and introduced me to a very beautiful city. He helped me plan how to spend time after conference exploring the city and also told a story of Boston.
His place is very close to my conference hall,just 15 mins walk. It is also very close to Backbay station where I can take subway to anywhere in Boston and Cambridge. My 4th floor room is full of books but it is not a big deal. I just have to share bathroom with another guest. Check-in and check-out time is flexible. Overall,"I like this place. It is very convenient to public transportation. The host is very nice. The rent is decent comparing to other hotels nearby. And I will definitely book this room for my next trip to Boston.\"",,,
225224,40160228,2015-07-28,1338711,Neil,"Perfect location, great reading material!"
225224,40936211,2015-08-03,34584982,Helena,"The neighborhood was peaceful and very close to Back Bay station, which made it very convenient for travelling. It's also close to Newbury Street and Prudential centre, so all of your shopping needs should be satisfied."
The room was cozy and comfortable-- the air conditioning was much appreciated in the heat!,,,,,
"Robert was very courteous and even suggested an activity or two for the evening.\"",,,,,
225224,41768781,2015-08-09,35702611,Danielle,Robert is very helpful in giving tips of where to visit in Boston. I got to watch King Lear in Boston Common when I first arrived in Boston. His apartment is within walking distance to the Back Bay (orange line) and Copley (green line) and very close to the Trinity church and Copley Plaza Hotel where my meeting venue is. A very lovely stay in Boston despite my busy meeting schedule. Highly recommended.
225224,42138856,2015-08-11,2461593,Chris,"Robert was very nice in welcoming me. He gave me instructions for getting to his home via public transit. When I arrived, he asked what my interests were and gave me some suggestions for places to visit in Boston. His home is very nice (I love seeing all the books), and the location is excellent."
225224,42637877,2015-08-14,40702500,Kevin,"Great host, great neighborhood, good room!"
Easy 2 block walk to Back Bay subway station and another block to Copley Square.  Air conditioned and clean,"but a little cluttered.  Host gave excellent sightseeing suggestions and had a great deal of Boston knowledge that he was willing to share without being overly chatty.  Nice neighborhood location with a few popular restaurant/bars around the corner.  Will stay again next time I visit Boston!!! \"",,,,
225224,42785986,2015-08-15,8986680,Nadine,"I booked the office room, yet a bigger room was available so I was upgraded to the 'sunny room', which was clean, bright and spacious. The bed was comfy too, the bathroom right next door. The location is great, very quiet, and within easy walking distance from all major sights and the Back Bay station. Perfect for my short stay. Robert was very helpful and flexible with check-in and check-out times."
225224,43837203,2015-08-22,6103682,Eric,"Robert was extremely welcoming and his place was perfect for me. A great location, wonderful recommendations, and an easy in and out process were just what I needed. I would be happy to stay again next time I come to Boston!"
225224,46172625,2015-09-08,40959037,Ernesto,"I didn't get to meet Robert but Jacky was very helpful, flexible and courteous during my stay. The room was exactly what I was expecting and I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. It was kind of cool to rest surrounded by so many books! Definitely recommended."
225224,47277430,2015-09-17,41746765,Sandeep,Robert is a great host and listed the places to visit. His house is conveniently located close to subway station.
225224,48079856,2015-09-23,39906355,Luc,A place with a special charm  and well located.
225224,48570520,2015-09-27,5145496,Paul,"Host was very flexible, staying up past midnight to welcome me.  Room was very cheap in relation to local hotels in the Back Bay area.  Area is very quiet despite being just yards from a main road.  Free wifi."
However,while I was warned that this was a bed in an office,I had no idea that the room would be full of books,and I mean full.  I expected a desk to be able to work at,but it too was covered.  There was a bed and a couple of chairs,"but no curtains on the windows which meant I woke up at 5am each day.  Had I not had a full social program and only needed somewhere to sleep I would have been unhappy.\""
225224,48819918,2015-09-28,43949751,QingJia,Robert was not in house and his student received us. Overall the room is good and we enjoyed the books pretty well.
225224,49371431,2015-10-03,28590129,Howie,"Robert is a gracious host. He made sure I was met at the house to check in. If you're looking for cozy and historic, in the middle of the city, less than two blocks from the back bay train station, historic Copely Square, shopping and dining, this is your spot."
225224,50635642,2015-10-13,36375593,Jenn,"Location is wonderful, safe, lovely, quiet street, within walking distance of Copley Square and other major attractions. Robert recommended checking out the New England Conservatory's free nightly events, which afforded me the opportunity to attend the Boston Cello Quartet's exceptional performance in Jordan Hall. This is why I love AirBnB, in general, as connecting with real people rather than a hotel employee creates more unique experiences that one would miss out on otherwise. Robert was kind and accommodating of my last minute notification of travel plans, allowing me to add on a third day last minute and stow my bags in the room after a Red eye flight. Description is accurate--this is an office with many unshelved, books stacked everywhere. The room is literally full of stuff. If clutter bothers you, or you prefer the sameness and banality of a sterile room, or if you cannot tap into the eccentric parts of yourself, then this is definitely not the space for you. If on the other hand you don't mind things a little bit quirky and cluttered, then this is your ideal location for tapping into a more authentic, Bostonian experience."
225224,50908903,2015-10-15,7240941,Dena,"Robert was very flexible about the arrival time, easy-going and friendly. This is not my first time staying with this host, but in particular this time, I enjoyed our conversations about English literature! The room was clean, the neighborhood safe, and the location ideal."
225224,51307146,2015-10-19,2162670,Bill,"It was fine for just myself in for one night, I stayed in the office bedroom that is cool because it's surrounded by books...reminded me of the last time I stayed in Boston in a Harvard professor's home, also piled high with books! I'd stay again, a fun room on a great street in the back bay"
225224,51765714,2015-10-24,26557568,Margot,Robert was lovely and very informative having great advise for the site seer on a budget.  It was easy to find and fitted the description beautifully.
225224,52653690,2015-10-31,20533854,Shaun,"This place was absolutely ideal for my needs. Very close to Copley Square, in a beautiful old brownstone house in a quiet residential street. Robert and his student lodger were very helpful. The room is actually quite large (main top floor room at front of house, not an attic room), it's just very filled with books so you have a single bed and enough space around it for suitcase etc. For my one night it was perfect."
225224,53107553,2015-11-05,10576782,Paul,"This space was so charming and great fun.  This was on the third floor of a brick row house - an amazing location near Copley Place.  Easy access to the Logan Airport shuttle. It is a small space, perfect for one person; the shared bath is clean and convenient.  I was very satisfied!"
225224,53334555,2015-11-08,43516694,Lisabeth,This was the perfect spot for an overnight stay while studying in Boston over the weekend.
I was upgraded to a larger,comfortable,bay-windowed 3rd floor room furnished with an amazing array of Victorian furniture,books and Chinese art. The house is eclectic and cozy. Architecture lovers will love it.,,
The area is full of young urban families and very safe. Back Bay train station is minutes away,making this a perfect base of operations for getting anywhere in the city.,,,,
When I arrived,Jackie generously carried my bag up to the room and explained where everything was. My stay was short,"but I will be back.\"",,,
225224,53846205,2015-11-13,5378657,Kathy,"Robert was super welcoming; he shared with me restaurants that I visited and a free art exhibit happening while I was there. He also told me about the Logan Express bus, which was super convenient."
I didn't realize that Robert has multiple room availability in his house. Because I had incurred an injury prior to arriving,he put me in a wonderful room on the second floor. It was very comfortable and clean. Robert is a true book and art aficionado. He has thousands of books. Unfortunately,I was so busy I had no time to peek at the titles.,,,
The house was about four blocks from Copley Square. It was very centrally located and easy for Uber to find. My GPS originally told me it was on the opposite side of the street,which was momentarily disconcerting. Robert came out a greeted me.,,,,
I took the T and used Copley Station,but I think Back Bay is just as close.,,,,
"I am glad to have had the opportunity to stay here and appreciated Robert's hospitality very much.\"",,,,,
225224,54367343,2015-11-19,2698359,Harold,"Attending a conference at the Marriott Copley Place, this Air BnB was a perfect location @ half the price of the conference rooms & more flexible check-in & check-out hours. So many restaurants & excellent public transit options within a few blocks!"
225224,54664212,2015-11-22,49119936,Yingxiao,it s good!
225224,55780639,2015-12-06,43134137,Charya,"I loved staying at Dr. Robert's place, during a conference at Hynes. It was very close to Hynes, like an 8-10 min walk and you can walk through the Prudential shopping center, so it's safe even at night. When I arrived, Robert told me I can take the first floor room instead of the 4th floor. It was a charming spacious room and I loved staying in it. We had a little trouble with the central heating but Robert provided an excellent space heater so it was nice and toasty in the room. The room was very clean as was the bathroom down the hall. I shared the bathroom with another guest, but was never inconvenienced. Dr. Robert is such a great host, very sweet and friendly. If I go to Boston again, I'll be staying there once more!"
225224,56311949,2015-12-12,7421987,Catrina,Robert was a great host. He took the time to give me directions of the area and gave some recommendations of places to visit. Room was very cozy!
225224,64933958,2016-03-09,3458457,Brian,"Excellent location and an even better host. Robert took the time when I first arrived to share tips around the city and the basics of staying there (bathroom, checking out, wifi, etc). From there he gave plenty of space and I felt comfortable. Definitely worth staying, walkable to nearly everywhere."
225224,66068874,2016-03-19,59792444,Adrian,Robert was great. Very accommodating when I had a late arrival and kept a very clean room and bathroom. No complaints and would definitely visit his place again.
225224,67134258,2016-03-27,22085177,Eddie,"Although I did not spend a lot of time in the house, it was a great experience for me. Robert waited for my late check in at mid night just to make sure I did not get lost. The place is pretty closed to Copley square within 5-10 minutes walk. While the surrounding environment is quiet and peaceful. Luckily I had a brief chat with Robert at the end of the stay. A comfortable stay indeed."
225224,68693317,2016-04-06,54126234,Kevin,I just recently stayed in the 4th floor office for 7 nights while attending a function at the Marriott Copley and I couldn't ask for a more convenient location to the hotel and also the Back Bay station. The only issue I had was the narrow steps and spaces throughout the house. I had a large 45lb. suitcase and had a hard time going up and down the stairs. But other than that I didn't mind it for the price. If you're on the larger side and easily awaken with light coming in the room then the 4th filler office is not for you.

225224,72647565,2016-05-04,4581343,Luciana,"I could live in Robert's neighborhood forever. It's just so beautiful and close to everything. Robert is very intelligent and sweet - I wish I had stayed more than one day so I could talk more with him. I booked  the 4th floor room, but he was kind enough to switch me to another room - bigger and with a fireplace. He lives in a pre war brownstone and I don't reccomend it if you have any disabilities, because there are a lot of narrow steps - or any trouble with books, because he has lots and lots of them ;-)"
225224,73002201,2016-05-06,50053466,Timothy N.,Robert was very welcoming when I arrived and even offered to put me in a more comfortable room for part of my stay. The room had everything I needed and nothing I didn't. It worked well for a business trip where I was going to be out all of the day. It's a great location for walking to many destinations and transportation was very easy.
225224,74157814,2016-05-13,7715184,Susanne,"lovely stay, room as expected...full of books :-) didn't bother me. clean bathroom, quit, excellent location, Robert is the perfect host, gives infos about where to eat, sightseeing tips, supermarket etc.. would choose it again"
225224,75365072,2016-05-21,56403371,Amit,Great neighborhood and excellent host
225224,75790414,2016-05-23,6719278,Michael,"Robert was wonderful! Very convenient location, small cozy room with tons of awesome books around -- it's a bit like staying in a library hotel :)"
225224,78273591,2016-06-06,75609606,Jamie,"Very kind and helpful; showed me around the house, gave directions to the house and recommended places to visit in the city. Room was great, although I got upgraded to a better room"
225224,78917318,2016-06-10,35224791,Oscar,Everything was great! Robert was out this week but Jacky help me with everything. He  was super attentive and even gave me a better room than the one that I reserved. Location is great to walk everywhere or take the public transportation. I will be back for sure.
225224,79419953,2016-06-12,57505018,Yuki,"I very much enjoyed staying at Robert's place--it was comfortable, beautiful and within walking distance from the Museum of Fine Arts and other major parts of Boston I also loved the fact that airport shuttles stop very close from his place. Thank you so much for hosting me!"
225224,81240872,2016-06-21,57132396,Mars,Mi experiencia en el departamento de Robert fue excelente!
225224,82374847,2016-06-27,33446289,Megan,Great stay! Charming neighborhood.
225224,82657178,2016-06-28,58113189,Sara,"At the time of my travel, Robert was out of town so I met with Jacky. He was very nice and responsive."
225224,83962270,2016-07-04,64811155,Amy,"Location was perfect; neighborhood nice and quiet. The house is very eclectic. Robert isn't kidding when he says there are a lot of books! I ended up staying in a different room than the office, which was very comfortable. Nice and spacious, comfy bed, with all I needed. Unfortunately, Robert was away, but Jacky took great care of me. I would absolutely stay there again!"
225224,85089911,2016-07-10,64094795,Ilan,"Convenient, nice place with lots of character. Lovely neighborhood."
225224,86181344,2016-07-15,50876417,Constantine,This is such a cool airbnb. It's like a palace of knowledge. It is basically a small bed and then stacks of books all around. Wifi and AC both worked great. Robert was very friendly. Location was perfect for me as it was walking distance to the Back Bay train station.
225224,87309010,2016-07-19,79465829,Carrie,"This is an excellent value for anyone seeking modestly-priced accommodation within walking distance of Copley Square.  The entry to the property is narrow, but once inside, there is plenty of elbow room.  I can't comment on the office room itself as I was upgraded to a different room.  The room I occupied was clean and comfortable as was the bathroom, which featured a beautiful new tile shower enclosure (I agree with an earlier reviewer that a robe hook in the bathroom would have been nice, but in the grand scheme of things, this is a very small issue).  Robert and Jackie were both very kind and helpful, answering all of my trip-planning questions promptly, providing maps and neighborhood information upon my arrival, and interesting conversation on a wide range of topics during my stay.  Parking in the immediate area appears to be limited to residents, but there is a clean, well-lit parking garage just a couple of blocks away.  The neighborhood was active during the day, quiet at night.  A sweet little park at the end of the block was a lovely place to people-watch on a summer evening."
225224,88397359,2016-07-24,77279109,Kate,"As an Airbnb newbie, I couldn't be happier with every aspect of my experience staying at Robert's beautiful home."
All communication was prompt,professional and included very helpful travel details. Jackie gave me a warm welcome when I arrived and showed me to my upgraded room - ground floor,spacious,desk/TV/couches/chairs,wifi,AC. On the second night
I was thrilled to have access to the kitchen,where I used the kettle on the first day and Robert brought me my own kettle to my room thereafter - I could enjoy tea in my room,perfect.,,,
The location is superb for transport,city sights and the neighborhood is classic upscale Boston.,,,,
A very relaxed and respectful atmosphere,the household seems to attract professionals and mild-mannered tourists.,,,,
Robert and Jackie couldn't have done more to help make my 5 nights more comfortable.  I was lucky to spend a couple of hours conversing with Robert on all manner of subjects - one fascinating gentleman.,,,,,
This is a very cool property,run by the perfect hosts. An entirely positive and memorable experience all round.,,,,
"Thanks Robert and Jackie! \"",,,,,
225224,89070863,2016-07-26,16294222,Ash,Clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again! Great location. Funny office room with lots of books and statues! Loved it.

225224,93877588,2016-08-14,70778865,Jimmy,"Professor Robert was waiting for me when I got there. For the first night, the room that I had booked wasn't available as the previous guest had overstayed - but he compensated by giving me a room that was better than what I originally booked. He also provided me with directions and useful information on what I shouldn't miss in Boston during my stay."
I was in town for only a week and had to spend most of my time at a conference - just 3 blocks away from this house. So,"the location was perfect for me. Very clean and well maintained. Would stay again. \"",,,,
225224,94026808,2016-08-14,19579193,Daniela,"I had a wonderful 1-day stay in an unique style apartment close to many visitor's points of interest in Boston ( Boston Public Library, Common Visitors Center, the Public Garden etc.)."
Robert is an extremely polite,knowledgeable and friendly host.,,,,
"He gave me some very useful advice how to organize my sightseeing tour during my so short stay in the city.\"",,,,,
225224,95978770,2016-08-21,87921818,Justin,Robert made me feel welcomed and even stayed up late for my arrival when my flight was delayed. He gave me good directions and excellent recommendations for local restaurants etc.
225224,96890388,2016-08-24,8855392,Norah,"Staying at Robert's means you get to be welcomed in a lovely, clean and authentic home in a very nice area (quiet and green) of Boston, still within walk-able distance of everything you might want to see or do during your visit. Since the bigger room wasn't booked for the days I was there I got an upgrade (but I would also recommend the office room). The facilities provided are great and the AC worked perfectly. Upon my arrival Robert was very helpfull and provided me with useful information on what I shouldn't miss in Boston, tailored to my wishes. I had a lovely time and would defenitely stay again! Thanks for having me!"
9197535,55436362,2015-12-01,47789956,Søren,"All good, as described and in a nice area in walking distance from most places."
9197535,69322420,2016-04-10,25087809,Raquel,"Perfect location, in a good street near shops, restaurants and the T station of back bay. The room is big and although is separated of the rest of the apartament by a curtain it feels really private."
9197535,72781844,2016-05-04,2388228,Robin,"I didn't gets to meet Leah, as she was away for the period I was there. But her (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) were certainly friendly, The room is indeed quite spacious, and the location is certainly very convenient."
13671334,93362810,2016-08-12,69540371,Matthew,Everything was amazing and clean. No AC on a really hot day was rough but felt like our home away from home. I'd come again
13671334,93630949,2016-08-13,86328037,Rachel,"Nice space, good location, easy & quick communication."
13671334,94673208,2016-08-16,56497874,Grace,"Kevin was very quick to respond with any questions I had. The internet wasn't working at first (not his fault), and he was very helpful in getting it fixed as quickly as possible. Close to some nice restaurants and bars. Great size and easy to park.  It was close to a busy street which was loud at night with large trucks, but ear plugs worked well. Also, there is no A/C, so it was pretty hot even with a fan. I'm sure it would be a perfect place when the weather is cooler."
13671334,96302021,2016-08-22,7333074,Ken,"Staying at this apartment was a great experience. Kevin was very communicative, and the check-in/check-out procedure was very easy and flexible. The apartment itself is clean, modern and comfortable. I was afraid it would be a bit difficult to get around for sightseeing at first, but there are to metro stops within a 10-15 min walk and the MBTA is quite reliable, so we were able to reach anywhere in the city within a half hour. Would definitely recommend."
14218904,91735693,2016-08-06,14962139,Paul Et Valérie,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

2842124,13233247,2014-05-22,2908322,Erica,Peter was great! His apartment was clean and in an amazing area. He even helped me out with a phone charger since I had left mine behind. Would absolutely stay here again!
2842124,17750403,2014-08-17,72087,Amy,I stayed in Peter's apartment for 7 weeks when I was in Boston for a course.
The apartment was charming,clean,perfectly furnished and was in the best location.  You're within walking distance to the Freedom Trail,Haymarket and Fanueil Hall.  There is also no shortage of good food in the area and there's always something going on in the North End!  The subway was also within 5 minutes walking distance.,,
Peter was a great host.  He was quick to respond to any questions or concerns I had.,,,,,
Just be aware that it's on the 4th floor with no elevators.  Make sure you don't bring any big luggage :),,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2842124,18157455,2014-08-22,19746385,Liam,"I can't recommend Peter's place enough. Its just 10 minutes from the Quincy Market area (my favourite place in Boston) and in the cool 'Little Italy' area that I didn't know before my stay. It's clean and simple and just what we needed. This was my first airbnb experience and I'm incredibly happy- Peter was a great host. Quick replies and very helpful. Proven by the fact he let me book my stay the afternoon it started, and even came to Quincy to meet me and walk me back to the apartment. Living next door with his family he was always there to help if we needed it, or a phone call or email away. Upon leaving for San Fran, he even went to the effort of sending me an email with tons of suggestions of what to do."
Great guy,great place with a sick skyline view and a great experience. Book it,"you won't regret it. I know I'll be back when I'm back in Boston.\"",,,
2842124,18453376,2014-08-26,827918,Catelyn,I highly recommend staying at Peter's when you visit Boston.
My brother,sister and I stayed here for a long weekend. It was the perfect location to walk to all of the Boston sites and right in the heart of the North End so we had some awesome Italian food every night and only had a short walk to return.,,,,
"Peter was an awesome host. He accommodated our arrival and departure schedule and was quick to respond when we had a need in the apartment. He also made some great recommendations on places to see and where to eat during our visit.\"",,,,,
2842124,21822549,2014-10-25,18595121,Fabio,"Our stay in Boston was perfect thanks to Peter. He is a great host, the apartment is exactly as announced, and he helped us when we needed it. He was always available when we wanted to contact him. The neighborhood is beautiful and very safe, I would not want to stay anywhere else if i went back to Boston. I recommend everybody to book with Peter."
2842124,21968321,2014-10-27,389787,Sarah,We had a wonderful stay!  Our host was so accommodating and flexible with our schedule.  The location was perfect and offered a great opportunity to enjoy one of the best neighborhoods in Boston.

2842124,24596880,2014-12-31,20420331,Yashodha,Peter was a fantastic host. Very friendly and welcoming. Always available to help out of provide information about Boston and things to do.
The apartment is beautiful,clean,tidy and has everything you need for a great stay in Boston. The location is perfect and a short walk to the restaurants and shops of the North End.,,,

2842124,46293412,2015-09-09,22369241,Jean-Baptiste,Great place!!
NorthEnd is one of the best neighborhood in Boston: lively,safe and close to everything.,,,,
The flat itself is spacious,clean and full of charm. Everything is here. Perfect for a couple with or without kids (sofa bed in the living room). Peter and his wife were reactive,pleasant and always ready to help.,,,
"Thank you both!\"",,,,,
2842124,47371671,2015-09-18,13973313,Trish,The neighborhood is what made our stay wonderful.  Charming neighborhood and I can not say enough about this neighborhood.  It was wonderful.  This is what made our stay at Peters place great.  If Peter does just some little fixes he will never have a problem renting this space.
2842124,47986251,2015-09-22,40511214,Carl,"Peter and his wife were great hosts. Lovely 4th floor walk up exactly as pictured. Wonderful location in North End. Couple of blocks from Hanover and many great places to eat. Close to T, and very walkable to anywhere. Peter was very responsive and available to answer any questions. Great stay!"
2842124,48885862,2015-09-29,39533231,Claire,We had a really nice stay at Peter's apartment. It was very charming and very well situated so we could easily do some sightseeing and go to the Hynes convention center where we had our seminars. It is situated in the italian neighbourhood so it is near a lot of nice restaurants and cafes. Peter and his wife were very welcoming and available when we needed something. We defintely enjoyed our stay there!
2842124,49328612,2015-10-03,40868844,Amy,"\"Location, location, location. We were well situated to walk everywhere, and the North End just oozes charm. If you can handle climbing five flights of stairs, you'll be rewarded with a cozy apartment with exposed brick and beautiful views - a quiet retreat from a bustling city. Perhaps a little light on the amenities - no coffee pot & some more pillows and blankets would've been nice. Three of us fit comfortably, but the sofa sleeper is suitable for someone shorter. My daughter is 5'4\"\" and she had to get a little creative. We didn't meet Peter in person"
2842124,49615304,2015-10-05,40827833,Susan,Wonderful location. Very convenient. Climb up 4 flights of stairs to apartment was hard though! Apartment is small and sparsely furnished so don't expect the same amenities you'd get in a similar priced hotel.
2842124,49991022,2015-10-08,42412667,Bob,"The location is one of the best I have experienced; very easy to access all areas of Boston including subway to points one does not wish to walk.  The location is safe and quiet, and provides quick access to Logan Airport via cab, which we used.  One drawback which our host conveyed before booking was the location does not have an elevator and a 4-story stair climb is required. Aside from the location, another primary reason for the booking was the cost for hotels in Boston is outrageous and having the location at a reasonable cost made our decision much easier."
2842124,50890177,2015-10-15,36578236,David,We had a nice stay at Peter's apartment. The location couldn't have been more perfect and there are good views rewarding you for climbing the four flights of stairs. The amenities throughout were limited/basic.
2842124,52575718,2015-10-31,272052,Marina,"My parents had a great time at Peter's apartment. The unit was pretty, functional, and all essential amenities were provided (plus cable and wi-fi!). The view from the windows was lovely as well."
This was my first time booking through Airbnb and Peter was extremely helpful,"patient and responsive. Climbing the stairs was not always fun but it was definitely worth it.\"",,,,
2842124,53975959,2015-11-15,11244814,Matt,"This apartment is great! It is a good size one-bedroom in the heart of the North End within walking distance to everything (shopping, dining, Boston Garden, Govt Center, etc.) Peter was great to work with and would recommend using him for your nest Boston trip. Place was very clean and he provides everything you need for the visit. Also if you have any questions Peter is very easy to reach and responds within minutes. I will be coming back and using Peter again very soon!"

2842124,62300864,2016-02-13,48101293,Nicholas,"A very interesting-looking, small apartment right in the middle of Boston's rustic North End. The apartment is on the fourth-floor corner of the street, and the view is wonderful. Peter came by to see me in and to explain everything I needed to know."
2842124,69462660,2016-04-11,2051756,Kim,"The apartment is well located, clean and is as described in the write-up.   The apartment is a good value based on location."
2842124,70209028,2016-04-17,27135304,Eric,"Peter was a great host to work with but we did encounter a few issues that lessened our experience. The toilet would not flush for a few days which made it not usable until it was fixed. The location is on the top floor, but even still, noise was a problem. We could hear everything going on outside as if the windows were open and we believe a bird had nested near by so chirping began quite early every day. We had to buy ear plugs to get any sleep. There were ants on the kitchen counter and we even discovered a mouse in the bathroom. Peter was very responsive to our problems, but we still would have preferred to be without them. A good note for the apartment is it is in a great location so walking to places was easy. Overall we enjoyed our time in Boston, but had more issues than we expected."
2842124,71160868,2016-04-24,53962665,Susan,"\"We were extremely happy with our accommodations in the north end of Boston. Peter was excellent at responding to questions and making suggestions on where to eat etc. The location is close to everything you would want to see in Boston and within a 5 minute walk to the TD Gardens, with easy access to the subway. You are right in the middle of the Italian quarter and it is alive with restaurants, lots of character and awesome bakeries (Bovas, Modern, Mike's). You are close to the Boston Public Market, the Aquarium, Fanieul Hall, Quincy Market, most of the Freedom Trail etc.. Highly recommend the \"\"duck\"\" city and harbour tour. We were happy to experience the Red Sox at Fenway Park and the Celtics in a Play off game at TD Gardens. The apartment is a walk up of 5 flights of stairs"
2842124,71874756,2016-04-29,63116242,Heather,"The location really can't be beat, and the neighborhood is charming. You'll get your exercise with the stairs up to the apartment, which is small but cozy and clean. There aren't a whole lot of amenities, so you may want to bring along things like Kleenex and washcloths. If you stay here you'll be surrounded by amazing places to eat and be within walking distance from a lot of places of historic interest."
2842124,73234050,2016-05-07,54856401,Teresa,"Peter was really nice and always available! :) his apt was clean and in really good conditions, moreover the position is great,  just few minutes walk from the earth of North End. My family and I really enjoyed it!"
2842124,73982586,2016-05-12,45347119,Corinna,Great location. Peter is a great host and the apartment is generally well maintained. There are four flights of stairs if you are not into that sort of thing. Walking distance from everything!
2842124,74977534,2016-05-17,19308053,Anna,"Peters apartment was ideally located, close to restaurants, cafes and a short walk to the bars in town. The closest T station is within a 2-3 minute walk. There were three of us in the apartment, it would be better suited to two people as the couch bed is a bit small for an adult. This is however the only minor complaint I would have about the property. Peter was away during our stay but had messages me prior to our arrival to inform me of where to pick up the keys. I would recommend this property for anyone considering a stay in Boston and would definitely use it on any future trips I may undertake."
2842124,75957371,2016-05-23,33821969,Jono,This apartment is in a Great location! So easy to get around the city from here. Place had everything we needed. Pete was away but made arrangements for us to get the keys and get in which was appreciated. Like others have said it is up a few flights of stairs which meant a few trips to get all the suitcases up! I popped up on the roof and there is just the best view of the Boston skyline
2842124,80020732,2016-06-15,59177928,Rosemary,"We did not meet host, we picked up keys from a laundrette, location was fantasic.  Overall we enjoyed our stay."
2842124,83032201,2016-06-30,10674504,Rachel,"We love the North End. Delicious food from bakeries to markets to restaurants. We walked daily in the neighborhood as well as through the city, the BostonCommon & into Newbury Street. Lovely little apartment with a great view. I even liked the walk up the 4 flights of stairs to get to our apartment because it was good exercise. The place was simple, clean & quiet."
2842124,92456157,2016-08-08,2082610,Sophie,J'ai contacté Peter dés notre arrivée pour savoir s'il y avait du wifi et malheureusement la réponse est arrivée le jour de notre départ !!!
2842124,98563090,2016-08-31,64215549,Maria,"I booked my trip to Boston 6 months ago through Airbnb for this location owned by Peter because of the supposedly good reviews for this location and that it was a clean place.  Arrived at this location on the 16th of August 2016.  Immediately, I was appalled at the condition of the residence, supposedly it having been cleaned before my arrival.  I CALLED Airbnb immediately and informed them of the problems with the address and they stated that they would open a case on these issues.  The following problems were noted and pictures were sent to Airbnb and are listed below:"
1. Dirty garbage under the sink,that I had to carry down 7 flights of stairs to be rid of,,,,
2. Moldy fruit and old and used condiments left in the refrigerator,,,,,
3. Toilet handle broken the first time I used the toilet,,,,,
4. Bathroom mat was dirty and molded,,,,,
5. The bathtub and sink would not drain,totally clogged,,,,
6. Stained and soiled sheets,pillows,and mattress,,,
7. Was supposed to have Wi-Fi capability when I had booked this location.  Peter gave me a password but it did not allow me to have access,,,,,
8. Only able to receive one channel on the TV,,,,,
9. Rug in the bedroom was very dirty,,,,,
I called the owner and he stated that he was out of town but would come over and address my issues on Thursday,the 18th of August.  In the meantime Peter advised me to call his plumber,which I did,and he arrived the next day and fixed the problems.  Peter arrived on Thursday in the evening and I and my brother met with him.  As I addressed each problem his demeanor and attitude was very dismissive.  He stated that because of the location people stay at this address just because it is in the North End of Boston.  Apparently,in his view,all these were minor problems and the cleanness has not been an issue.  I spent a whole day cleaning the place.  Peter did refund the cleaning fee via a check.
To make my stay more comfortable and not wanting to sleep on dirty linens,my brother brought over clean linens,pillows and a new bath mat.,,,

3342094,15853556,2014-07-16,10300493,Matthew,Catherine was great and super-communicative - this was my second stay with her and she made everything easy. The apartment itself is very spacious - it looks a lot larger than it does in the photos! Thanks for letting me use the bike - I'll definitely stay again!
3342094,16383659,2014-07-26,6543073,Justin,"Catherine was a great host and the apartment is incredible! The apartment is very spacious and has a large kitchen, a spacious master bed and a very comfortable 2nd bedroom. Its a very classy accommodation and is well maintained.  It also has an amazing grand piano that is over 100 years old, which Catherine graciously allows guests to use. This was a real treat for me as a musician. The building is also very classic Boston style architecture which really makes you feel part of the city."
Catherine was an extremely responsive host as well. My wife her mother and boyfriend and I made inquiries the day of travel to Boston and Catherine was quickly responsive and very accommodating,especially under short notice and with our late arrival.,,,,
And on an additional note,she does have a boa constrictor named Yggy. This might turn some away but Yggy is very low impact,is enclosed in a secure terrarium that is in a separate room. It is something that might make one reluctant but she is very unobtrusive and more importantly very docile and  rather interesting to watch.,,,
"I have nothing but positive words for our stay in a great apartment with a great and very communicative and accommodating host. I hope to be back! \"",,,,,

Phyllis made sure that we would find everything and that our trip to her place would be safe a few days before we arrived. Even though she was not in the country, she checked on us and asked to know whether we found everything at our convenience. It was lovely from her, but not necessary because everything was perfect."
We really enjoyed living 3 days in her place,it is charming,with a lot of personality.  This experience is really worth it and our regret is that we didn't get to meet Phyllis in person.,,,
The area is quiet,safe,pleasant and easy reachable in subway. It's a place very convenient to visit Boston. The house is close to the center of the city,15 minutes of subway on the orange line from Chinatown,and 5 minutes walking from Forest Hill stop to Phyllis' place.,
Thank you Phyllis,,,,,

However, in it's current state the target market for this room/place is the budget traveller, based on cleanliness and comforts. I knew this prior to booking, so I go what I expected. That said, it's probably a little pricey for a mattress on the floor. Lior's flatmate and friends were lovely, and respected my privacy, but were also happy to speak when we were around at the same time."
6955911,96996990,2016-08-25,57865182,Darcy,Awesome house and host - the most perfect place I could have possibly stayed in Boston leading up to entering Berklee.
6955911,97026253,2016-08-25,36727336,Thomas,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.

5882411,30263646,2015-04-19,13827533,Marten,"A great place to stay. First of all, it's not that far away from downtown Boston as it looks, since he metro station is literally only minutes away. The room and the house are very clean. The hosts are very nice - we arrived very late at night when they were already sleeping but they made sure we got the keys and felt welcome. Highly recommended."

5882411,31278842,2015-05-03,31462312,Laurent,"The keys were not at the indicated place by the owner so we had to sleep in our car the first night. There was only tea or coffee for breakfast, nothing else to eat. It's too bad because the host is friendly."
5882411,31563884,2015-05-06,32613424,Diana,These guys were great! My aunt and I needed a place last minute and they were able to accommodate us. We heard back from them right away and they were very friendly and welcoming. Would definitely look to stay with them in the future.
5882411,31859772,2015-05-10,14127060,Jacques,"The place was super clean, and the neighborhood was safe. Brian and Derian are nice hosts. I greatly recommend that place for your next stay in Boston. And it is a few steps from the subway station. You won't find anything better in Boston."

5882411,32392333,2015-05-17,18199629,Aurore,It's was a very nice experience.
Perfect appartement,very clean and confortable.,,,,
Near the metro station,in a beautiful street  who looks like San Franscico !,,,,
"Interesting discussion with Derian and Brian. All was perfect  !\"",,,,,
5882411,32548201,2015-05-19,5244528,Raissa,"We had a very comfortable stay at Derian and Brian's. The place is very clean, inviting, and quiet. We were not in the residence much but appreciated having a place to come home to. The room fit two people comfortably and the bed has a nice mattress. If you will be using public transportation, this place is great. You are literally a block away from the metro (don't worry you won't hear the trains). We unfortunately had a car and parking in the area is a bit tight."
5882411,33158336,2015-05-25,32874950,Maria,Derian and Brian were very hospitable and gave us valuable information about the neighborhood and how to get to Boston downtown.  The neighborhood is convenient and historically interesting.  The Forest Hills Cemetery down the block from their house is a magically restful place to spend some down time.
5882411,33718760,2015-05-31,6062357,Donna,If you are looking for a reasonable place to stay in Boston and want to feel comfortable - this is your place. I told Derian and Brian the first night I got there that I felt as though I was visiting friends that I had just met.
They made access to the house simple and even provided a Charlie Card (a train pass) for those that may need public transportation. The condo was bright,comfortable and well maintained (I even witnessed a cleaning frenzy one night). The room itself was clean,cozy and adequate for my purposes. For a condo in JP the bathroom is GINORMOUS! And that they have a ceiling fan in there AND keep plants in the shower really set it off (in a good way).,,,
The neighborhood is fabulous (although,I am a little biased considering I owned a condo there for 9 years). Parking,as with any densely populated area,can be a little tricky but not difficult. The train is right there and gives you easy access to downtown. There are a few restaurants in the area that are delicious (Dogwood,in particular) and give you an idea of the local charm of JP.,
And,of course,it would be tragic if i did not mention Chester - their spunky little pooch! His personality is so much bigger than his physical size. This dog made me smile and laugh and was just a little charmer. Love him!,,,
A great experience and when I'm back in town needing accommodations,"I will see if the room is available.\"",,,,
5882411,33974002,2015-06-02,34612694,Madeleine,We enjoyed a comfortable stay at Derian & Brian's. Their place was easy to find and provided us with a central location to stay during our short city visit. Thank you again :)
5882411,34031036,2015-06-03,3504671,Lauren,"Derian & Brian offer a nice room if you need a place to stay near Boston. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room and bathroom were very clean. We enjoyed the colorful rooms in their home! Our stay was brief (only 1 night), but Derian was friendly and helpful. The dog is friendly and the neighborhood is pretty quiet. There is an entrance to Forest Hills park at the end of their block. We also enjoyed a meal at the Dogwood Cafe at the other end of the street. Derian and Brian offer an option to drop off your luggage before the 4pm check-in time if you arrive before they have your room ready."
FYI to travelers in need of parking -- street parking between 8am-6pm is very limited in front of the house. If you need to park your car more than 2 hours,you will need to find another street for parking your car. Many streets in Jamaica Plain (and other Boston neighborhoods) are open only to cars with resident stickers. There are some 2-hour spaces open to non-residents at the end of the block,"but they are limited. \"",,,

Our time there was great and they provided service that my wife and I really appreciated: there for you when you wanted something,and out of your hair when you wanted privacy.,,,,
We were able to talk to them for long periods of time and ask questions about Boston neighborhoods,restaurants and shops. But my wife and I were also able to sit in the common areas and have private moments to ourselves as well.,,,,
The room was clean and had all the amenities we'd need to feel comfortable. The bathroom was spacious,and the common areas were inviting. The back porch was a great place to unwind in the afternoon.,,,,

The room is very cozy, the location very close to the T, and it only takes about 15-20 min to get downtown (depending on where you are going). The room was really quiet and so were so the hosts and other guests. Would definitely stay here again! Thanks for making my stay in Boston a great time! (P.s.: Chester is adorable!)"

The hosts were great:  Brian helped me with a mixup about the key, and Derian welcomed me and made sure I had everything I needed.  The room is just as pictured with the shared bathroom right next door.  They even provided a Charlie Card for the T which allows the user to get discounted fares - a nice bonus!  I look forward to staying there again."

We look forward to staying again during our next Boston adventure!

The room is very comfortable, has fast WiFi and great air conditioning for hot days.

The house was a quick walk to the train, and the Charlie card they provide made the experience even more convenient. Derian also made a great recommendation for a Vietnamese restaurant.

Derian was very friendly and made sure I felt at home and comfortable at all times. The rooms are exactly as you see them on the pictures, and the rest of the apartment looks like it was taken from an interior design magazine! The house is a 2 minute walk from Forest Hills station so access to public transportation is extremely easy. The orange line runs often and fast so getting around the city is not a problem, it shouldn't take much longer than around 25 minutes to get to downtown."

5882411,59625030,2016-01-12,48490055,Tammam,Great host. Clean room and house.
"Would stay again!\"",,,,,
5882411,60643047,2016-01-25,53465593,Melvin,"We definitely enjoyed our stay. But be aware that it is pretty cold in the house during the winter months, so remember to wear socks around. Definitely recommend!"
5882411,60942165,2016-01-29,46024609,Joseph,Second stay...everything was great!
5882411,61143709,2016-01-31,55795522,Elizabeth,Darian was a great host. His place was clean and comfortable. I would book again.
5882411,62263680,2016-02-13,34029051,Patrick,"My wife and I enjoyed our two-week stay at the Forest Treasure of the Fire Dragon while contractors were working on our nearby apartment. We would recommend staying at Derian's to anyone. The room and rest of the condo was exactly as described. The bedroom was cozy, but there was plenty of common space to relax."
Derian is an excellent host and responded promptly to any questions we had. We actually saw very little of him,as he respectfully gave us our privacy. Interactions with other guests were positive (when they were around).,,,,
Amenities provided include Netflix/Hulu (we don't watch much TV,so no cable was not an issue except we had to wait an extra day for The Bachelor to air),a supplemental heater and white noise machine in the bedroom,a nicely stocked kitchen (which we used almost daily),toiletries,fresh towels
Overall,it was a very good experience and if you need a room for a night or many,"consider staying here!\"",,,
5882411,63532138,2016-02-23,23036288,Gülin,I really loved this room! Derian was super accommodating and checkin was perfectly easy.
5882411,64724017,2016-03-06,61099322,Gus,Our stay at Derian's was great. The location is very convenient and the place itself is immaculate and comfortable. I would highly recommend it.
5882411,65466582,2016-03-13,7838065,Gwen,"A perfect Airbnb experience. The apartment is easy to find, beautifully decorated, and comfortable & quiet. While I didn't meet with the host in person, the house manual told me everything I needed to know. It was wonderful to be able to make a cup of tea, enjoy a hot shower, and get a good night's sleep. I also took a walk to the zoo thru the lovely Franklin Park cemetery at the top of the the street. A great place to stay!"
5882411,65760511,2016-03-16,51343202,Jon,Derian is an exceptional host. His place is just as described if not better. Is it very clean as is the room. He has a manual set up for anything you need. He is very friendly but not overbearing. He goes out of his way to make your stay better. He is available at any time for any questions or concerns. I would stay here again through AirBNB. I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed.
5882411,66050228,2016-03-19,56724778,Jocelyn,"Derian's home was lovely and quiet, and so close to the T stop. Very easy to get into the city! I didn't get to meet Derian in person but the house manual made everything simple, from getting the keys to resetting the breaker box. I would stay here again in the future!"
5882411,68138676,2016-04-02,60296512,Francis,"Derian is very friendly and accommodating, and his place is gorgeous. This is the first time I've seen real vines trained over railings indoors and I was suitably impressed."
The location is a bit far from the urban center (30 minutes to Back Bay),but I was actually here for the PROSE treatment at Boston Foundation for Sight. Situated between Boston proper and Needham Height,it was the ideal location for me,"and I would recommend this listing to any other PROSE patients.\"",,
5882411,68565529,2016-04-05,14098636,Afi,Derian made sure we had everything promised in his listing and we really enjoyed our stay!
5882411,69292768,2016-04-10,63874945,James,"Derian is a wonderful host. He had the room ready on time and it is exactly as described. He was a wonderful source of information for the neighborhood (good places to eat, best way to get to the location I needed to go, etc). This was my first experience with AirBNB and it is sure not to be my last. The neighborhood is excellent, half a block from the T stop (and bus hub)."
5882411,70657474,2016-04-19,9208866,Frank,"Everything was fine. The room was very cosy, clean and Derian was a great host. I can definitely recommend this place to other guests."

5882411,71955645,2016-04-30,27619508,Minkey,"Derian was quick to respond when I inquired about how close his place was to the T.  Low and behold, it was extremely close to the Forest Hills stop on the Orange Line, true to his word.  The booking was easy, the place was very nice and tidy.  We met another couple staying in another room, which was great and fun!  We ate/drank a bit near the shops just outside the T stop and enjoyed the new breakfast shop a lot.  We ran into Derian the next morning as we grabbed our bags on our way out for the day and he was as nice in person as he was through online communication.  It was a great stay for my girlfriend and I and recommend Derian to host your short or long stay in Boston."
5882411,72342525,2016-05-02,23059927,Kahlia,"We had a great stay at Derian's place. The house was very close to the metro station, room was comfortable and bathroom and kitchen had everything we needed and were clean. Definitely recommend staying here."
5882411,72538116,2016-05-03,482696,Ilenia,Derian è stato molto disponibile ad accoglierci anche a tarda sera. La casa è molto bella e luminosa in una zona tranquilla.

5882411,73775194,2016-05-10,5580864,Nicolas,"Derian was very kind with us!  The appartment is amazing, really beautifull and comfortable. We cooked, watch a movie and had an excelent time. The location is very good too, since the station is just two blocks away. We loved it!!! And we also meet some very nice people next door that were really nice"
5882411,74820657,2016-05-16,54359985,Emily,"Derian was a great host and helped us have an awesome stay in Boston. His directions were clear and the house was beautiful, clean, comfortable, and organized. My favorite part of the stay was having a quiet evening eating dinner on the balcony, which is surrounded by greenery in all directions. Beautiful house, neighborhood, and city!"
5882411,75028983,2016-05-18,20628449,Emily,"Was only there for a night, but the room was bright and extremely comfortable. The bathroom had everything we needed and the listing was neat and tidy"
5882411,76044050,2016-05-24,65409253,Primi,The room was very confortable and it had a beautiful bathroom. Lots of shampoo and conditioner options.  Closer to the Metro Station than expected. I only met the owner once but we didnt had any problem.
"Very clean house and quiet neighborhood. \"",,,,,
5882411,76673299,2016-05-28,40209310,Andrea,The room and stay was excellent! Everything was well organized and layer out in the house manual. I would highly recommend this to anyone!
5882411,77512875,2016-06-01,8269310,Debora,"My husband and I had a great first visit to Boston staying with Derian. His place was very comfortable and super tidy. The location, less than a block from the T, was completely perfect. We loved his back porch among the trees and appreciated Derian's attention to detail."
5882411,78365710,2016-06-06,53355989,Ludy,I traveled to Boston for my sisters' wedding. She also lives in the JP district within walking distance from Derians' place. The street was very quiet and the house is beautifully decorated. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom very clean always. We had many events in the area so we were barely there during our four day stay. There is a cafe and a train station within walking distant making this home an ideal location. I thought staying in a strangers house would be uncomfortable but he made us feel very welcomed and right at home. We will definitely stay here again. Great experience!
5882411,78684493,2016-06-08,3184486,Harriet,"We were entirely satisfied with this experience. Derian's listing in airbnb was the most creative and appealing one that we had seen, and still his fees were very modest. Though the room was not big, it included a chest of drawers and a desk and chair and an air conditioner, and a small closet. The bed was comfortable. The home was lovingly and creatively decorated with beautiful colored walls, carefully chosen arts and crafts on the walls. The living room and kitchen were welcoming, and we had a pleasant encounter with the other people staying in the apartment."
5882411,80290889,2016-06-17,9013683,Esteban,"La casa es super cómoda limpia y ordenada, es mejor que las fotos, esta muy bien ubicada. Derian es estructurado y metículoso, Todo esta en su perfecto orden y lugar. Recomiendo este alojamiento 100%"
5882411,80988795,2016-06-20,15983434,Danny,I absolutely enjoyed my stay! The place is really comfortable and convenient and we got to do our laundry too which is a huge plus!
5882411,81574531,2016-06-23,26669496,Autumn,"Derian's vibrant home in Boston's Jamaica Plains neighborhood was comfortable and convenient. It's just a  hop and a skip to the metro station, and there are several great restaurants nearby. Plus, the huge cemetery at the end of the block is one of the most beautiful spots in the entire city. Derian made check in and out as well as the entire stay fluid and enjoyable through his planning and order. Gorgeous, artistic home."
5882411,82192298,2016-06-26,65118333,Siara,"Derian was a great host. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I didn't get to see much of him, but that was perfectly fine. It was our first Airbnb experience and certainly won't be our last."
The place is a super chill,mellow,funky space. It's well kept and very clean. Derian is a great host and I would recommend staying here. Parking during the weekdays during the day time can be a pain,but at least it was nice out when we were there. This doesn't reflect Derian's place,but driving in Boston can be frustrating. I would recommend public transportion and Uber.,
Overall,"great trip and I would book again! \"",,,,
5882411,82988168,2016-06-30,47513610,Cecilia,"This is the second time I stayed at Derian's. Again everything was perfect. The place is clean, well located, and comfortable. I'd definitely recommend it! Thanks a lot Derian :D"

5882411,84314694,2016-07-06,56739879,Christo,"Derian's home is very well located, about 5 minutes walk from a Metro stop. It is located in a tree lined residential street."
The house was well equiped and the room had more than enough space for two people and their luggage. Access to a washer and dryer is a big bonus.,,,,,
Derian was friendly,"provided clear instructions and made us feel at home.\"",,,,
5882411,85244004,2016-07-10,65763239,Samantha,"Derian's AirBNB was extremely pleasant for a 4 night stay visiting Boston. The home is beautiful, clean, welcoming and very comfy. It's right next to the Forest Hill stop on the Orange line and easy to find. Boston was our old home that we were coming back to visit. Having a cozy and calming headquarters does wonders for the quality of the trip. Thanks!"
5882411,85666443,2016-07-12,17205776,Jess,"such a helpful, kind host. great house. sweet neighborhood right by public tranportation. loved it!"
5882411,86376957,2016-07-16,82172624,David,Derian waited up for my late arrival and made sure all was ok before he went to bed.
Everything was exactly or described so there were no disappointments. I had everything I needed during my stay and everywhere was clean and tidy.,,,,,
It's an easy walk of only a few minutes to Forest Hills T-station and 20 mins from there direct to the heart of Back Bay,a few blocks from Copley Sq. / Prudential Center.,,,,
Derian very friendly but not pushy and extremely helpful.,,,,,

5882411,88149195,2016-07-23,80144469,Chris,Super Clean.  Just half a block from the train station.   Derian made us feel right at home.   Can't go wrong.

5882411,89255480,2016-07-27,16632693,Sierra,"I returned on my next trip to Boston because the experience was so pleasant!  Clean, crisp, fresh, fragrance free linens, fantastic shampoo and soap options, and everything organized well. Instructions to enter and find my room were perfect.  And SO close to the T, yet the short walk is very pleasant and the neighborhood quiet."
5882411,89960143,2016-07-30,35390007,Anke,Derian is a very helpful and nice host. Everything was clean and the bed very comfy. The neighbourhood is safe and it is very close to the T.

5882411,94671285,2016-08-16,33678770,Nabi,Derian was a good host and friendly. there were enough dishes to use and everything were well thought of just like a hotel. we enjoyed our stay there.
5882411,95471688,2016-08-19,85735255,Emily,Did not get to meet Derian in person because we arrived late but he continually checked in on us via text messaging which was very hospitable . The apartment was very nice and spacious and the bathroom is big and includes nice grooming products. The neighborhood was very quite and extremely close to the forest hill subway line which I loved. Around the area is restaurants and bars and a nice coffee shop that serves pastries and sandwiches.  The place is also walking distance from the co-op which is convenient especially since you can do your own cooking at the house. I would certainly recommend this apartment to businessmen looking to commute into Boston or for anyone looking to explore the city without having to pay downtown room prices.
7050397,37522910,2015-07-07,17037644,Senthil,"The Apartment was as described, and was well maintained. The stay was very pleasant and comfortable. Jaclyn was amazing and was one f the best hosts I have seen."

82637,1757796,2012-07-20,2402556,Chris,"My son, on crutches, and I needed to be in Boston for a week - work for me and looking for work and networking for him. We were able to book a stay at the Bunker Hill B&B at the last minute. Christiane was an excellent hostess; the Nautical Room compact, yet completely adequate for our needs. It was quite easy to get in and out of downtown using the bus system."
82637,8266612,2013-10-22,9356608,Athith,"Very nice, clean room that was well located. Christiane was a very friendly and attentive host. She gave us very good dinner ideas and had tips for plenty of activities."
82637,16795364,2014-08-02,17959326,Melissa,The bed was comfortable and the location was great. The room was also surprisingly very quiet. The room needed a good dusting and the bathroom was not the cleanest but the host had just had eye surgery the day before we arrived as well as car and computer drama so it might not have been her best week. The linens were clean and the breakfast well-presented.
82637,20045142,2014-09-22,20902126,Jeremy,"Christiane was accommodating, helpful and chatty. I was working so it was difficult to make the strict 830 breakfast slot, but Christiane did her best to accommodate. As a Boston representative Christiane was very knowledgable and helpful, particularly with regards to the museums. Lastly, the room itself was large and nicely decorated, the bed was fantastically comfortable, and the shower and bathroom were great. Would recommend."
82637,32541190,2015-05-19,23491946,John,"Centrally located in the charming community of Charlestown, a few minutes from our son’s apartment, the Nautical Room was a good choice for us.  Christiane is a delightful host who is proud of her Boston background, very knowable about the city and always ready to help you with advice, museum tickets, etc.   As you would expect with a home built in the 1800’s, the rooms are small, but certainly serviceable, and decorated with an interesting collection of antiques and other memorabilia.   Our king size bed was quite comfortable, and while the bathroom is small, the instant heater and rain shower head are wonderful.   A good value for staying in the Boston area."
82637,35409545,2015-06-18,34000508,Robin,"Our hostess was so sweet it was like staying with my mom, wanting to know about our day ,"
82637,38236100,2015-07-13,37908051,Syed,"Christiane was a very friendly host. The room had everything I needed and was a pleasant place to spend the weekend. The neighborhood is nice and offers a quiet contrast to downtown Boston, which is just a short trip away."
82637,39563499,2015-07-24,3766870,Rick,"Had a great stay at Christianes place! It was very convenient to everything in Charlestown, and the Bunker Hill monument was on the way in to the office so a 294 step workout with a view was always available. Make sure and try the meatball sub from Jenny's Pizza which is just around the corner."
82637,41154306,2015-08-04,29622678,Dennis,"A delightful stay in a wonderful old home and a great neighborhood that is a short walk to coffee shops, Whole Foods, and more. Christiane is extremely attentive and very helpful. We plan to stay again on future visits to Boston."

82637,47513490,2015-09-19,42692678,Jean,My stay was comfortable.  Christiane was attentive and accommodating. I was required to do a nightshirt and I didn't feel I was imposing.  I would stay here again.
82637,50685894,2015-10-13,7920775,Wilson,"Christiane was a wonderful and warm and nicest host. She was very concern for us and was very nice and make sure if we needed any other information, and offered guidance regarding the city of Boston, all the available guides and brochures were handy at her place. Christiane seem like she has experienced on hotel management. The listing regarding her AirBNB was accurate. The neighborhood was great and there was public transportation which took you to downtown Boston less than 30 minutes ride. It is possible to walk directly to Boston downtown if you are a fast walker."
82637,87699520,2016-07-21,83959996,Ellee,"I so enjoyed staying with Christiane.  Eclectic, vintage, and whimsical...  I felt at home...  Thank you!"

Everything was included in the house (shampoo, coffee etc). I definitely recommend the place and I would definitely go back in case I'll get back to Boston. It was a very nice experience and I appreciate the fast reply and good communication from Liz."
4457943,25903137,2015-01-29,14344099,Richard,"\"This was by far the best experience I have had with a property. The space was absolutely perfect. Location was incredible- close to the city and the heart of JP. Dale and Liz were INCREDIBLE. They were flexible with our arrival and departure. They made the booking process VERY simple. We were in town during the \"\"Blizzard of 2015"
4457943,27774104,2015-03-11,14344099,Richard,Another great experience! The space is incredible. Very clean. Very easy to work with. Great location. We will defiantly be back!
4457943,28251630,2015-03-21,5124744,Kathleen,Excellent accommodation in a great location! The apartment is larger than it looks in photos - with all the amenities you could need and very comfortable beds. It is a short walk to the T station with easy access all over town. The JP neighborhood itself is fun to explore and our lovely hosts gave us great suggestions for local places to check out.  I would definitely recommend this place to others!!
4457943,28627968,2015-03-27,5792570,Magda,"This was a GREAT experience. I needed to book a two-bedroom for a couple of days for clients coming in for a fundraiser at my company. Once booked, Dale and Liz were constantly in communication with me, they answered urgent questions immediately, were friendly, etc."
The clients were thrilled with the space,which was convenient to the subway and in a really sweet area of Jamaica Plain,"Boston. Would definitely book this place again.\"",,,

4457943,33588529,2015-05-30,24693673,Carol,"We totally enjoyed our stay at the Brickhouse. It wax an easy ride into downtown Boston (8 minutes), and so nice to come back to peace and quiet at night.  The apartment was beautifully decorated and fully stocked for all one needs. Dale was there to meet us and gave us a lot of tips on nearby places to eat. Will surely go back to Boston, and will SURELY stay in the Brickhouse.  Lovely place, great hosts!"
4457943,34521059,2015-06-09,14686255,Russel,"The Brickhouse was great, and Liz and Dale were wonderful hosts! They allowed us to drop our bags off early so we did not have to lug them around the neighborhood waiting for check-in. That was much appreciated! They gave us a tour of the property and explained everything we needed to know about the house, neighborhood, train, etc."
The house was fantastic. Nicely decorated,cozy,and well-appointed. The beds were amazing,and we slept exceptionally well. There were plenty of towels and other toiletries in the closet,which was great.,
We really enjoyed JP,and loved how close we were to two T stations. It made getting around the city so easy. Their blog was also super helpful throughout the weekend,as it's filled with food recommendations and other info.,,,
Our only issue was with Alex,the Uber driver that they recommended. He agreed to take us to the airport at 5 am,but when I hadn't heard from him by 5:20 am,I called and he said he had car trouble and couldn't make it. Stuff happens,but a heads up would have been nice. We had to scramble and find another driver,which left us dangerously close to not making our flight. I am willing to bet that he would never have contacted us
That is honestly the only negative we can think of,and again,"it was not the fault of our hosts. We loved our stay and hope to make it back in the future. \"",,,
4457943,38830052,2015-07-19,13427153,Karin,"Eine sehr schöne und gemütliche Unterkunft mit kurzer Distanz durch einen Park zur U-Bahn. Dale und Liz waren sehr angenehme Gastgeber, die mit vielen Details dafür gesorgt haben, dass wir uns in ihrer Wohnung wie Zuhause fühlten."
4457943,41350834,2015-08-07,34308470,Nate,"Dale and Liz have a most excellent place in Jamaica Plain.  You cannot go wrong staying here.  The apartment is in a quiet area, we rarely heard anything fro the streets or from the neighbor.  The area itself is interesting, plenty of artists, restaurants, and a block from the Sam Adams Brewery.  You are also just a couple blocks from the orange T subway line, which was a huge selling point for us.  The apartment is full of nice little touches.  Lights that come on automatically, locks that don't require keys, and an extremely comfortable couch to relax on. It's obvious they care about the place.  They have a little website set up with local things to do and places to eat if you need.  It also includes instructions for entry, finding the place, and anything else one would need.  Bottom line, if I have friends going to Boston, I'm telling them to not monkey around with a hotel, I'm telling them to stay here if at all possible."
4457943,41935275,2015-08-10,9398308,Joris,"The place is all that it is advertised to be, well equipped, comfortable and clean. Short distance from metro to the center, 2 blocks from the Sam Adams brewery, and some nice places to have drink/eat."
Good and clear directions and easy to use the code to get in. Having the baby bed and toys there saved us from having to bring them with us. Overall very good experience.,,,,,

4457943,44096230,2015-08-24,28643616,Belinda,"Great new apartment with loads of space, really well equipped (including the huge TV - much appreciated by the kids!) in a quiet spot. We really liked the leafy area, and it was only 5 mins to the metro and a short journey into the city centre."
"Dale and Liz were very helpful with all requests before and during our stay.\"",,,,,
4457943,47252327,2015-09-17,37501745,Marie,"We loved our stay at The Brickhouse! It's in a lovely neighbourhood, easy access to the T; roughly 15 minutes into the city centre. The house was well equipped with everything you could possibly need, including coffee, tea and other store cupboard ingredients. There was even a large array of shampoos, shower gels etc. The house was spotlessly clean and very comfortable. We'd definitely stay again if we're back in Boston!"
4457943,48270442,2015-09-25,28592638,Susan,Excellent location and wonderful hosts.  All your home away from home needs.  Very clean and comfortable.  Dale and Liz are more than helpful.  Would stay again and recommend to others.
4457943,48542023,2015-09-27,40823777,Amy,"Thanks for your hospitality!  Your home is great and very comfortable.  Your roof is a little scary - I'm so glad Dale told us about the noises it can make, however, I forgot to tell my other friends and they really did think something was going on!  It was fun!!"
4457943,49313712,2015-10-03,6990655,Linda,We were Very welcomed by Dale when we were there.  Everything was very clean and contemporary.  We loved making this our home while in Boston.  It was close to public transportation-easy to get to from the airport.  We easily found street parking but took the train into downtown.  We would stay here again!  Thanks for sharing your place with us.
4457943,50321046,2015-10-11,43720577,Véronique,"Great place, clean and comfy! Dale and Liz were very helpful and kind. We had an amazing time in Boston and would recommend this their place anytime!"
"Thank you so much :)\"",,,,,
4457943,53169134,2015-11-06,12841004,Milena,"L'esperienza presso la brick house di Dale e Liz è stata molto positiva. La casa era molto pulita, ordinata e corrispondeva alla descrizione fornita nell annuncio. La vicinanza di due fermate della metro è stata molto utile. Dale era presente sia al ns arrivo che la mattina seguente. Ci ha anche permesso di lasciare al piano terra della casa le valigie per poter visitare ancora un po' la città dopo il check-out. Un esperienza molto positiva che ci sentiamo di raccomandare a chi voglia visitare Boston."
4457943,55863720,2015-12-06,49117687,Cody,Nice place. As advertised. Decent location. About a $13 uber to downtown. Dale stopped by to make sure things were ok. I would stay there again.
4457943,56571505,2015-12-14,7185706,Hannah & Joe,"The Brick House is beautiful, comfortable, and complete with basic necessities. Liz and Dale were so accommodating and were there to greet us at the door. The Brick House is also close to MBTA(Boston train line). That's a huge plus if you rely heavily on public transportation. Would highly recommend this place to everyone!"
4457943,56970236,2015-12-20,40834984,Jiacheng,"This is a fantastic experience to live here. The house is cuzy,clean and fully equipped. I really enjoy the time living here."
4457943,61636496,2016-02-07,46807327,Richard,Great location and great space. Clean. Quiet. Well equipped.  Ample off street parking. Great for a party of 3-4. We'd come back.
4457943,64852686,2016-03-08,23882343,Frank,Great place in a great city had a awesome time! Would love to stay again. It was a fifteen minute walk to lots of bars and shops right next to the T also. Didnt need it this time was plenty to do around JP.
4457943,65097826,2016-03-10,23314529,Chen,"Liz and Dale are awesome, they give us thorough information prior our arriving, the parking is free and easy to find the space, the house is big enough for a group of friends or family. They have comfy bed and shower. I had a lot of experience on Airbnb, this one is the best you can got on such reasonable price! This Airbnb trip makes our Boston trip perfect. Highly recommend!"
4457943,66392946,2016-03-22,52395681,Brian,We stayed from12 March 2016 to the 21st.
We had a great time staying at Liz and Dales place. The house was just perfect,it had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. Very comfortable beds and great kitchen and living area. The location was also great with the T line just a short walk away to get into the centre of Boston and shops,bars and restaurants all within walking distance. Liz and Dale provided us with all the information we needed to make our stay fantastic. We would definitely recommend the brick house.,,,

4457943,70663805,2016-04-19,45555077,Brett,"We had a wonderful stay!  Was so convenient to public transportation into Boston.  Loved that we could walk to Ula Cafe for breakfast and Bella Luna at the Milky Way for dinner.  The place was comfortable, especially beds after the Boston marathon!  The owners were very welcoming and helpful with answering questions and providing suggestions.  We really like the Jamaica Plains area."
4457943,71215332,2016-04-24,11439763,Steffen,"The location was great with easy parking, the neighborhood was very nice with lots of places to eat and the subway nearby."
4457943,74322806,2016-05-14,45767513,Lizzeth,"My family stayed at Liz and Dale's during graduation week. Their place was lovely, well kept, and clean. They had toiletries and clean towels available for us. Their kitchen was well supplied and useful during my family's stay. The hosts were friendly and approachable.  The apartment is a close walk to the metro station and there is free/non-permit street parking."
4457943,75759975,2016-05-22,33155004,Dora,"I really enjoy staying in Liz and Dale apartment, their place is very pretty, clean, and comfortable. And their apartment is close to Subway and some good restaurant. As for Liz and Dale they are very good host, they are nice and patient. Very impressive experience staying here."
4457943,77355136,2016-05-31,3564566,Barbara,"Liz & Dale's AirBNB was one of best we have in among the many. We loved their 2 bedroom townhouse, very well furnished & in a great neighborhood. It was quiet & easy parking with restaurants & coffee minutes away. They were so available for any questions & when the weather suddenly became hot, they installed the 3 air conditioning units immediately. We highly recommend this home."
4457943,77591995,2016-06-02,10321541,Crystal,Exceeded my expectations! Such a nice place to stay and I will definitely recommend it to out of town guests! Loved the space and set-up. The room was nice - black out curtains too - and toiletries provided so I enjoyed an indulgent bath. It was perfect; only wish I stayed longer!
4457943,80750422,2016-06-19,19288374,Leslie,"Liz and Dale were extremely communicative from the very beginning, even before the booking-they answered questions promptly. Once the reservation was made, they provided lots of welcoming information and great directions about how to get to the location, as well as little details we might need during our stay. I really appreciated their offers to answer any questions we might have."
The space was clean,spacious,cozy,quiet,comfortable,convenient-all the qualities one would want for a Boston stay! We were able to use the kitchen
4457943,83441672,2016-07-03,18470285,Charlene,The hosts were very welcoming. They checked in with us after a day to make sure everything was fine. The room was exactly as advertised and very clean. We had everything we needed. J/P is a very eclectic neighborhood with some great restaurants. If you want to be close to downtown and in the heart of Boston this may not be the place for you.  But if you want to see a neighborhood and commute by transit in for 20-30 minutes then this is the place!
4457943,86653084,2016-07-17,28851589,Meritxell,Mi estancia con Liz y Dale fue muy agradable. Me alojé junto con mi pareja y apenas vimos a Liz y Dale ya que trabajamos la mayor parte del dia. El uso de cerraduras con codigos hizo muy fácil el llegar e irnos a cualquier hora. Toda la casa está recién renovada y todo está muy limpio y es muy bonito. Fueron muy atentos y nos ayudaron en todo lo que les pedimos. Muchas gracias por todo!
4457943,87103513,2016-07-18,50947474,Jj,"Great communication from Liz and the unit was spotless when we walked in. The room was very comfortable and the bathroom, kitchen and living room were all awesome. Would definitely stay here again."
4457943,87790049,2016-07-21,36458667,Christiane,"Wir haben das erste Mal über Airbnb gebucht und waren total begeistert. Die Unterkunft ist wie beschrieben. Sehr sauber, man hatte im Badezimmer genug Platz und auch in den Schlafzimmern war genug Platz für die Koffer. Die Betten waren sauber und tolle Decken zum Zudecken. Von der Wohnung konnte man in 5 Minuten die Bahn erreichen. Man fühlte sich sicher in der Gegend. Ich würde immer wieder kommen und kann es nur empfehlen. LG Christiane"
4457943,90029148,2016-07-30,29916259,David,"This was my first ever trip to the USA. We only had three nights in Boston and hotel prices seemed so expensive. This was the first time I'd used Airbnb so I didn't know what to expect. The booking process was very straight forward and armed with lots of information we arrived at Hogan airport. It took a good hour to get through immigration and as it was late we took a taxi to the apartment. On arrival I punched the number into the lock and lo and behold a lovely well equipped apartment. The next day overwhelmed by jet lag we invested in a week pass on the T, the name for the metro and set about exploring Boston. The apartment is a short walk from two metro stations and only 20 minutes from downtown. Boston is very compact and very easy to explore. Initially we walked the Freedom Trail with the help of a guide book, which got us really orientated and gave us a good understanding of the history. We enjoyed a sunset boat tour, a guided visit to Harvard and a lovely walk around the harbour. That was enough before picking up our hire car at the airport and heading for New Hampshire. Everything was so easy and convenient."
4457943,90889128,2016-08-02,52461508,Carley,"This was a great place to stay. Easy to get downtown via the orange line. Liz and Dale were super easy to communicate with. If you're in Boston, stay here."
4457943,92445432,2016-08-08,57184739,Wayne,We had a great time in Boston and enjoyed this Airbnb experience.  Liz/Dale were more than accommodating - even allowed us to check-in a few hours earlier than expected.  Liz stopped by to say hi and to make sure that all was well and also checked in again a few days later to see if we needed anything.  Their townhouse was just as described - and was a fantastic place to come back to after long days exploring Boston.  I've stayed in hotel rooms that were 1/2 as nice for twice the price as we paid for this Airbnb!
4457943,92889786,2016-08-10,83766875,Diane,"Our hosts were fabulous, they did a wonderful job of accommodating us with our early arrival.    We were so close to the Sam Adams brewery tour, which we loved, and a wonderful little place to have a dinner or glass of beer out on the patio.   And the train was within walking distance.  The location was quite, clean and just as described.  Perfect Hosts,  thank you for making our visit to Boston so much more enjoyable!!!!!   Diane and Steve"
4457943,99472060,2016-09-05,3294777,Bettina,"I concur with every other positive comment! This is an immaculate, spacious, well-equipped space, Liz and Dale are completely professional hosts, it's priced fairly, and the neighborhood is wonderful. I plan to make it my first choice accommodation when I'm in Boston visiting my daughter at college (even though it's not near the school, it's entirely worth the bit of extra travel time)."
8792,13077,2009-10-11,33258,Cecil,"\"The unit was quiet, convenient, & excellently connected to the \"\"T\"\"... Walking the Freedom Trail & nearby Beacon Hill area was the highlight of our trip. The unit was very spacious and luminous"
"Well done.\"",,,,,
8792,14477,2009-10-21,41425,Tim,"We had a good time staying in Boston. Anne Sasser is a realestate manager who handles multiple places including longer stays. She therefore knows her business and is very flexible. The apartment was in a nice building on Beacon street, right next to the Mass State house; so very conveniently located, and clean enough, although the cutlery could have been a little cleaner. The appliances were all fine and laundry was easy enough. I would recommend this stay if you are out all day like we were. The rate is very reasonable and better than any hotel in that area, and there is a kitchen so you don't have to go out every night."
8792,15676,2009-10-31,41242,Tamas,Anne was a wonderful and very helpful host! The apartment is friendly and has an excellent location. We really enjoyed our stay there.
8792,15958,2009-11-02,33922,Nancy,Fantastic location! Comfortable unit! Anne couldn't have been a better host- went out of her way to accommodate us!
8792,21316,2009-12-24,63117,Jonathan T,"I am delighted to give everyone my full endorsement of Anne and her apartments.   She is cheerful, warm hearted and will fix anything.  For example, the TV was out of sync and she made it work.  The apartment was very clean. If you need a place to stay in Boston get in touch with Anne.  Jonathan, from Vermont"
8792,22540,2010-01-02,46623,Christina,The apartment on Beacon Street was just great. The updated kitchen was a pleasure to cook in and there were all sorts of kitchen accessories to make it feel like home. Anne was extremely attentive to us and a plesure to meet.  We will connect with her again to rent an apt. in Boston!
8792,7361017,2013-09-17,2262008,Adam,"Great condo! AMAZING rooftop deck (with killer views) which wasn't listed in the ad. Giant, comfy bed. Nice bathroom. Totally recommend booking it!"
8792,7620273,2013-09-27,7427248,Randi,"This was our first time with Airbnb and we are so pleased! Our apartment in Boston on Beacon Hill  was all we hoped for and more and Anne was so helpful. She worked with us on some scheduling issues for check in and out and we felt we were in good hands. The apartment was just right, so comfortable and in a perfect location for walking to all of Boston's main sights, or to hop on the T. While there is street noise the window fan helped mask that. It also was a very interesting old building and we felt very safe. would love to return tomorrow!"
8792,10660675,2014-03-02,11232045,Andrea,"The apartment is perfect for anyone who needs a furnished place to stay for either several days or several weeks.  I rented this place for one month so I got a good feel for the building and the unit.  The unit is very much as described, actually a bit nicer than the pictures do it justice.   The kitchen has much of what you need for simple cooking and a decent counter space to work with.  The bathroom is recently renovated. There is a bit of street noise but that was pretty much concentrated on Fri or Sat evenings, not during the week.  The heat can either be on or off, but that worked just fine to regulate the temperature."
The building is quite nice with a lovely lobby and nicely maintained common areas.  You feel very safe and it is generally very quiet,you are unlikely to even see many other residents.,,,,
The location is AMAZING for anyone wishing to be downtown to explore,tour,enjoy the great city of Boston.  A few minutes walk from Park St T stop,Beacon Hill,Back Bay,Financial District. You can see the Boston Common.
Anne was a fine host - responsive to inquiries during rental process,had the unit cleaned and organized for my arrival,"and was responsive to my questions during my stay.  \"",,,
8792,13545096,2014-05-30,7918820,Linda,"Anne is a very friendly and helpful host. She even did her best to send me back an item that I forgot at her apartment. The apartment is located at an excellent place and the view from the roof top is gorgeous. The apartment was very clean and had everything I needed. I was happily surprised about that, because some of the amenities present were not mentioned in her advertisement for the room. I recommend staying here."
8792,17214774,2014-08-09,17264085,Peggy,Anne was fantastic! Getting in to the unit was easy and she was there to explain the specifics.  The location is PERFECT! I would definitely stay here again when visiting Boston.  The room is very clean and nice and the comfortable furniture is great after walking all day. The bed is comfy too!
The restaurant next door is great,and there is a convenience store on the corner.  The view from the top deck is fantastic.,,,,

Very comfortable and an amazing location (really close to everything,the T included),,,,
"Anne was very helpful since the first day that I contacted her. \"",,,,,
8792,28999057,2015-04-02,21856931,Brian,"Our stay at the Beacon apartment was excellent! Anne was extremely helpful and the apartment is perfect for a single traveler or couple. The building is in a beautiful area adjacent to the state house and the Boston Commons, across the street from the Athenaeum, walking distance from many restaurants, and is a 5 - minute walk from the T. The apartment itself is very comfortable, with a new mattress on the bed and a good-sized living room. Would definitely stay here agin, very comfortable and convenient!"
8792,29837932,2015-04-13,4106395,Susan,"Easy to check in. Make sure to re-read the fine print on the complex's $100 move-in requirement - we would have forgotten to bring a check if Anne hadn't reminded us right before. The unit was out of TP, but Anne brought some for us the next day.  She was very accommodating on a late check-out - we left our luggage there before our night flight so we could still explore. I would love to see a guest book of maps and restaurant recommendations - there were a couple guidebooks, but they were a bit out of date. The location is perfect - perfect- perfect for sightseeing."
8792,30431527,2015-04-21,31365954,Kelly,"This was a great solution to finding a place to stay in Boston on Marathon weekend.  Beautiful building, central location and wonderful staff!  Anne was so great to work with.  Responsive, helpful and flexible.  Thinking of going back in September!"
8792,32108117,2015-05-14,11915520,John,Everything as advertised.  Great apartment and great location.  Would stay there again.
8792,33029347,2015-05-24,13563648,Alec,Anne was great. She responded quickly and helpfully when we wanted a last minute booking and had pre-booking questions. She met us at the apartment upon our arrival and helped provide area orientation directions. The apartment met all our needs and was as described ... and is a great location!
8792,43031836,2015-08-17,10180285,Charmian,I am very happy with Anne’s apartment- well-set bedrooms and ready for use kitchen with coffee and basic cooking ingredients. It feels really like home!
The location is perfect for me. I walked to see my children at Berklee college of Music along the beautiful Charles River. The Apt. is right across the Boston Common Park,and is a short walk to all shopping at the Financial district and China Town.,,,,
The security ans service of the building is also exceptionally great.,,,,,
Anne is always readily available for me with any questions I have.  I am very grateful.,,,,,

12856007,90497481,2016-08-01,59483688,Pallavi,"Raquel was very welcoming, and the apartment was cozy. The building itself is slightly old so the air conditioning was not very effective (there was also no thermostat in the apartment). We only spent the nights at the apartment and were out for most part of the day, so it was fine."
2014651,9263204,2013-12-16,10599535,Brendan,I live in JP and needed a room for a couple guests to stay after a party at my house. Molly was very accommodating.  She has a great home with a lot of JPish charm.
2014651,11080461,2014-03-19,12615184,Rebecca,"Molly's a cold fish, so don't expect a friendly chat. Fortunately, her husband Nik is gregarious, outgoing, and full of historical lore about the neighborhood's former brewery trade (he works for Harpoon beer himself), which gave rise to much of Jamaica Plain itself, with its sometimes vintage three-family porched houses and characterful hundred year-old watering hole/restaurant, Doyle's, right around the corner from Nik and Molly's."
Because Molly's father owns the building,the young couple scored a beautiful vintage apartment,whose centerpiece is the near-octagonal formal dining area with its massive and splendid china cabinet,double pillared entranceway,and simple square stained-glass window. The living room's unobstructed views of private gardens and Victorian homes are priceless. Despite the beauty of the dining area,however
2014651,11206901,2014-03-24,13284366,Siqi,"This was my first airbnb experience, and Molly was a great host! The location was also fantastic, less than 30 minutes away from downtown boston.  I had a great visit and would stay again on my next visit."
2014651,11704573,2014-04-12,13604059,Jessica,We were in a last minute situation when contacted Molly.  She replied us instantly and approved for our stay at her house.
We only stayed at Molly's place for less than 7 hours since we had an 5am flight to catch.  Molly was on a business trip so we only met her husband Nik.,,,,,
Molly's place is very spacious with some very cute furniture.  They live on the third floor of a house so if you have big luggages,it might be a challenge to lift them all up.  This place is a little aged but since we only need a bed for few hours,we didn't really pay much attention.,,,
We had a rental car during our trip and we were able to find a parking at 9PM on street across Molly's place.  This is a residential area,not much entertainment spots around.  It took us 20 minutes to the Logan Airport by driving,"not sure about public transportation.\"",,,
2014651,12513669,2014-05-04,10781918,Ghizlaine,We've spent 2 nights at Molly's and Nik's and had a wonderful time there ! They both have been the sweetest hosts and kindly waited for us even though our bus got stuck in the traffic and arrived more than an hour late !
The room is very nice and comfortable and Nik and Molly provided us with everything we needed,including towels,a map and even an umbrella !,,,
Their home is lovely and they both really took great care of us,even leaving what we needed for breakfast on the table :),,,,
What's more,we enjoyed Jamaica Plains,it's a really nice and lively place,with lots of restaurants and artist galleries,and it's only 15 minutes away from Boston (with the T line). Thanks to Nik's and Molly's advice,we ate in good restaurants and had the chance to taste the best ice-cream !
If you want to visit Boston and need a place where you can feel like home,"Molly's and Nik's is THE place :)\"",,,,
2014651,13586861,2014-05-31,15738894,Rachel,"So great! We'd highly recommend staying with Molly and Nik in JP. Lovely apartment, a super comfy bed, clean and convenient space. They are kind and generous people and even bought cheerios for breakfast when we found out we were bringing our 4  year old daughter! They made it easy for us to come and go during our stay there and were warm and welcoming. I highly recommend them!"
2014651,14005165,2014-06-09,2354240,Brian,Excellent experience with Nik and Molly!  Very kind and gracious from the moment we arrived in Boston.
2014651,14315312,2014-06-16,3837734,Cam,"Molly and Nik made sure to be home when we arrived, offered help with directions, and were flexible with check-out. We were only there for one night, but the room was clean and neat, the rest of the house was lovely, and breakfast and coffee were available. If you're on a budget and want to stay in a lovely neighborhood in Boston, this is a great choice."
2014651,15734025,2014-07-14,3991282,Olivier,"Molly was on vacation so her husband hosted us for 3 nights. The apartment was nice, Nik was also very welcoming. He made sure that our stay was going well and he gave us interesting informations about things to do in Boston and the restaurants in their neighborhood. We recommend their apartment without hesitation."
2014651,16944072,2014-08-04,10541356,Haseena,"We found Nik to be very pleasant, helpful on arrival and on call if needed. (Molly was on working vacation, so we did not get to meet her.)"
The directions to the house were very clear and easy to manage from the train. The surrounding area is quiet and peaceful. Yet,still in walking distance to the trains and shops to access food.,,,,
The house has character and the room is what we paid for. Comfortable bed,towels,closet for hanging clothes and has strong wifi.,,,
We were welcome to use all areas of the apartment and in saying so the house is well equipped with kitchen resources.,,,,,
The train system in Boston is very easy. While it maybe a 20 minute travel time to the house it was very well worth it. To get away from city life and have a peaceful and enjoyable stay.,,,,,
Would we stay here again,Yes!,,,,

2014651,17662252,2014-08-15,18107717,Pamela,Nik and Molly are great hosts and their apartment is quite charming and roomy. Our three night stay was just great. There was a nice little pub just around the corner and the T was close by as well. I would highly recommend staying with them.
2014651,19489115,2014-09-13,20697659,Anna,"Molly and Nik were great hosts! They were welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable without intruding or feeling obligated to make small talk. They are both cool people with good area recommendations for food, beer, coffee and Boston area attractions. Room was as described. I would recommend Molly and Nik's place to other self-sufficient people as a comfortable place to stay."
2014651,19903216,2014-09-20,18066962,Juan,"The Molly's house is a clean, convinient and very nice place. In adittion, she and her husband are very friendly and they will give you good advices about Boston"
2014651,20317354,2014-09-27,6599928,Julia,"Nick & Molly were really nice and helpful. They have a charming house, with a nice patio & kitchen, both of which we made use during our brief stay. The train is close to the house and it's a pleasant walk through the park to get to it."
2014651,21230332,2014-10-13,15087870,Caroline,"The listing description is 100%accurate.  The apartment is really big and lovely.  Nick and Molly are adorable and really go over and beyond to make you feel welcomed. The neighborhood Jamaica Plain is really nice, walking distance from Franklin park and Jamaica pond and about 15min from downtown Boston by Subway.  Great experience!"
2014651,22086244,2014-10-29,21914447,Danica,"My stay at Molly and Nik's place was a great experience. Nice location, homey pad, close to orange line T and with plenty of street parking. I highly recommend staying here!"
2014651,22498364,2014-11-08,19439722,Roy,"Molly and Nik were very helpful and welcoming. The room is as described and the neighborhood was nice and quit, but with a T stop close by. Highly recommended."
2014651,28846247,2015-03-30,5025493,Christine,"What a fabulous first experience on airbnb. Molly and her husband Nik were perfect hosts - so lovely, welcoming, and accommodating. The space was exactly as they described - comfy bed with great natural light, ideal location, funky cool space with lots of art and instruments lining the walls and the hammock was SOOO COOL. My boyfriend and I had our coffee and breakfast (both complimentary and very delicious thanks to Molly's handy pantry) while swinging in the hammock. JP is my new fav Boston neighborhood - a few minutes walk to Franklin Park (go see the forgotten bear cages) and a couple blocks from Midway bar where my boyfriend played a show Saturday (Molly and Nik came to the show and danced with us!). Check-in was seamless - Molly was amazing and really helped us out with an early check-in. Nik gave us some awesome Harpoon brewery tour tips. All in all a totally perfect weekend - fun, relaxing, and exactly the little getaway we wanted. Thanks so much, Molly and Nik! Definitely be back :)"
2014651,32589090,2015-05-19,32216201,Pierre-Olivier,"Super bien accueilli, Molly nous a tout de suite mis à l'aise en nous montrant l'appartement et ses commoditées. Molly et son conjoint sont très respectueux de l'intimité des autres. Très agréable séjour"
2014651,33322438,2015-05-26,10646637,Nick,Great apartment in a lovely little part of JP (five minutes to the T was a bonus + great hammock). Molly was a great host and made us feel very welcome. Highly recommend!
2014651,34503055,2015-06-08,34691214,Ben,"My mom unfortunately didn't particularly like her stay, mainly because the bed was firmer and shorter than what she's used to. She was also kept awake by noises from the kitchen."
2014651,89133337,2016-07-27,85270672,Xavier,We had a great stay at Molly's place!
2014651,90379318,2016-07-31,3059183,Balazs,"Molly and Nick were really experienced and nice Airbnb hosts , they perfectly know the needs of a guest. Their place is overall as on the pictures, cozy quiet and heartful. I warmly recommend it to everyone."
13045194,78047786,2016-06-05,56481003,Jennifer,"Great little apartment with a nice roof top patio. Nice neighborhood, comfy beds, short walk to everything we wanted to see. FYI - two flight of spiral stairs to get to the apartment may be difficult for the elderly."
13045194,78535333,2016-06-07,60046322,Brittany,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and my family and I were very happy with Brendon's apartment.  The location was great and very convenient, and we were pleasantly surprised with how new the apartment was, the amount of space, and the roof deck.  We messaged Brendon when we arrive to inquire about the wifi password and the parking spot, and he responded right away.  I definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in Charlestown, near Boston.  We had a great time and appreciate the experience."
13045194,78806504,2016-06-09,60002852,Katie,What a great apartment! I came into Boston for work and this was the perfect place to relax after a full day of meetings. The rooftop deck is amazing! All of my coworkers were jealous of my accommodations. It's close enough to everything that you can turn out of the apartment literally onto the Freedom Trail and easily get into downtown by foot. I'll definitely be staying here again in my work travels. Brendan was great and super responsive with getting us the information we needed to get into the apartment.
13045194,79581248,2016-06-13,28858174,Leanna,"Great location, clean and spacious apartment. Steps from the freedom trail. The patio is beautiful! While we didn't meet in person, Brendon was available by text and was super helpful and available anytime to us for questions, and accommodating for us to leave our car later in the car park after we checked out. Would definitely stay again!"
13045194,82745444,2016-06-29,78169711,Gs,"We love Brendon's Place! It was very clean, bright and happy...we could walk to the Bunker Hill Monument, the USS Constitution Monument and there's even a Whole Foods within walking distance so we could make the meals that we are accustomed to. Brendon responded quickly to any query we had and our trip went very smoothly while at Brendon's! Thank you for your place!"
13045194,83132109,2016-07-01,76799314,Viviana,The location was excellent. When we arrived the prior guests had checked out late and cleaning was still taking place. The roof deck was a plus. The only issue that we had was trying to get into the apartment on the first night because the top lock did not work properly. We locked it and then realized that it wasn't unlocking. We spent an hour trying to figure it out. I called and text Brendon multiple times and did not get a response from him. I did not get a response at all. I was disappointed at the lack of communication after the lock situation. The apartment is located in a great location. You can walk over the bridge and it leaves you in the North End which was very convenient.  The furniture and appliances were clean and modern.
13045194,84058626,2016-07-05,70198302,Weslie,"Brendon's place was perfect for our trip to Boston. Great location, plenty of space, and amazing roof deck views. We'd definitely stay there again."
13045194,84893336,2016-07-09,77573398,Ian,"It was a wonderful stay. Brendon made check in and out very easy. Place was clean, In a great location and had a sweet rooftop deck"
13045194,85627058,2016-07-12,75705409,Thomas,"Communication was good regarding entry and parking information,"
13045194,86252332,2016-07-15,77798718,Pamela,"Brendon told us that we would have a great time and we really did just that. We loved the location, rooftop deck, tv sitting area and the kitchen. There's wonderful natural light in the space. If you have difficulty with stairs, this might not be the place for you because the stairs are steep and curvy (They reminded us of our stay in Amsterdam - steep stairs!)"
"The keys needed to be labeled and tell your guests that the deadbolt is tricky and how to \"\"jiggle it\"\" etc. We had trouble getting in the place and still aren't sure what the red key is for.",,,,,
We would've felt more welcome if there had been a guest guidebook giving us basic information about the place such as food sharing guidelines,how to operate the barbecue/where to buy propane and providing an adapter for this,suggestions for where to pick-up groceries and nearby restaurant recommendations especially for the first night when you've traveled all day and would like to go to a sure thing for a great meal.,,,
The dishwasher was smelly! There must be a way to remedy that... Not very appetizing when eating in.,,,,,
There was only one air conditioner and thankfully a fan to pull the cool air towards the bedrooms but when we got there it was stiflingly hot and took about 2 hours for the place to start cooling down. An extra fan,,,,,
would be super,one for each bedroom for better sleeping.,,,,
The neighborhood is quiet and the parking space is just a few dozen steps away in another building and super convenient and covered. We loved that!,,,,,
There wasn't hot water when we arrived and one of our friends was able to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) how to fix it but who wants to be troubleshooting at 10 pm so that we could take non-cold showers?! Our friend had to fix it 4 times during our stay which is not what one should be doing on vacation. Brendon was traveling and returned my text the next day and said he would be by to have a repair guy fix it. After that,there were no more problems getting hot water.,,,,
The kitchen appliances were fantastic especially the stove! We loved the kitchen! The stove fan is a bit noisy as is the air conditioner but we were glad to have air conditioning.,,,,,
Checking out guidelines would be helpful such as do we start a load of laundry before we leave? Do you want folks to run the dishwasher,etc?,,,,
Giving your guests simple guidelines would be helpful so that expectations are clear all around.,,,,,
"There's some cosmetic work in the bathroom and bedrooms that needs to be completed but overall the place is fun to stay at!\"",,,,,
13045194,86955414,2016-07-18,57812577,Bj,"Perfect location, perfect place to stay.  Our host was easy to communicate with and helpful in finding things to do.  The apartment was cozy and functional and right in the heart of a quiet neighborhood.  Easy access to the North End.  I will stay here any time I am in Boston.  Our host and his place made our first experience in Boston pretty awesome."
13045194,87857926,2016-07-22,73969656,Delphine,Le quartier est top : tres calme et il est facile d'atteindre downtown.
C'est un quartier bien fréquenté.,,,,,
Nous avons diner dans un pub irlandais à 3 mn de l'appartement,typique tres sympa ou jeunes  et moins jeunes se fréquentaient.,,,,
The appartment is well equipped and nicely arranged.,,,,,

13045194,90785332,2016-08-02,77670990,Ómar Geir,Brendon was a great host.  He answered our questions very quickly and helped us in any way he could.  The apartment was clean and very nice.  The location was very good and the neighborhood quiet and nice.
13045194,92182768,2016-08-07,72553247,K,"Pro's - great location for accessing the Freedom Trail and downtown Boston; neighborhood is very quaint and a few great places to eat very close by; free parking is a huge plus; kitchen was well stocked with dishes, etc., water pressure was good and the mattresses were all reasonably comfortable.   Con's - while the building is well maintained, it is old and so does not have central AC - a window unit is provided, but it is noisy and to keep the whole unit cool, the bedroom doors had to be kept open; also, it is two flights up rather steep stairs to get to the living level of the unit - if you are not able-bodied this would be a real problem, although we were able to haul up the suitcases fine."
13045194,94364772,2016-08-15,11129933,Vincent,"We had a great stay at Brandon's place. The appartement is very comfortable and perfectly hosted our family of 5. All what we needed in kitchen or bathroom was available for us. Huge roof top terrace. 10 minutes walk from Community college metro. Everything was perfect, thank you Brandon!"

"\"",,,,,
13045194,95975824,2016-08-21,3363209,Frederick,"Brendon's apartment has a great location, convenient to everything in central Boston. The unit itself is fantastic, we had five guests and everyone was very comfortable. The apartment is well maintained and stocked with amenities (but would have loved a few more coffee Keurig pods instead of the hot cider ones).  The private rooftop deck is the crown gem -- super spacious, lots of seating, with an great view."
Caveats: the stairways are very steep and narrow,just something to watch out for if you have mobility trouble. The deadbolt to the apartment can be a little tricky to figure out -- I believe the trick is to turn right a bit,then left all the way.  The unit has a single AC in the living room,which is very powerful,but unfortunately doesn't reach the bedrooms,so you'll need to leave the doors open and have the fan blowing the cool air into the rooms.
Brendon was great with communication,quick to respond and accommodating with any issue/requests. Unfortunately for our stay there was a problem with the housekeeper,so the apartment had not been cleaned and we were asked to launder the linens. Brendon was very upfront about this and refunded the $80 cleaning fee. But still,our first plan upon arriving to Boston was not do a load of laundry.,,
Overall,I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston,"especially good for a larger group. The rooftop really makes it a great value.\"",,,

7746589,46629722,2015-09-12,42148443,Mike,Incredible place and location.  Very clean and had no issues at all with my trip!
7746589,49658454,2015-10-05,41961468,Marie,"The place is clean and neat. It is well situated, just next to a subway station and close to the Freedom Trail start."
However,we were a bit disappointed since we registered for 4 people (2 couples) but had only bed linen for one bed.,,,,
No one answered the various phone numbers we had listed and it was only after a couple of hours that we got a reply to our email about this issue.,,,,,
Also the hairdryer wasn't working.,,,,,
Finally the place is more like a private hotel than a homestay acomodation,"which isn't bad but feels a bit weird for an Airbnb.\"",,,,
7746589,50328087,2015-10-11,20327764,Kim,"Brent's place was awesome! I rented one of the one bedroom apartments for the week while in Boston for business. You can't beat the location, it's located across from the Broadway T stop, Starbucks, Stephi's and practically next door to this new Southie hot spot that just opened, Worden Hall. The apartment itself was immaculate. I had a king bed to sleep in, full kitchen, spacious bathroom, wifi and cable TV. The space was super clean and had everything you'do need from towels to a hair dryer. I would definitely stay here again!"
7746589,50689523,2015-10-13,32128380,Adrianna,The description was accurate and there was no host. I do like the distance to the train and the cleanliness. It was perfect for my weekend trip to Boston. I recommend this for first timers to Airbnb. It is close enough but not too personal.
7746589,50963535,2015-10-16,654513,Michael,"Great place, great location!!  The apartment is in a great location.  Easy to get in and out of and a good jumping off point for the city exploring.  Host was great to work with and in the information provided was very accurate."
7746589,52084202,2015-10-26,30377757,Marco,The stay was spectacular!!  Great building and wonderfully situated closed to the “T” and shops.  Would definitely stay again and I would highly recommend it to friends.
7746589,52488673,2015-10-30,43141211,Paul,"This is a clean and comfortable apartment located just across the street from the Broadway T stop.  Very convenient and accessible for public transportation.  It is well layed out with nice furniture.  Unfortunately the cable didn't work, but wi-fi was available to watch movies on our laptop.  It is also managed by a short-term rental company, but that shouldn't deter you from renting.  The company was responsive and had a streamlined process to get into the apartment.  Overall a positive experience."
7746589,53146079,2015-11-05,4031661,Ali,"Brent and his team were prompt with email replies and gave us all the details about how to access the premise and what to expect. Admittedly a lot of the rules felt a little overwhelming at first and perhaps even a little off-putting, but do make sure to read all of it!"
As for the flat itself,it's a wonderfully kept,spacious,and comfortable place to stay for a couple or small family,especially if you're in town for at least a few days. I feel like it could be too big for one person to stay in for a day or two.,
While I was there for my 3 night stay,the fire alarm went off a couple of times and was on for a while before being taken care of. This was a slight inconvenience but it may have just been a bad day. The management eventually got to it and resolved it.,,,,
Having the T station for the Red line right across the street is very convenient,too,though the street noise can get a little loud on some busy nights. There are a couple of eateries around too but not too many choices,so if you're hear for any more than a few days,be prepared to use public transport / uber a lot.,
All in all,it's a great stay in a good spot with a prompt and attentive host. If you're visiting with a companion for a few days,"I would strongly recommend you to consider this place.\"",,,
7746589,53894395,2015-11-14,26000118,Matthew,Listing was as described. The keyless entry to apartment building and apartment door were very convenient. TV & Wifi were a plus. The iron and ironing board were clutch. Definitely recommend this listing for those in need of a great location for a week/weekend trip.

7746589,82957269,2016-06-30,33249672,Brad,Great location - Right across the street from the Red Line.  Many eateries nearby along with a grocery store. Very comfortable bed. and very clean.  Internet is sometimes spotty but there are multiple SSID's to try.  No elevator so be prepared to walk up some stairs!  Street traffic can be a bit noisy and the blinds to do not block out the outside lighting as well as a solid shade.  Laundry facilities is a plus!  Highly recommended place for a Boston stay!
7746589,83424227,2016-07-02,72530735,Scott,"Perfection! The place, the location, the communication, well done!"
7746589,86815292,2016-07-17,70458212,Harmen,"Briljant place. Subway station (red line!), Starbucks and Subway (for eating) literally across the street. So you can get out of bed, walk across and get coffea and breakfast (and take it back to bed if you want). Also very simple to get there from the airport! On red line to MIT and Harvard in 20 minutes or so, or switch to green line to e.g. Boston University. Many restaurants around and Brent provides a list of places to be aware of. You can also walk (30 mins) or take a bus to beacht at the end of the street (East Broadway). Boston is such a great place and this is just the place that makes it very easy to fully enjoy the stay."
7746589,93033383,2016-08-11,3214986,Jonathan,"This is a really lovely space with a fantastic location.  It's literally across the street from the T train station, with numerous other restaurants, Starbucks, etc. immediately around.  The apartment itself has nice light, a spacious bathroom, and a kitchen with everything I needed.  Getting in and out was easy with the numbered door lock."
The only issue was in the morning: there was no running water anywhere,including the hallway bathrooms.  When I called and texted the maintenance number the book in the room listed to call if needed,no one ever returned my call.  My e-mail was also not returned during my stay that morning (until 11:00).  Such a lack of responsiveness during such a time was disappointing.  A few days later,we eventually came to a satisfactory agreement about resolving this problem,but not without multiple e-mails,including one in which I was memorably obliged to explain why having no running water means a bathroom isn't useable (!).  I'm glad we came to an understanding.
Apart from that water issue,which was just bad timing I suppose,I had a lovely stay here.  It's a great place,space,"location!\"",

We were the first guests of the house and so everything was brand new. There were some minor problems: no toilet paper,no mirrors,no much equipment in the kitchen.... but I'm sure this was due to the fact we were the firsts!,,,

Jeff was more than accommodating and welcoming--chocolate, snack bars, and water were available, as were coffee and teas.  We had the good fortune to meet with him twice, and would love meeting with him again.  The beds were super comfortable, and there were extra linens and comforters in case we needed to set up the sleeper sofa.  Sleep came easily, and security was never a question.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat."

Location: ideal,,,,,
The apartment is across the street from the Downtown Crossing T station,no car traffic,a couple block away from so many of the tourist and historic stops. It felt like we were in a great position to be near enough to North End (my fave!),Financial District,Boston Common,etc to walk everywhere.
Apartment: perfect,,,,,
Both beds were great,and the couch was super comfortable! there were 2 air mattresses as an option as well. Great living room and kitchen area,perfect for recovering from a long day out. Felt very secure (2 doors to pass through before the elevator) and was able to let guests in easily with the buzzer/video phone.,,,
Hosts: attentive!,,,,,
Jeff responded to my messages asap,and when needed,had an employee over within hours to help us (we needed a hairdryer). The caretaker company's employee who greeted us was great as well! There was a multi-page manual we pulled recommendations from (The Merchant for dinner,"and Thinking Cup for coffee!) that was incredibly valuable.\"",,
7914359,52933500,2015-11-02,19596411,Erin,We had a great time. The apartment is in a great location. Jeff was very helpful in helping us find a garage for parking. The apartment was perfect for the four of us.
7914359,53195812,2015-11-06,14392084,Mel,"We arrived to local artisan chocolate as stated, and a hotel-like experience. Fresh towels, clean space, everything you would expect. The concierge service was prompt and helpful with the key exchange."
If you're sharing the space,go for the back bedroom,as the front bedroom is near the elevator shaft,and the noise could keep a light sleeper up at night. I sleep with white noise,so wasn't an issue for me.,
Everything was solid. Location was great,you can walk pretty much anywhere. The proximity to The Freedom Trail is great,if you're into historical treks. I'd definitely stay here again.,,,

7914359,53688675,2015-11-11,31982708,Jordan,"Our stay at Jeff's was great!  Excellent downtown location very close to shopping, eating, and nightlife.  The apartment was very clean and supplied all amenities that we needed.  I would recommend staying here to anyone looking to stay in the heart of Boston."
7914359,54111008,2015-11-16,45067708,Vanessa,"The place was great and exactly as pictured. The arrangement for the key was easy and well organized. The apartment was in a great very central location--perfect for walking around and enjoying the city. It was so clean and stocked with coffee, clean linens/dishes, and everything you need to be comfortable! I'd definitely stay with Jeff again. Great place and great host!!! Thanks, Jeff!"
7914359,56068373,2015-12-08,49655394,Craig,They met me a at the apartment when we arrived.  Everything was exactly as described and we had a great experience. There was plenty of room for the five of us and it was very well priced.
7914359,56406222,2015-12-13,13608998,Randy,"Jeff's place was absolutely perfect and in the heart of Boston. We loved our trip so much (thanks in large part to the accommodations) that we ended up extending our trip. Unfortunately, Jeff's unit was already booked and we had to stay at a hotel. The beds and linens were top-notch along with personal touches like high quality shampoo, body wash, complimentary KIND bars, bottled water, etc. We also really enjoyed chatting with his assistant Kiera who showed us into the unit and made sure we were comfortable before she left. We will definitely try to stay here again for our yearly December trip to Boston. Thanks so much Jeff!"
7914359,57656386,2015-12-28,2144382,Adam,"The Apartment was perfect.  Very clean and professionally serviced with they keys and the departure.  Perfect location in the heart of downtown crossing, close to all trains, and despite the location, very quiet in the apartment.  I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Boston from out of town."
7914359,58040575,2015-12-31,49824884,Jack,Apartment was as advertised.  Very nice. Great location. Was able to drop luggage early and explore while apartment was being cleaned. Great first experience with Airbnb.
7914359,58595397,2016-01-03,28276877,Raj,Great location.  Condo is spacious and clean.  Our hosts graciously left treats.  Easy to find.
7914359,59131257,2016-01-07,49120513,Annika,"We enjoyed our stay in Boston in Jeff's appartement. We were greeted with chocolate and nut bars, but we would have prefered basic cooking ingredients like salt/pepper and cooking oil - this belongs to a fully equipped kitchen too, as indicated in the description. The appartement is luminous with all the lights on, but there is hardly any daylight coming in. This didn't disturb us so much as we were outside all day long to explore the city. The appartement has a good location in downtown. We took the subway (downtown crossing station just across the street) a few times, but everything is also in walking distance. Shops are nearby. Check-in was arranged to our comfort - thanks a lot! Jeff responds very quickly and is helpful. The appartement was also very clean and provided enough space for the five of us. Overall, a great stay!"
7914359,59480099,2016-01-11,47857674,Chris,Overall our stay was great.  In a pretty good location with lots of stuff to do in the area.  The apartment had plenty of space for the number of people it sleeps and was very clean.  I was happy to see that there was Starbucks coffee in the apartment.  I am not sure if this was in the lodging information however it was not I would recommend adding for those who are driving from out of town.  The street the apartment is on is not necessarily accessible by car and we had an issue with the GPS due to that.  Our flight was delayed so we arrived later than expected but that was not an issue and we were met at the apartment and able get in upon arrival. We had a great stay!
7914359,61297696,2016-02-02,4878590,Andrew,Wonderful house in the heart of Boston. I highly recommend both the host and apartment.
7914359,62718558,2016-02-16,16666469,Tanuja,"The apartment was exactly as listed.  It is very conveniently located in the heart of Downtown Boston, walking distance from lots of sites.  It was clean, bright and spacious.  We enjoyed our stay and will come back again."
7914359,63240723,2016-02-21,45780144,Sara,"Lovely apartment in a great location, right next to shops and other amenities. Spacious and comfortably fitted 6 of us in. Very easy to get keys, even at awkward times and all involved were quick to respond to any emails. Well equipped kitchen - appreciated the tea and coffee there on arrival."
7914359,63506965,2016-02-23,11988166,Yu-Chen,"It's a very convenient location for transit and shopping,you can get everything you want."
7914359,63732825,2016-02-26,47845462,Xue,Excellent apartment in the heart of Boston! Each of my friends likes their so much! Fantastic! Highly recommend!
7914359,64217962,2016-03-01,28154049,Roanne,Our stay at Jeff's place was great. The location is perfect!! We were three couples and found it an excellent home base.
7914359,66277958,2016-03-20,55206155,Lisa,It was in the most perfect spot anything and everything was around there. It was definitely in the heart of Boston very safe. Will be staying there again when I go back for work. Lisa Flynn
7914359,66904525,2016-03-25,25850812,Jill,"Great apartment in the best location in Downtown Crossing. You are able to walk to anything in downtown Boston.  The apartment is as picture/described and it was very nice to have extras like shampoo and conditioner, extra soap plus snacks and coffee/tea in the kitchen."
We were four people for six days and had plenty of space. Beds are comfy and extra towels were provided. A nice perk!,,,,,
Laundry machine is down the hall and requires quarters,should you need it.,,,,
"Overall a great stay in a very nice apartment with wonderful amenities - Thank you!\"",,,,,
7914359,68395131,2016-04-04,12443203,Hans,I have never been in contact with Jeff. However Jeff was very accommodating and responded promptly to my emails.
"The appartement is managed by a professional management company.  Clean but a bit steril and not a lot of natural light.\"",,,,,
7914359,69190568,2016-04-10,5062596,Helen,"The key exchange is very efficient as you are able to arrange a convenient time with a management company. We were then provided with 2 keys, which was helpful. The building is clean and modern inside, and the apartment has great facilities. A dishwasher was a real perk! The location is absolutely ideal for exploring Boston. Please note that the only windows are in the bedroom and look out over walls. Great communication and I would recommend this apartment."
7914359,69690578,2016-04-12,52434122,Rob,"Well coordinated key hand-off!  The place was clean, nice and is in a great location.  It's a quiet unit as well.  We never heard a sound around us."
7914359,71312347,2016-04-24,2853270,Audrey,"The place was very comfortable and clean, and Jeff and his staff were very accommodating and responsive. The location is really a dream, right in the shopping pedestrian street, right at the subway, close to central station and even walking distance from the convention center. There were amenities for us to use (toiletry, snacks) and the beds were very comfortable. The only thing is that there is no window in the living room, no direct light at all, and the bedrooms have one big window each hit it gives on a brick wall so no direct sunshine also. Not the best place if you need sunlight!"
7914359,73755326,2016-05-09,46863591,Janessa,"Jeff's place was clean, spacious and convenient. The Downtown Crossing locations was great to be able to get around Boston and Cambridge really easily. I would highly recommend this spot!"
7914359,74561973,2016-05-15,25375167,Mackenzie,"Jeff's place in Boston was perfect. Plenty of coffee shops and restaurants nearby (he left an outline with some of the best places too). It was very welcoming to see towels laid out on each bed with enough toiletries for everyone. The space itself was very clean, new, and comfortable. Easy to get to as well - about a 15 minute ride from the airport, or an 8 minute walk from South Station. Would highly recommend this to anybody looking for a great place to stay in Boston."
7914359,74869800,2016-05-17,70999435,Chris,"The apartment was fantastic, very clean and plenty of room for our group of six.  The location was right in the center of everything we needed and all had a great time.  The key exchange was quick and easy.  Thank you Jeff!"
7914359,75066729,2016-05-18,28016047,Jay,"This apartment is in a great location! Steps away from public transportation, great food and shopping all around it. I really appreciate the cleanliness of the apartment. And my husband loves how tall the shower head was! All in all a great trip, great host and fantastic apartment. Would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in Boston."
7914359,75349956,2016-05-20,18470059,Andong,"Honestly it's the one of the most comfortable places that I have stayed in. I visited New York and Boston with my gf's family. Our bus terribly  delayed.  When we arrived, there was a young lady waiting there, greeting with smile and giving us a tour with patience. The space is large enough to accommodate 5 people. Fully equipped kitchen including silverware, toaster, coffee maker, salt & pepper, etc. The host was so considerate that even separately prepared towels, shampoo/gel for each room. Jeff did not show up personally but I guess he has a good taste of art cuz we found there were several Chinese paintings on the wall. Finally, this apartment has a perfect location, just beside the Downtown Crossing station which led us to nearly everywhere conveniently."
"Thanks Jeff for giving us a wonderful trip on Boston.\"",,,,,
7914359,75628788,2016-05-22,23746619,Dave,"The apartment was clean, quiet, and had everything you might need.  The location was great and Jeff and the apartment management service was very responsive.  They even let members of my group drop their stuff off earlier than the agreed upon check-in time, so we appreciated that.  I recommend this place to anyone interested in going to Boston!"
7914359,76154435,2016-05-25,8180026,Regan,"Jeff was very responsive - provided clean towels with shampoo, conditioner and soap for each guest."
7914359,76773986,2016-05-29,55388983,Danielle,We really enjoyed our stay at Jeff's apartment. The check in process was very easy. The apartment was as advertised and was incredibly clean and well appointed. The location is ideal for walking to most major attractions in Boston. I would stay again if I return to Boston.
7914359,78716633,2016-06-08,11024963,Shane,"This was a great stay at a great location. It's right downtown - about as central as you can get in Boston. Tons of food options all over, as well as historical landmarks. There's a T station (Downtown Crossing) a stone's throw away from the apartment as well, so pretty much everything is accessible. If you choose to uber or cab, you'll have to walk a couple blocks to reach the doorstep, as this area in downtown is pedestrian only most of the time - but it was totally not an issue for us."
I'm not a huge fan of working with 3rd party Airbnb caretaker companies to pick up the keys,but I suppose that in this location that's more necessary. Just know that you'll need to schedule an exact time to meet someone to receive the keys (as opposed to grabbing them from a lockbox or something).,,,,
Also to note - I was concerned about the noise level with this apartment being right downtown. However,the building is nice enough that it was practically silent in the apartment - very conducive to a good night's rest!,,,,
Thank you Jeff!,,,,,

7914359,79881272,2016-06-14,67239856,Pippa,"Great apartment in the middle of downtown commercial district.  Lots of space, well-equipped and nicely decorated.  Beds are comfy - even the sofa bed was good according to my kids.  Strong wifi, secure building. Convenient to Quincy Market, Boston Common, the T.  And the people who run the place are fantastic. Thanks, Jeff!"
7914359,79989265,2016-06-15,18867392,Elyssa,"This is not someone's house but a place rented out all the time to people like ourselves. As such, it's not very homey but it had everything we needed for an overnight stay. It's very clean, has great amenities (like Kind bars and water bottles for us!), and was comfortable."
7914359,81652300,2016-06-24,20891181,Bill,"I wished we had more time here but we had to arrive late and leave early. Ideally situated as a pied a terre in the city for a group as large as ours (5). The Roche Bros. around the corner makes it easy to grab coffee, breakfast or groceries. Being met with the key at street level and shown the way upstairs was a nice help."
7914359,82157503,2016-06-26,71995967,Michael,The description of the property was 100% accurate. Perfect space for 4 people. Our original arrival time was delayed by 2 hours and the people handling the key exchange where more than amenable. Upon arrival there was cold water in the fridge and Kind Bars and Chocolate in the kitchen. Perfect location downtown and right next door to the T. While the property is in a very busy and loud part of town you cannot hear anything from the apartment.
7914359,82945039,2016-06-30,19247284,Sofia,"Jeff was always available and answer every question that we had. The apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable. The location was great. I recommend it!"
7914359,86104715,2016-07-15,13434039,Huan,The apartment is very clean. We arrived earlier and the assistant met me in the doorway and delivered the key. The localtion is the Best. I would recommend to stay in the apartment.
7914359,88237248,2016-07-23,59997615,Matt,Our family of 6 stayed here for 3 nights to see the sights around Boston. The location was really convenient and the apartment worked great for our needs. Lots of stores and restaurants within easy walking distance. Host is very helpful and accommodating.
7914359,89630602,2016-07-29,74786403,Chris,"The location is wonderful.  Parking around the corner.  Lots of food and shopping options.  Easy walk to many attractions.  The apartment is clean with plenty of room.  Jeff was very responsive and helpful.  The check in/out process is simple.  Recommend this place to anyone staying in Boston.  We stayed as a family of six, including 3 kids.  So perfect for a family, couple, or someone traveling on business."
7914359,90869119,2016-08-02,65449894,Anne,L appartement est tres bien situé à Boston. Deux grandes chambres spacieuses avec beaucoup de rangement. Séjour confortable avec une cuisine pratique. Nous avons passé un super séjour. Je recommande. Le propriétaire est attentionné.
7914359,91240991,2016-08-04,80796189,Yong,We have great two days in Boston and in Jeff 's apartment. It's so comfortable and so quietness. Thank you Jeff welcome to Beijing.
7914359,92087607,2016-08-07,4233684,Suzanne,This is an awesome apartment in an awesome location. It is spacious and comfortable for four people. It is surprisingly quiet as well! The management company was easy to work with. We had a great time exploring the city  from the apartment.
7914359,92913663,2016-08-10,24606473,Aditya,"A very warm cozy apartment, opposite to all the large stores, right in the heart of Washington street, the esplanade is very walkable through the lush Boston Commons. I enjoyed my morning run beside the river Charles. It's a very clean comfortable pad, large enough to house 5 people. It seemed a little overpriced in the beginning but everything important to see in Boston is so walkable. I have never met Jeff personally but his presence is felt through the guidebook of Boston that he has left for the guest in the apartment. I loved every bit of this beautifully designed space."
7914359,94453036,2016-08-15,61787516,Marc,"3 pièces parfaitement équipé, décoré façon design. L'atout principal de l'appartement est son emplacement dans la partie piétonne de Washington Street en plein centre ville. Situé à 2 mn du Boston Common, LE coeur de Boston, du démarrage de la Freedom Trail, ou encore de la red line pour aller visiter Harvard. Vraiment idéal pour découvrir Boston."
Nous avons vraiment aimé. En outre,échanges avec Jeff le propriétaire très faciles,"efficaces et cools. A recommander et louer sans hésitation.\"",,,
7914359,95091379,2016-08-18,50815260,Julie,Very accurate description and the place was lovely!
7914359,96076487,2016-08-21,88997498,Giovanni,"Was received on time, the apt was nice and centrally located.  Jeff was very prompt in accepting our reservation."
7914359,96857567,2016-08-24,19258689,Brad,"We had a wonderful stay at this apartment with our four kids.  It was spacious enough for all of us, and in the perfect location for touring Boston, all within walking distance. While it was located on a very busy street, the apartment was extremely quiet."
7914359,97757372,2016-08-28,4005036,Colleen,"We had a great stay at Jeff's apartment in Downtown Boston. Jeff was extremely responsive before and during our stay with small questions, often getting back to me within the hour."
The apartment itself was just as described. The bedrooms were the best feature of the apartment: spacious and comfortable beds and bedding. The apartment also seemed to have great soundproofing. Perfect for two couples staying in tight quarters,who want to spend the weekend together but also have their own spaces to retreat to. Jeff was kind enough to leave a few small refreshments and coffee as well,which was a nice touch. The location is great,centrally located between the North End,Beacon Hill,Newbury Street
A couple caveats worth mentioning: The apartment is clean and updated but bare bones,"it feels like a \"\"corporate apartment\"\" - not a real \"\"cozy\"\" feel if that is what you're looking for. There are also no windows in the main living space",and the bedroom windows face a brick wall - so very little natural lighting. That said,there is a lot of overhead lighting & lamps in the main area to combat this. Lastly,it is smack-dab in the middle of the very busy downtown retail chain shopping area: FYI depending on what you are looking for.,
Overall we had a great stay. I will be back if I am looking for a clean,"centrally-located apartment from which to explore Boston!\"",,,,
7914359,98731339,2016-09-01,92281807,Jenny,We were staying in Boston for a few days and preferred alternative accommodation to a pokey hotel room. As a family of 4 adults we found the apartment was just what we were looking for. Location was fantastic in the centre of the city making everything very accessible. We would not hesitate to recommend this property.
7914359,99349726,2016-09-04,60661885,Chhay,Nice place and good location.

5317935,32321147,2015-05-17,8986966,Tony,Bandita was very gracious and accommodating. She answered all my questions promptly.
5317935,44987430,2015-08-30,4920274,Gill,"We had an awesome time staying at Dita's home. It is absolutely beautiful, and her description of the house is very accurate. There is so much room, everything was clean, organized, and she even left us things to make breakfast. Dita was also always available for any questions we had and made us feel so welcome. If you are looking for a place to relax with family and friends that has easy access to the heart of Boston, this house is perfect!"
7825327,50049439,2015-10-08,44271363,Drew,The host canceled this reservation 190 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The spacious living area/kitchen was very good to do some office work. Aihua was very helpful and flexible at all times. She provided information whenever needed and responded quickly. We would be happy to stay here again the next time!"
7825327,52249956,2015-10-27,36268544,Tony,The room wasn't  clean as we expected
7825327,52502947,2015-10-30,20737520,Eugene,She was very helpful. Responsive. Apt as shown. Good cost for what we got. Good utensils and kitchenware. Including dishwasher
7825327,54737081,2015-11-23,36583255,Patrick,We had a great weekend in this apartment. The space was very clean and was well represented by the photos. We would repeat.
7825327,73293394,2016-05-08,47401605,Dennis,Excellent unit as described near Northeastern University and the Ruggles Station on the T Orange Line.  The apartment has high speed wifi and a Chinese fast food restaurant in the first floor.
To access the apartment you need to climb four stories of a narrow staircase; this unit is definitely not handicapped accessible !  It was well stocked and updated with stove,microwave and even a coffee maker !,,,,
The host,Aihua,was very courteous and contacted me in advance and we had no issues whatsoever.,,,

7825327,80670122,2016-06-19,26802395,Guillermo,"Aihua se comunico en todo momento para saber si estaba todo bien, muy cordial y amable. La ubicacion del apartamento es ideal, muy tranquilo y cercano al centro."
7825327,88115442,2016-07-23,280558,John,"We booked this apartment for a week long work trip. Overall the stay was decent. The apartment is in a great neighborhood close to everything, was clean, and has good amenities. Keyless access is nice with a larger group too."
However,Our check in was awful. The host did not meet us at the apartment after stating in the original communication that they would. The access information they gave was incorrect leaving us locked out and they were not reachable by phone or text for over 2 hours. The lock out was an honest mistake on the hosts part,but not showing up or being reachable by phone is unacceptable in my book.,,,
Also,this space is not accurate to the listing. There are only 3 real beds,not 5. It can only sleep 6 people (if they are couples) comfortably,not 8. That put me in a tight spot with 6 people coming in from out of town tired and needing their own bed! Thank god for the couch and another air bnb near by to book.,,
I would consider booking again with the knowledge of knowing what the apartment is actually like and the host realizing that they have to be in communication at least within the first hour of check in.,,,,,

7825327,89874819,2016-07-30,84583151,Kristin,"We wanted to stay in an old building and this one was great. We had trouble figuring out the AC (some instructions would be helpful) but it was fun to walk up to the 4th floor and see the exposed brick and look out onto the street from our bedroom window. Check-in was a breeze. The beds are AMAZING, an often overlooked feature in a rental. There aren't a lot of pans for cooking which we did a few nights. Two bathrooms were great to have. It was a good experience in Boston that our family will remember."
693353,5416592,2013-06-29,5965513,Marcail,"The apartment was clean and comfortable and in a great location - had everything I needed! That said, the apartment was not the same as the one in the picture. It did not have have the dining table and chairs, and had a slightly different layout. It was very similar though, so suited me fine. Beware if you have heavy bags, I had to haul mine up four flights of very narrow stairs. Otherwise, a great stay."
693353,5993963,2013-07-25,4990567,Julia Maeve,"The accomodations at 17 Garrison were exactly what I was looking for - clean, comfortable, close to my conference site, and with a kitchen so I didn't have to eat out every night. Seamless transition helped me book this apartment when the one I originally requested was full, which was a great help. Lovely experience, would definitely stay again."
693353,7966284,2013-10-10,1757867,Lee,"This is a lovely apartment in the middle of Boston, close to everything. The unit had everything we needed -- enough kitchen utensils, coffee maker, etc. -- to eat in, plus the bedroom is separate from the main room, giving late sleepers privacy. We'd recommend this place to anyone, assuming they're physically capable of climbing stairs. This unit is on the top floor of the building."
693353,8600285,2013-11-07,7898619,Carinne,"Reserving and getting to the apartment were easy.  At first we had the wrong code in our email for the front door but there was a friendly person at the other end of their phone line who helped us even at 10pm!

I was in town attending a 3 day conference at the convention center. The apartment's proximity to a number of hotels made it painless to catch free shuttle buses for the conference. I found it so nice to be able to walk to Newberry St., Beacon Hill, Faneuil Hall, and the convention center. Would absolutely plan to stay here again in the future."

The house is lovely,clean,and it was a pleasure to live in it for 2 days. The big TV screen in the living room is amazing,with a lot of free movies! Also,the sofa is very comfortable.,
You can either choose to take the metro at Shawmut,and you cross a quiet and lovely neighborhood,or go to Fields Corner,where there are a lot of stores and retailers on the way.,,

2754975,17091532,2014-08-07,868405,Codrin,"The apartment is located in an ideal area of Boston, within a short walking distance of all of Boston's treasures. The apartment is not overly large but is well furnished and fits 4 with no problems. My kids had no complaints about the pull-out sofa, which is rare. The bed is comfy, the bathroom functional. We barely used the kitchen but it looked perfect for short stays. The apartment faces the street (3rd floor) so some noise in the morning reminded us that we lived downtown. Unbelievable rooftop patio with 360 views of the Boston skyline. Our car was parked for the duration of the stay and we used public transportation and walked across town. Boston has a human feeling to it, unlike NY. The building is secured by a concierge, even late at night. There is a convenience store downstairs and Whole Foods within 5min walking distance. You will love your stay as much as us, we guarantee it!"

2754975,28251824,2015-03-21,407030,Hannah,"Jonathan's apartment is located in the perfect part of Boston, with the main attraction of Boston Common within a short stroll, and right on the edge of the beautiful, elite Beacon Hill area. The building is secure, with lovely doormen. The apartment was clean and spacious, and provided most amenities wanted. A drawback was that the shower would at odd times suddenly go scalding hot for a few seconds (the only warning being a small change in the sound of the pressure about a millisecond before it abruptly changed). This was unrelated to water use within the apartment. When I gave Jonathan a heads up that the apartment hair dryer was an Australian one (not a problem for us, as we had a converter), he went out and bought a new one and put it in the apartment while we were out. While this was a very prompt reaction, and a nice thing to do, it made us slightly uncomfortable because all our belongings were spread out because we hadn't anticipated someone else being there. Please note that Jonathan asked us to sign a complex legal rental agreement after we had booked (something not advertised pre-booking), which we were wary of because it would have superseded our Airbnb rights. After expressing these concerns, he waived our need to sign it. Overall, though, a good apartment and a fine host."
2754975,28665075,2015-03-28,5097867,Gísli,"We enjoyed our stay in Beacon Hill. Jonathan's apartment is truly in the perfect location to explore the city. It's clean, spacious and has a wonderful roof deck."

It seemed like everything we wanted to see was within a 10 minute walking distance,otherwise the Park St station which was only a 5 minute walk would get you on a train. The apartment was immaculate and there was more than enough space for 2 people who weren't a couple.,,,,

We took advantage of having a kitchen for breakfast and lunch and had all the necessary utensils.  We also liked the view from the roof terrace.  The apartment  was clean and nicely decorated.  Again, location, location, location.  Basically the freedom trail began across the street.  Jonathan was very responsive .  We will be back again!"

The 10th floor rooftop deck alone was worth the price of the stay-absolutely stunning panoramic of Boston, the Charles River, and Cambridge."
Sitting at the tip of the Boston Common right off of Park St. and Beacon,the location is perfect. All of the major sites -other than  those that the apartment is virtually on top of- and historic destinations are all within (5-20) minute walking distances in this very walkable town.,,,,
Jonathon was super accommodating,always got back to us within minutes of our questions/emails. A very gracious host.,,,,

We were there with two small kids, so we were looking for a little space and a centrally located location where we could walk to activities.  It's a 10 minute walk to Faneuil Hall, 15 minutes to the NE Aquarium, and 1 minute to Boston Common.  I believe it is comparably priced to some local hotels, but you'll get more space.  We didn't use the stove or oven, but having a kitchen is a big plus.  We would certainly stay here again."

2754975,81867687,2016-06-25,31457218,Ailsa,"The location of this condo is suburb, and close to everything you could possibly wish for. We enjoyed our stay here very much. Being next door to Boston Common is a huge plus. When we caught the ferry to Salem for our day trip, it only took us 15 minutes to walk to and from the long wharf. When we wanted dinner out locally we went to the Merchant, which was delicious. The convenience store downstairs was open late and stocked lots of little things we needed during our stay. To orientate yourself for the city, we recommend the $16 City View Trolley, as that stops nearby and is great value as an intro tour."
Our bed was a standard double,with a slightly lumpy mattress,but the sheets and covers were soft and tasteful,and the room was pleasant. The bathroom felt opulent with marble floors and walls. Our 12 year-old slept on the couch in the lounge room. It was wide and comfortable,so we did not bother folding out the sofa bed for it. The view from the rooftop terrace is outstanding and makes for great photography opportunities.,
The building is an old dame,and therefore a bit tattered internally,as you might expect. The people living there were all civil and pleasant. While the condo did look exactly like the online photographs it was more well worn in real life than I expected. Still,everything functioned as it should. Because the place is so compact,things are tucked in all sorts of places and we understand that’s just the way it has to be,but it does make for limited space with regard to everything relevant to the kitchen.
Jonathan is a good host,and was very helpful with regard to our late arrival. As we got in after Midnight,and I’d anticipated that possibility,he kindly sent the front door key across the globe,so that we could get in without delay when we finally got there. Check in was therefore easy and we corresponded about it by messaging after our arrival.,
This is a great place to stay in a top location,and we certainly recommend it to others. It is old world in style,so you need to have an empathy for that kind of place. To my mind it was not unlike the famed Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan.,,,

The most impressive feature of this place is Location. Cant’t be better. Perfectly well communicated and within a walking distance to the most popular points of interest. It is in a luxury,historical and safe building,with a concierge on duty most of the day hours.,,,
The owner has been really helpful,kind and responsive and it has been very easy to get hold off.,,,,
The house rules are very detailed and give a lot of useful information (how to get there,where to park,where to buy some food,what to do with the luggage …).,,
The apartment itself is decorated in a traditional style,which matches perfectly with the building aspect and history. The listing is spacious and comfortable and is well equipped. A very useful characteristic: everything in the apartment is clearly labeled,which makes very easy to find and put it back everything you need.,,,
Unfortunately,the host Jonathan was in Colorado when I stayed at his place and I could not meet him. Nevertheless I had an intensive and effective communication with him (before and during the stay) and I realized that he is very kind and efficient.,,,,

The host's roommates were extremely nice and friendly and they gave us some tour guides to the city, which made our jobs a lot easier. The only downfall is that the room is really small but if you are only there to sleep and shower, it's not a problem at all. The bed is in fact super comfortable and AC is available. This is probably the best deal you can find in Downtown Boston - Chinatown."

The neighborhood is quiet and walkable and has many amenities and shops. It's also close by the T and buses, which was very handy."
2077794,19965443,2014-09-21,5114272,Amish,"We were kindly welcomed by a friend of Anya, who kindly showed me around and left me the keys. The apartment is less than 5 minutes from the train station (Forest hills) and only a few stops from Back bay and downtown. The JP area is very lively and vibrant, lots of places to dine at. There was a local pub a few doors down which Anya recommended, worth a visit. Anya was always around via e-mail to answer any questions I had."
"The apartment was nice and in a pleasant urban area.\"",,,,,
2077794,24503547,2014-12-29,8538743,Jean,"Anya's apartment is very clean, comfortable and well located. She was very helpful with suggestions on where to go around her nice neighborhood, and the train station is very close by."

Thank you Anya and thanks to you Daniel,,,,,
"And was nice doing business with you.. So long guys\"",,,,,
2077794,47855695,2015-09-21,28557792,Diana,Anya was a very kind and considerate host.
2077794,51364156,2015-10-19,42282726,Lizzy,"We really enjoyed our stay at Anya's place, it was clean, quiet and In a lovely neighbourhood. Jamaica plain is well worth an afternoon visit, lots of vintage shops and coffee bars, lovely vibe and people. Anya's place was continently located to the orange line which heads straight into Boston. Great stay."
2077794,66313448,2016-03-21,16784997,Alex,"Anya was kind and welcoming, and responded graciously to a very spur of the moment/short notice booking.  The place was charming and spacious, comfortably distant from the main street in a moderately active (and rather trendy) neighborhood."
2077794,90823009,2016-08-02,16648667,Martin,"To start with, we stayed one month, so makes a big difference from staying in a place for few days, We never met Anya but she was very responsive, her friend waited well after midnight to let us in, another friend helped to install the aircon etc, really nice. You can park on the street without a permit, big deal in Boston. The place is charming but as so many rentals in Boston is urgent need of renovation, the bathroom is really really small and really outdated. The full size bed is a full size single, we did not manage to sleep on it with two, neither the pull-out sofa nor the air mattress worked for us. The apartment was clean but so cluttered, with papers on every desk, every shelf filled, personal everywhere etc. so it felt more like intruding into somebody's place, and even more intrusive when he had to move these things to make the place usable. It is a nice neighbourhood  and several restaurants etc in walking distance."

This was my third time staying in one of Jason’s apartments and each one is better than the next.  This two bedroom was perfect for my family of 3 and the North End location was perfect for exploring Boston with the family.  There was so much to see and do just down the street from the apartment.  The apartment had the best beds and had so much space to spread out - plus it was really quiet.  In addition to Jason’s fantastic hospitality and great decorating skills, we had the pleasure of meeting Jason’s father – Larry - and finally taking them up on their harbor cruise / sail aboard their yacht – Kayla.  This was the most incredible way to see Boston Harbor and Larry’s sailboat was absolutely gorgeous.  Finding out the yacht had been used in The Town – a famous movie filmed in Boston – made the experience that much cooler.  Thank you Jason and Larry for another great stay and a wonderful sail.  We can’t wait to come back and stay with Jason."
14204600,90839635,2016-08-02,43386538,Kay,AMAZING. The unit was spotless and the location was amazing. Literally in the heart of the North End and just 1 block to endless restaurants and the Waterfront - we were able to walk everywhere.
In terms of the apartment,the living room was a great place to watch movies at night and the beds were super comfy.  We didn't need to cook with all the restaurants just steps away,"but the kitchen was fully equipped and Golden Goose Market was just down the street. We had a couple of questions about getting around and Jason was extremely accommodating in helping us. Can't recommend this highly enough. We'll be back for sure.\"",,,
14204600,92548386,2016-08-09,86885274,George,Great location. North End is beautiful. The house was perfect for four.
14204600,92873009,2016-08-10,33375290,Nancy,"This was a wonderful nice clean place to stay. I would recommend it to everyone. Jason was great and very accommodating, my son arrived before me, and that was not a problem, Jason was a very gracious host. He even offered us a place to keep our suitcases after check out, while we took care of a few things in town. You are missing out if you don't stay here!!"
14204600,93199252,2016-08-11,88143498,Andrea,Jason was excellent in response time and answering my questions!  Apartment was beautifully appointed and accurately described.  Enjoyed roof deck and the quiet street.
14204600,94148530,2016-08-15,86730759,Frank,The unit was super clean and the location was amazing. You were 1 block from the Old North Church and everything else was within walking distance (ex. the aquarium was less than a mile away). The living space was very well organized and the beds were very comfortable. We didn't stay in much so we didn't utilize the kitchen at all but everything seemed to be well stocked. Jason was a great host answering all of our questions before we came down and checked in on us occasionally. Would and have recommended the place to others if they visit Boston.
14204600,95388987,2016-08-19,31080172,Dorinda,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jason's place in the North End. The location was perfect, right on the Freedom Trail and within easy walking distance of shops and restaurants. We had immediate access on arrival which meant  that we could start sightseeing straight away. The facilities within the apartment were excellent, everything worked and matched the description and pictures. It was clean, tidy and perfect for our family of 5. It would have been better if there had been a window in the second bedroom and in order to accommodate 5 people we needed to use the blow up mattress in the sitting room. Lots of working appliances in the kitchen made cooking easy for us. We would highly recommend this listing."

We had the pleasure of meeting Dean and his roommate as well and they were wonderful hosts.  Thanks!"

We had a terrific stay at their place and we enjoyed our Boston experience therefore very much. And by the way, the foto in Deans Inserat is true. But what we liked most, was the excellent hospitality from Dean and James. They were very helpful and kind at any time and everything was fine. When I will return to Boston maybe next year, I will definitely ask Dean again, to find a place for me to stay."
2636365,12224824,2014-04-26,14338060,Piper,"My friend and I stayed with Dean and his roommate for two nights and we really enjoyed our visit. They live within an easy walking distance to a metro stop, and they were both very helpful with site-seeing, they even took us to a favorite local breakfast restaurant on their day off from work. Clean apartment with great views! I would stay with them again."
2636365,12477703,2014-05-03,6180967,Anna,I've been with my boyfriend in Dean apartment for 2 nights in April. The room was small but clean and comfortable.
Dean is very nice,polite and sports lover. We chatted a long with him just arrived. The apartment is well decorated and we felt free to move and to use the kitchen for breakfast.,,,,
It was a pleasure to meet Dean!!,,,,,
Thank you very much!!!,,,,,

2636365,12956587,2014-05-15,7274602,Samantha,"Dean was a super gracious and hospitable host. We arrived while he was out so we used the key from the lock box. The room was exactly like what was listed. Everything was clean and prepared for us. We had no problems at all. The area was pretty cool with a lot of restaurants and cafes to walk to. The block we were on was a little less exciting than we imagined, but overall great experience staying with Dean. Not complaints. Super nice guy."

2636365,13094501,2014-05-19,12549264,Joy,"Dean and I saw each other only briefly since it was a very quick weekend trip into Boston for me and I was outside of the apartment helping my friend most of the time, but for the short time we did see each other Dean was very friendly and engaging during the short chat we had ."
I got in late the first night I was in the city,which wasn't a problem at all,and the next morning when I woke up I bumped into Dean having breakfast in the living room.  I formally introduce myself to him and then we had a nice little chat about natural hair,facial hair (he has a cool waxed mustache),and fabrics.  He gave me a few breakfast spot recommendations and then I was off for the day.,
I didn't have much time to explore the area,but his apartment was centrally located and there were eateries and public transportation very close to his place.  The room that I stayed in looked exactly as pictured and was quite tidy and comfortable.  Everything that I needed,which wasn't much,"was available and  I liked that he had bath towels ready and waiting for his guests.  \"",,

The apartment is well located not far from subway. The room was just a little bit noisy at night.,,,,,
Anyway,"this is a place to recommand. \"",,,,
2636365,14473583,2014-06-20,14665001,Andrea,"My friend and I had the pleasure of staying at Dean's for a week earlier this month and we could not have picked a better place in the city! The apartment was spotless when we arrived, with fresh sheets and towels provided for us (a big bonus, since towels take up so much room in a suitcase), and we always felt welcome to use the shared spaces. Dean and his roomie James were extremely accommodating and friendly, always ready with a suggestion for a restaurant or bar to visit."
Great location,as it's close to the subway (about a 5 minute walk) and many neighbourhood spots to scope out,plus if you enjoying walking and taking in a city,this is a great starting point to hit all of the sights (Prudential Center,Newbury Street and Tremont Street are a few of many that we saw). Also,it's got a great view of the city from the living room windows!
I recommend this place for anybody planning to visit Boston,I would definitely stay here again if possible the next time I'm in the city. Thanks!!!,,,,

2636365,14846185,2014-06-27,1246388,Sandy,"Dean and James were great hosts, they were great with accommodating our last minute requests to stay as well!  The room was clean and comfortable (although a bit small) to stay in, and the living room is spacious for hanging out.  The location has easy access to the green line (10 mins walk) and very close to the orange line as well!  Would recommend if you're looking for a reasonably prized place to stay!"

The place was clean and prepared for our arrival. Dean and James were very welcoming and had great suggestions of where to go and what to see in Boston. It felt more like staying with an old friend rather than staying with strangers.

The room is exactly as it appears in the pictures and my girlfriend and I found our host to be very friendly in a laid-back, but polite way.  Clearly wanting to make sure we had everything we needed but not smothering us or too attentive either!  It's very possible we'll be staying there again, but in the meantime, can definitely recommend the place to anyone else looking for a room close to Boston's South End."

The room was very nice,not too small,but it is dominated by the bed so if you really need floorspace the common area works better.,,,
The neighborhood is fine,right on the edge of college territory so it is is easy access to all sorts of places. (Not quite on the main road,but close enough),,,

Location is close to the metro and a bunch of good restaurants and entertainment. Wally's Cafe, a jazz club, has some amazing talent, definitely worth checking out. We had a busy weekend and only crossed paths with the guys a couple times but they were welcoming and helpful. I really appreciated jumping in on James' Game of Thrones session to catch the last episode I missed. This was our best Air BnB experience, and we would definitely recommend staying here."

The keys were in an easily found lockbox outside, which makes it simple to access the place if/when Dean can't be there personally. We only met Dean briefly at the end of our stay (during a very intense hailstorm!). Even so, we communicated regularly while we were in Boston, and we had everything required. The room is on the small side, but not less than expected, and perfect for two people not spending much time at home while on holidays. Great crash pad, and very nicely designed making great use of a small space. Very good transit access, either by the subway Orange Line or rapid bus Silver Line. We didn't find any supermarkets to stock up on groceries, but admittedly we didn't look that hard. The kitchen would have had everything required if we had chosen to cook."

2636365,49456091,2015-10-04,41580993,Christine,"Jamie and Dean were great hosts and we enjoyed our stay. The T stop is about a 5-7 minute walk and from there you can get pretty much anywhere. The view was nice from the room, the biggest challenge for us was probably the 4 flights of stairs with luggage (it's a traditional Brownstone walk up, so no elevators) and the room was snug (there is literally room for the bed, we had to squeeze the luggage into the closet when not in use) but you're not in Boston to hang out in your room. The room was clean and towels and hair dryer were provided, so we were set. We were nervous about bathroom schedules but it never seemed to be a problem. All in all, a super-affordable way to stay in Boston."
2636365,51539913,2015-10-21,42516580,Emmanuel,"Logement correspondant à la description, propre, bien équipé avec une superbe vue sur la ville. Quartier calme, proche des transports, commerces et restaurants. Avant et pendant le séjour Dean nous a bien conseillé."
2636365,55905882,2015-12-07,35542772,Freek,"My stay at 94 Hammond Street was absolutely amazing! Dean and James let me feel like this was my new home. I stayed for a month in their apartment. Dean and James are both busy, and hard workers. Although, we spend some time together, ate the best 'Thanksgiving meal' (thanks to James), run around Boston with Dean. I loved how the both of them let me enjoy my stay. If there was anything they would help me out. Again, thank you so much for this wonderful month in Boston."
2636365,68451250,2016-04-05,9087540,Jessica,"My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying at Dean's place.  The location was convenient, a 5 minute walk to the subway station.  We didn't have much interaction with Dean or his roommate, but Dean was always responsive to my messages.  They provided great accommodations; nice bed, clean sheets and comforter, a closet with hangers and towels. The shower was cleaner than most hotels I've stayed at, which I was really happy about.  Would definitely stay here again!"
2636365,79151747,2016-06-11,29683576,Kathy,Everything was great. Dean thanks for all. Your house is great and you are so kind.

Seine Unterkunft ist so gelegen,dass man Bostons Innenstadt gut zu Fuß erreichen kann,es geht auch per Bus (die Busfahrer waren sehr hilfsbereit).,,,
Wir fühlten uns sehr gut aufgehoben. Das Zimmer hat Dean sehr ansprechend ausgestaltet. Wir konnten uns wie in der eigenen Wohung bewegen und auch die Küche benutzen.,,,,,

7986179,77580835,2016-06-02,44614249,Michelle,Jared was an excellent communicator over the airbnb website as we arranged our trip. We were very grateful for his flexibility as we had to check in late. I would definitely recommend.
7986179,83748866,2016-07-04,7171285,Zac,Jared and Liz made our trip to Boston very easy! I would 100% recommend staying at this flat.

7986179,99894468,2016-09-06,30380458,Min,"Jared and Liz have a lovely home in the Jamaica Plains. The location is close to the Orange Line and getting to a T stop takes less than 15 minutes on foot. You can also opt to take the bus to downtown Boston, which is even closer (around 5 minutes on foot)."
The apartment itself is spacious and had the old house feel down to the T,along with the customary creaky floorboards and gas stoves,which I found to be quite charming.,,,
The only things I'd advice if you were to stay with Jared and Liz are to bring your own shower products and ask for a spare blanket to be made available to you.,,,,,
Overall,"great stay!\"",,,,

So sweet and made sure we were comfortable and even showed us some great places in the neighborhood to explore.  Apartment was clean, linens were clean. Just the right size for me and my husband for a few nights. Check out KO Pies, Shangrita Cafe, Italian Express Pizza for amazing meals."

The apartment is lovely, spacious, has a large living room and perfect dining room table as well as a fantastic full kitchen! Our hosts provided us with detailed information about the area, and the apartment was decorated with lovely antiques.  Furthermore, it was spotless!  We just returned from our stay on some of the hottest days in July and the apartments air conditioning was fantastic- comfortable and cool the entire time.  Additionally, the apartment is literally a 3 minute walk to the water taxi - a most beautiful ride into the wharf!  Cannot wait to return- I could not have asked for a better experience. Thank you!!"

I visited during my birthday and not only did they offer bagels and fruit for my stay but I had a surprise birthday cake waiting for me in the refrigerator. Such a nice gesture! They were pumped full of information regarding nearby sights, restaurants, activities."
As for the apartment,it was perfect for me. There's a bus stop at the end of the corner or you're about a 10 minute walk from the Maverick station. You're roughly a block or two from the water so you can enjoy some great views and a short walk from a beautiful park that overlooks the Boston city skyline.  Also,a quick 10-15 minute walk to the airport.,,,
Thank you so much Theresa and Linda! I had the best time staying at your listing! :),,,,,

7035556,46631698,2015-09-12,2241783,Barbara,I really enjoyed staying at Harborside Abode. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to spend more time relaxing in the lovely living room and wandering around the neighborhood. My time was consumed by the conference I was attending.
I did get to walk around a bit one evening. The views across the harbor are beautiful and the people in the neighborhood were very warm and friendly.,,,,,
Linda and Theresa went above and beyond with extra touches. They were available,but not intrusive. I will absolutely stay here,again! The price and convenience are unbeatable,"especially compared to the price of even basic hotels in Boston.\"",,

I can't begin to say enough wonderful things about the home, area and hosts. To begin with, Linda and Theresa were so very accommodating. They gave a great description of their home and it was well worth every penny. They were wonderful and helpful in assisting us to navigate around Boston. Their home was only a 7 minute walk from the train stop which was also one stop away from the aquarium in the city of Boston. We will definitely be contacting them again!"

The apartment itself is in a fantastic location in East Boston, but it is very close to downtown too! You can take the T one stop to the aquarium and you are downtown in 2 minutes, a taxi also takes less than 10 minutes! We can't thank Linda and Theresa enough, we hope to return to Boston soon!"

The apartment is large and very comfortably furnished, with a mix of well-kept antique furniture and modern couches, and Linda and Theresa have put their skills as antiquarians to good use decorating the whole apartment with  beautiful sketches, portraits, and paintings. The house itself is located in a quiet, tree-lined neighbourhood in East Boston, conveniently located within walking distance of the water taxis and the \"\"T\"\" tram line"
Linda and Theresa truly act like family towards their visitors,taking the time to chat with them about the neighbourhood and their recommended spots to visit,and even checking in to make sure they've made it back to their own homes safely at the end of their trip. They go out of their way to provide those things that really make a great stay,including providing toiletries (in case you forgot something) and local bread or bagels for a quick breakfast before you head out.,,

Before and during my stay, they inquired into my comfort and made themselves easily available to answer questions. They are welcoming and sociable but also perfectly respecting of your space."
The neighborhood was very convenient for me,as I could walk to my conference at the Hyatt. This would also be the case if you were flying in or out of Logan. East Boston feels like a little village on its own,"but it's easy to get to the \"\"mainland\"\" by tube or water taxi. Being so near the harbor was a real bonus.",,,

Theresa and Linda were very helpful and informed me in good time how to access the property.  The apartment was well well stocked and the bed was comfortable. The T train was a comfortable 10 minutes walk away and then I had access to downtown and Revere beach. The other great thing was that it was close to the airport. if you have not got too much luggage the T train is only one stop away or taxi ride costing $12.50. on the final day Linda and Theresa let me stay in the apartment as I had a late flight, which was very kind of them and meant my last day in Boston was relaxing and comfortable Thankyou"

It is very conveniently located close to the Harbor, T train, great restaurants, and the Logan airport.  You really do not need a car unless you plan on sightseeing outside of Boston. The description of the apartment is exactly as written and it was perfect for our vacation. The hostesses are great with communication and making sure you have everything you need during your stay.  I highly recommend their apartment and will definitely stay here again if we get the chance to return to Boston."

Vicki provided us with a great welcome packet with info about restaurants and getting around town."
Things to note for other renters - one of the beds is a fold-out bed that worked fine but wasn't very comfortable (felt like a college dorm). We also did not have access to hangers (for our clothes),"so is not the most comfortable setup for business-related travel. \"",,,,

The flat itself is gorgeous and meticulously taken care of, with well-matched decorations and a rooftop balcony where we enjoyed breakfast and the harbor view every morning. Vicki's flat is easily accessible to the rest of Boston via public transport (bus close by or a pleasant walk along the ocean+ the T) but the fact that there is a parking space is very nice too.

It's also a very bright apartment which I liked but with good blinds to block out the early morning light! I was visiting Boston for a conference in the World Trade Centre - this was an easy 30 minute walk away but there was also a convenient bus route for when I was feeling lazy! There is a beautiful beach nearby, we had good weather so it was lovely to be able walk down to it. I travelled with my parents, we liked having access to the kitchen to make meals etc and not having to buy things like salt and pepper etc was handy. One minor comment from my parents who are about 70 years of age was that they found the stairs in this apartment steep - however at 30 years of age, I did not find this a problem. We enjoyed the set-up of Vicki's TV - access to TED talks, netflix as well as standard channels. This was nice for relaxing in the evenings. On arrival I realised we had not brought towels but luckily Vicki had left out a set, including face cloth, for each of us. I thought this was a nice touch. There is also a second toilet, which is handy for a group."

She even left us coffee and blueberry bread..delicious. The house was immaculate, the location private and quiet. We especially enjoyed the rooftop deck. We couldn't be happier(URL HIDDEN)"

The long couch is comfy to sleep in, and there's a blanket and fan to ease you into the night. The red line (subway) is right around the corner, so a great location, too. An enjoyable stay, and a great value overall."
Also,make sure to check out their music with the awesome speaker in the living room before you leave. Good stuff:,,,,

7475215,49012470,2015-09-30,41477105,Jaroslaw,Great location. The apartment itself was exactly as advertised and in good standard. There were few small bits and pieces requiring attention but host was very quick to respond and fix/solve problems.
7475215,55007053,2015-11-27,47331483,Ryuji,"Everything was quite fine and comfortable! Alicia was so kind that she gave me quick replies every time I send messages. Location was so good and accessible to several markets nearby, and a kitchen equipped with a number of dishes and silverware were convenient for the long-term stay. I really wish to stay the unit again next time I come to Boston."

7475215,85974446,2016-07-14,29767328,Yusaku,Staying in Alicia's room on Newbury Street was wonderful.
it could be the best location for tourists. my favorite Trader Joe's is just a minute away,Deluca's Market is right next to the building,CVS is right across,Prudential tower is also a minute away,coffee shops,restaurants
the room was very clean,quiet,decent sized for two guests.,,,
Easy and simple check-in/out.,,,,,
the windows are facing to the back alley,so the view from the windows was not really interesting,but it didn't bother me and my girlfriend at all. we stayed there for a week,we really had a very relaxed and fun vacation.,,
the only thing i didn't like about this room was that there was no hand soap in bathroom,and also no detergent,no sponge to wash dishes/cups/pans after using. so we had to go CVS to buy some stuff for the kitchen.,,,
otherwise,"I really love this place!\"",,,,
12897110,80684435,2016-06-19,75181211,Kyle,"The stay at Nicholas' apartment was great! My fiance and I travelled with another couple, neither of us having ever been to Boston. This place was the perfect spot for us. It was within walking distance to Fenway Park (unfortunately my Mariners lost), the shopping on Newbury St, and around the corner from the city tour that we took."
The apartment was nice,clean,and cozy. There were clean towels & sheets for both couples. One couple slept in the bed and the other couple slept on the brand new air mattress that Nicholas had provided. Both the bed and the air mattress were very comfortable. I had no problem falling asleep either night. Also,having your own private entrance was incredible.,,
Overall Nicholas was a fantastic host. Every question that I asked from booking,during the stay,"and after the key had been dropped were answered quickly and happily. He even provided us with a couple of bottles of wine to cheers to our first time in \"\"Bean Town\"\"! We couldn't have asked for a better host or a better apartment for our trip to Boston. We hope to be back at some point!",,,
"Thank you Nicholas!\"",,,,,
12897110,83840324,2016-07-04,12711348,Peter,"Nicholas was a great host, set everything up for us and was very welcoming and communicative.  Even got us some stuff to eat and a bottle of wine.  Location was perfect, right across from Pru center.  One of us slept in the bedroom and one on the air mattress in the living room, both very comfortable.  Would definitely stay chez Nicholas again next time I'm in Boston"
12897110,85276419,2016-07-11,42909056,Bonnie,"The neighborhood was great, bordering on Copley Place.  It was only one block from the Marriot. The host was very responsive to messages prior to and during the stay.  The apartment was large enough for 3 people (a couple and a teenager).  The reason for my low rating was that I saw a mouse run across the living room floor. We then saw some mousetraps around, so the host knew about the problem beforehand.  If he takes care of this problem, my rating would be 4 out of 5."
12897110,87699699,2016-07-21,80758214,Anthony,I was in town on a graduation trip with my mother. The apartment is in a perfect location. We walked to  Fenway park to see the Red Sox. The apartment is also walking distance to Copley square and the public gardens. Hotels next door were nearly 3 times the price of the stay here. If I were to stay in the city again the first thing I would do was see if Nicks place was available. You won't find anything else  with this prime location for this price. Nick was a great host and was very quick to respond to any questions we had and was also able to suggest places to check out in the city. We called him when we landed and he helped us navigate our way to his place. I highly recommend staying here.
12897110,88689968,2016-07-25,13002958,Sharon,Nick was available to us through texting and email.  He left food in the fridge and the air conditioning on.
12897110,90426017,2016-08-01,49218698,Kasia,"The host was incredibly accommodating. We didn't arrive until around 2 in the morning, so the late check in was convenient. He left a bottle of wine and food for us to eat, so breakfast and late night drinks were free. Whenever I had any questions, Nicholas was incredibly attentive. We must've harassed him with questions 10-20 times throughout our stay and he responded almost immediately each time. The location was AWESOME. Would definitely stay here again."
12897110,91833691,2016-08-06,35264471,Belén,"La ubicación es ideal. Nick es atento y maravilloso. Se trata de un apartamento en planta baja que da a un parking. Las ventanas no son practicables. Parece como el semisotano donde vivía el portero. El baño necesita actualización. Nosotros pasamos 3 noches y nos habríamos quedado más si hubiéramos podido. Es un alojamiento singular porque estas a pie de calle. El inconveniente era el ruido de los coches al entrar y salir del aparcamiento. Pero no se producía muy a menudo. Lo mejor, aparte del anfitrión, el equipamiento. Tenía de todo, incluido comida en el frigorífico para desayunar. Cuando volvamos a Boston, nos volveremos a alojar aquí. La relación calidad precio magnífica."
12897110,94080395,2016-08-14,22632979,Jialin,Nicholas was responding timely to my requires! Perfect location! It is great for a family vacation in Boston!
12897110,97727074,2016-08-28,66570568,Liani,"We had a wonderful stay in Nic's apartment. When we arrived he met us and took us through the apartment, to show us how everything worked. Nic left us breakfast and pizza in the freezer, which is great when you're new to the area, and haven't had a chance to explore yet. Nic's apartment is located close to a shopping centre and there are many restaurants in the vicinity. It was a wonderful location to kick off our exploration of Boston."

2215762,14964569,2014-06-30,14947437,Brad,"Beautiful little apartment conveniently located in South End, lots of things around. Very well designed, extremely comfortable, with everything you need to stay independently! Cooking no problem. Laura was very helpful to us. Definitely recommended!"
2215762,15642431,2014-07-13,9417022,Courtney,"Laura was a fabulous host as always! I have stayed in one of her other flats before and this one was just as lovely. Great location, beautiful space and everything was extremely easy with the booking, etc. I will definitely try and stay here again the next time I'm in Boston."
2215762,21071627,2014-10-11,4950198,Florence,"It was honestly an amazing three month stay for my wife and I, for several reasons. First of all, the flat is awesome, quiet, sunny, and very well furnished. We enjoyed very much working there, relaxing, or having a romantic dinner. Secondly, Laura, the landlord, is a wonderful person. She is gentle, helpful, respectful, discrete, and very nice to interact with. Last but not least, the South End district is probably one of the best locations in Boston. It is a very mixed neighbourood, with tons of parks, sport fields, great restaurants, cool bars, and the flat is very close to Back Bay train and metro station. What else ? We will definitely come back !"
2215762,23008874,2014-11-20,22258070,Paulo,"I spent 30 great days in Boston. The gorgeous Laura's apartment where I stayed in was an important part of this amazing experience: beautifully decorated, great neighborhood, easy to go to anywhere - and Laura was a wonderful host as well. I intend to come back to Boston, and it will be perfect to stay in this same lovely place. I do recommend it."
2215762,39723812,2015-07-26,550496,Lars Iversen,"Me and my girlfriend stayed five months in Laura's beautiful South End  apartment. It was the perfect home for us for many reasons: Great location! (safe and cool and a lot of of good restaurants nearby); the place was very clean and neatly organized when we arrived and had basically all the equipment we needed to live there (incl. hair dryer, flat iron, towels, fully equipped kitchen etc.), and a dishwasher in the apartment and laundry machines one floor above made our stay even more convenient; Laura was consistently quick and helpful in her communication, and she went great lengths to ensure that we had the best stay possible; as an AirBnB host, she was all you could wish for. The apartment feels very open and bright. It was nice and warm during the cold, cold winter, and air conditioning made it refreshingly cool during the warm, humid summer. Neighbors were friendly and quiet. We would recommend this stylish and comfortable place to everyone and will definitely stay here again if we will get the opportunity."
2215762,45237071,2015-09-01,27742517,Veronica,Had a great visit. Laura was the ideal host - quick to answer any email and very friendly without being at all intrusive. We appreciated her advice on local facilities and events which added to us enjoying the local area.
The apartment is clean,compact and well equipped. Bedroom small but the layout worked. The AC performed well which was essential in the heat and humidity of Boston in August. Plenty of towels and linen and wifi access excellent.,,,,
Location is perfect for Back Bay T,Copley Square and Newbury Street but also the more arty area of South End. Fun.,,,,

2215762,52690014,2015-11-01,26221962,Ruediger,"A delightful apartment in a charming building in a vibrant neighbourhood! Lots of nice little restaurants and shops in the vicinity. Laura was extremely helpful and responsive and made my stay very pleasant. E.g., I had two family members visiting me for a couple of days and she organised and extra comfortable bed on very short notice. I can highly recommend Laura's place and would go back there in a heartbeat."
2215762,55657549,2015-12-04,23880650,Liwen,"Laura was really nice and was helpful with all my questions. The apartment is in a fantastic location and I could walk everywhere. The room is clean, cosy and homely and very comfortable for our family. The laundry room is a real bonus. We have had great time staying at Laura's place. Thank you, Laura!"
2215762,61146997,2016-02-01,42852594,Ameet,"We relocated to Boston from Glasgow in December 2015 and needed a place for a month while trying to sort out a more permanent housing situation. Laura's apartment was the perfect choice. Conveniently located within walking distance to Northeastern University (new job), short walk to Back Bay area and Boston Public park, not to mention the excellent food scene in the South End."
The apartment itself was great. Extremely clean,well organised,and functional - just about everything we would need for a month long stay. I won't expand much on all the great features of this place as the previous reviews already mention them. Also the nice thing (which has been uncommon from our experience) was the reliable/strong WIFI signal. Streaming on netflix - never had a problem.,,,
Laura was a fantastic and responsive host. Since,we have now found an apartment just around the corner,we are thrilled to have her as a neighbour now.,,,
"\"",,,,,
2215762,64310383,2016-03-02,48951141,Kasra,We relocated to Boston and needed temporary accommodation while we searched for an apartment. Staying at Laura's beautiful and well managed apartment definitely helped us overcome all the stress of relocation. Laura is the most wonderful and responsive hostess one could asked for. She's usually around the building and checks in frequently enough to make sure you're enjoying your stay. Her gorgeous apartment is very clean and has all the essentials. The apartment is very centrally located and close to all the nice restaurants and venues. We would definitely have Laura in mind when we have visitors in town:)
2215762,67847524,2016-03-31,14765362,Chris,Laura was extremely helpful and responsive. A fantastic experience all around!
2215762,71981750,2016-04-30,22814322,Monique,The apartment was true to the photos and well equipped for a short term stay. There is a detailed booklet providing all the information necessary. The neighborhood allows to get the feel of the South End.
Laura was welcoming and provided quick responses to any questions.,,,,,
Thanks,Laura!,,,,

2215762,83166371,2016-07-01,61912589,Bruno,"Hi everybody! My name is Bruno, I spent two months in the beautiful apartment of Laura as visiting scholar in Boston Northeastern University.  Without any rethoric accent, I enthusiastically recommend this amazing accommodation! Her house in the city is strategically located in a central, thriving, attracting neighborhood like South End, a wonderful urban Victorian fabric, only few minutes on foot from a lot of the most important and central attractions of Boston.  Laura is an amazing landlady, always present, taking care of her guests and any possible specific need and request. I had the opportunity of having interesting conversations about the evolution of the Boston lifestyle and several aspects of the urban policy and I was impressed by her competence and intelligence. The way in which she chose furniture and organized the indoor space of the apartment reveals her aesthetic sensitiveness and refined gusto. Should I plan again to spend some weeks in Boston, I will definitely ask to be her guest again. Thanks Laura, and all the best! I hope to see you again very soon! Bruno"
2215762,90910993,2016-08-02,62966814,William,The location was perfect the apartment was clean.  My wife and I totally enjoyed our stay in Boston.
2215762,95639495,2016-08-20,29274655,Fernando,"It's a really nice small place in a great location. Although small, it has so much sunlight that the spaces feel very open and everything is bright. The location is unbeatable, a 5min walks to 5 of my favorite restaurants in the entire Boston area. 9min walk to the orange line, 5 min to the yellow and gray bus lines. The place is very clean and the host will set the expectation to keep it that way."
6053700,33273659,2015-05-26,1348270,Bonnie,Sybil was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.  The house is beautiful and comfortable.  It's a special place to stay and it's location is great--it's so very central to all of the awesomeness of JP.
6053700,36793154,2015-07-01,1348270,Bonnie,"\"This house is beautiful, comfortable and extremely unique.  It is an amazing location in a wonderful neighborhood.  I cannot begin to say how much it has meant for my family to stay here--we live in the neighborhood and had water damage to our home--and being here has been the silver lining to a very difficult time for us.  Sybil took care of us at every step--making sure we had everything we needed.  She was also very flexible about our needs.  In the words of my kids, \"\"I never want leave here.\"\"\""
7161203,57005051,2015-12-21,37782100,Christian,"Huggy is a really nice and friendly. He provided full bedding and some kitchen equipment when I arrived. When I left, he gave me a lift to the train station. He really tries to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. There was no kitchen table when I arrived, Huggy quickly organized one after we asked for one."
The place itself is mostly quiet because everyone is running on very different schedules. The price for the room was cheap compared to other offers and even though the area is not very popular,I never had any trouble.,,,,
To reach the city,as there is no T-station around,you need to take a bus. Even though,there is no schedule for the busses,I never had to wait longer than 15min because there are 3 lines running in the same direction.,
One thing you need to know is that there is no laundry facitilites in the house. The get to the next laundry you need to take a bus which takes about 10 minutes. If you plan to stay longer,you should consider that it takes some time to get your laundry done.,,,,
"Except from that I can clearly recommend the place. \"",,,,,
7161203,59622657,2016-01-12,14272623,Carlos Eduardo,Location : Nearest bus stop was less than 2-minute walk and was served by many different bus lines. Buses usually came right away and the longest I waited was five minutes. I had to visit many different parts of Boston and Cambridge and the public transportation was very convenient.
House : It was very well-maintained and clean house. Grocery and basic shopping were across the street. The only catch was that there were no washer and drier in the house. Two laundromats were within walking distance (or better yet,for free dryers,a few bus stops away).,,,
People : My roommates were university academics or in the medical field. They were courteous and traveled often and the apartment was quiet. The neighborhood was diverse and safe. Neighbors were friendly. The host was very accommodating.,,,,,
"Overall: Clean house with easy commute to downtown\"",,,,,

Plenty of amenities close by in the neighborhood including groceries and laundry. The apartment was a great bang for your buck and included everything I needed for my month-long stay. Huggy was an excellent and kind host and was frequently in contact with me throughout my stay (as well as before and after) to make sure I had a positive experience.  I HIGHLY recommend this listing to anyone looking for a place to stay in Boston."

5506,18678,2009-11-29,51993,Sarah,"We stayed in the private room.  Terry provided a mini fridge and microwave, bath products, guidebooks, soft sheets and fluffy towels.  We were very cozy despite it being a blustery winter weekend.  Downtown Boston was visible from our room on the 3rd floor and, though the T was nearby, we enjoyed walking into town.  What a good value-- we'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
5506,24467,2010-01-19,68674,LaJuan,Stayed here recently during a conference and the accomodations were fantastic!  Terry is very laid back  and very hospitable.  The location is great.  I used mass transit most of the time and the conference sites I visited were very accessible.  I would highly recommend this experience as an alternative to an overpriced hotel.
5506,25958,2010-02-13,47993,Juan Carlos,"My partner and I stayed for a week at Terry's during our vacation and it was a great experience.  We were happy with our decision to stay there.  The space is comfortable; we were able to relax.  The room is very close to the train, so it was easy to hop on the train and get around Boston and come back to our room whenever we wanted.  We felt welcomed, safe, and comfortable.  I would recommend it without hesitations."

The location was good, close to the train, and the place itself was beautiful, clean and just what we needed for our weekend away. We stayed in a smaller room the first night and then moved to a larger room after. It was nice to have the extra space and full kitchen. Although we did not see our host, we had plenty of communication via message as well as many things left for us in the room. Would definitely recommend."
5506,46494,2010-05-26,95028,Lois,"Stayed over Terry’s place back in May, and we were very happy about the room.  Terry is a very friendly and informative guy, and very quick in replying emails.  He got maps, attraction spots and restaurant tips all planned out ready to pick up in the room, and he takes his time to explain to us where we were, and how to get to one point to another. The room we stayed was very charming and clean.  It has everything you need, and we loved the bathroom.  It is only minutes away from the subway station and bus stops, and takes only 10 to 15 minutes to go everywhere. Thanks a lot, Terry!  We had a good time."

The house has a heap of character and my room was a lot better than I had first expected.  The bedroom was big,the shower had a tonne of pressure,and the bed was super comfy. I got an awesome nights sleep before having to fly half way around the world.,,,

The place is really easy to get to on public transportation and Terry's directions were perfect. It's a quiet neighbourhood so if you're looking to be right in the middle of things, you might want to stay closer to the city centre. But if you're looking for a quiet place to stay with easy access to everything via the T, this is a great spot. Thanks Terry!"

He sets the bar high on all fronts: beautifully decorated, clean, spacious, comfortable, affordable & full of amenities.  Easy communication & check-in/out. Great location, lovely neighborhood & FREE street parking (practically in front of the place). The 1st 2 nights I stayed at the 2 bedroom duplex apartment. My first night was at the tail end of a heat wave (it was 88 degrees out) but Terry's place was perfectly cool & comfortable. The a/c was on when I got there, with a few lights & low background music making it very welcoming. The 3rd night I was in the Private Room & Bath  which was also very lovely. It was well-equipped, and great to have the microwave and mini-fridge (there's plates/silverware and just about anything you could need in the cabinet). I slept well on the very comfy beds at both places. Glad I got to meet Terry as I was leaving:)... (though he had been available & we communicated through text during my stay). Would highly recommend & stay again, Thanks Terry!"

I appreciated the air conditioning on two of my three nights there, as the humidity was pretty high for the first few days of my visit. The well equipped kitchenette in the corner of the room came in handy too. I really enjoy staying in residential neighborhoods, rather than at big downtown chain hotels. This was ideal for me. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a notebook with information about local restaurants and things to see. I didn't make use of that as I was here for a workshop, but it was a nice touch. A very charming place to stay. I'd stay there again next time I have to be in the Longwood Medical area."

La cama se apoya en esa pared y está separado solo por una puerta, lo que significa continuamente hay ruido, especialmente molesto cuando cada cierto tiempo arranca el motor y se activa el funcionamiento de la caldera.

Her cat is equally delightful, and made sure to take his place as \"\"host\"\" the one evening that Maggie arrived home later than I did."
The location was very convenient to the Boston Convention and Exhibit Center - an easy 15-20 minute walk. The route has a few dark places,and Athens street itself is quite dark,and finding Maggie's place itself was a bit of challenge in the dark. Nonetheless,"I didn't particularly feel unsafe walking solo as a small female. The walk was better lit to the theater district/Union and Washington street areas and there were plenty of couples of all ages out and about in the 8-9pm time even though it was dark by then when I visited.\"",,

Her place was clean and comfortable,the bed was comfy,and the room was large enough that I could relax and get caught up on emails in the evening. It was also close to some bars,markets,and restaurants,and the metro station was just a few blocks away.
The only challenge I had during my stay was that I rented a car for two days to do some sightseeing and found parking to be really difficult (which Maggie warned me about) as there are no parking spaces for the apartment...but other than that,"my stay was great and I would definitely recommend Maggie's place and would stay there again if I'm back in the area.\"",,,,
3585343,67596558,2016-03-30,32671213,Natalie,"Maggie was a great host!! Directions were clear when I first got there, no complications, and everything was exactly how described. The place was clean and spacious for my friend and I. Maggie was a very sweet and was able to accommodate us with anything we needed. She even let me stay an additional day because my flight was scheduled to leave the next day. Overall I really enjoyed her place and would definitely stay there again! :)"
3585343,68352220,2016-04-04,50157174,Monica,Host was nice and accomodating. Location was super close to Convention Center and made it very easy for visiting the city.
3585343,69628849,2016-04-12,6044090,Jill,"Maggie wasn't there when we stayed, but she was welcoming via text message. It was a great location to stay in to see some of Boston's strong sense of community as well as some of the newer areas developing with good food nearby and great subway accessibility. The room we stayed in was not the room pictured in the description, but it wasn't too terribly different - maybe just a result of rearranging or redecorating."
3585343,71474794,2016-04-25,23734896,Brigette,"Lovely apartment, was a great location for attending a conference at the Boston Convention center. Maggie was a great host and made it very convenient and easy to come and go as we pleased. Very much enjoyed our stay!"

3585343,77191290,2016-05-30,29062453,Tommy,"My girlfriend and I had a very pleasant stay here for Memorial Day Weekend. The room was neat and cozy. Although Maggie was not available to be at the apartment when we checked in, she arranged a way for us to get access into the place. Also, her cat was friendly and welcomed us into our room as we entered. The apartment was walking distance to the T red line station, as well 7 min Uber to Harpoon Brewery. Overall, good and quiet place to stay with convenient access to public transportation. Recommended."
3585343,78411094,2016-06-06,42313883,Emily,"Maggie was a great host, very accommodating and helpful. The room was nice and great to stay in for the weekend. The apartment was conveniently located near the T station and a short walk from the convention center."
3585343,79414812,2016-06-12,72779637,Lorraine,"Maggie was very courteous and friendly. Her pets were very friendly and playful. The room was very simple, but not too small. We had free use of things around the house. Definitely worth staying there again."

Although we didn't get to meet Maggie due to our timings, she made arrangements for us to collect the keys etc. She has a very friendly cat and dog also ! The location is perfect for getting around Boston. Great communication. We really enjoyed our stay. Thanks Maggie :)"
3585343,83623558,2016-07-03,70379390,Kevin,Maggie was a wonderful host!
Her dog and cat were pleasant and lovely companions when she was out.,,,,,
The apartment was a great size and in an awesome location near the waterfront.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3585343,84822874,2016-07-09,79831753,Archana,We thought we had booked for BNB; Bed and breakfast. But breakfast was not provided on both days and Maggie was very clear about it. So it should have been made clear and stated clearly before we made the final booking.
It was very hot and there was no AC in the room,not even a ceiling fan. it had only a pedestal fan. On our insistence,she shifted the drawing room AC in the bed room. it was very disappointing.,,,
"We definitely felt cheated and very bad about it. \"",,,,,
3585343,86525140,2016-07-16,7448616,Cesar,I was at a conference in at the BCEC and  this location was very convenient.  Close to the metro station and several places to eat. Maggie was helpful and kind. Her dog and cat are friendly.

we spent 2 night there and everything was perfect.,,,,,
The house is well located,you can reach downtown using underground (5 min) or walking (20 min),,,,
"great experience! thanks Maggie\"",,,,,
3585343,93967671,2016-08-14,26637416,Martin,Nice apartment in a nice Boston neighborhood. Close to a lot of places. Maggie was a very open and helpful host.
3585343,96743886,2016-08-24,74004616,Maurice,"You really couldn't ask for a nicer host or apartment.  I spent 5 days and really could not fault Maggie's hospitality or the location of her apartment.  As she said herself, her cat Shebley, owns the place and is simply the cutest thing on 4 legs.  And Charlie (hope I've spelt those names correctly Maggie) her dog is so eager to play I felt I was in a Garfield/Odie cartoon sometimes (and yes, they do chase each other and skid out of control into the (URL HIDDEN) funny to watch)."
In terms of location the apartment is a couple of mins walk (2 small blocks) from a metro station and in between are several nice looking bars,a small diner (not used as I bought breakfast stuff from the nearby supermarket) and  a couple of coffee shops/sandwich shops.,,,,
Thank you Maggie for making my stay in Boston so comfortable.,,,,,

3585343,97229388,2016-08-26,66396569,其融,"The room is neat and comfortable. A subway station, a few grocery stores and restaurants are within walking distance."

John has a very nice place in a fantastic location,"I walked to most places or took the public transport system from southbay. I can only recommend it :)\"",,,,
1948096,47286366,2015-09-17,2293315,Patrick,"John has a wonderful home in the perfect area in Boston.  The beautiful greenbelt in back led us to the most desirable parts of downtown Boston, all within walking distance of historical sights, or transportation anywhere.  We loved it and would highly recommend it."
1948096,48919694,2015-09-29,37168362,Jennifer,"This duplex was in a perfect location for our trip.  Getting the keys was seemless , even with my late night arrival. I went with my friends who had a 1 year old with them.  Initially the host was concerned about the stairs, but we had no problem blocking them with chairs, etc to make it child safe.  The neighborhood was super child friendly with a playground in the park out back and a walking trail nearby without any car traffic.  I was there for MIT business and it was a straight 45 min walk to campus on mass ave.  I could have caught the #1 bus to make it shorter but the weather was so stunning in late September I preferred the walk."
I think there are only a couple of things I was not expecting of this place: 1) it was bare of all condiments,etc in the kitchen.  This was my first airbnb experience but from what my friends told me there are usually basics like sugar,salt,and pepper.  I left those behind after my stay in hopes that the next guests could use them.  2) we accidentally damaged the wall with our stroller while we were there.  We knew we had to pay the damages,but the price we were charged was a bit more expensive than we were expecting.  I suppose that is just the liability associated with staying at an airbnb vs a hotel.  In the end it was worth it to be able to stay with my friends in the same place and have the comfort of home.,
We will be back in Boston in June for our reunion and I hope to be able to stay here again.  This time I will have my family as well,"so will need to negotiate to see if we can have that many people in the 2 bedroom.  Coming from Cali we are used to small places and having stayed there I would have no concerns about sharing this space for two families since our children are very small and co-sleep usually.  Thanks for the stay and the lovely location and hope to be back soon.\"",,,,
6445917,39872929,2015-07-26,38715707,Kelly,"Lia was extremely accommodating and easy to communicate with- she responded to all of my questions/comments within the day, usually within a couple of hours. For my first time using Airbnb, I found the perfect hostess! My boyfriend and I found the space cozy, as it was well equipped with a TV, full kitchenette to make pancakes, and such a dreamy bed. The best part was the Beacon Hill neighborhood, which was quite charming ; we felt safe and it was a quick walk to the Boston Commons and Park Street T-stop, so we had Boston at our fingertips. Overall, a great choice!"
6445917,41852214,2015-08-09,39768217,Roberta,We had an amazing time here. The apartment was great and the location couldn't be better. Lia was fast to respond to any questions we had. If we ever go back to Boston I would definitely stay there again!
6445917,44021768,2015-08-23,22897693,Katie,Lia was an incredible host! Her apartment is in the perfect location to explore Boston! It's an easy walk to most places or a very short uber ride of you don't feel like walking. There are tons of cute places around her apartment to eat and shop! She answered all our questions very quickly and even gave us some recommendations before our weekend! She provided us with all the essentials we needed for a great weekend.
6445917,46031476,2015-09-07,38399332,Alexandra,"Lia nous a fourni des renseignements sur la ville, sur notre arrivée et notre départ, des choix d'activités et elle était toujours disponible pour nos questions."

6445917,47492608,2015-09-19,35856512,Benjamin,"My wife and I did a whirlwind trip to Boston for my wife's bday and had a fantastic time! In part to Lia, she was amazing to work with. Fast to respond to inquiries and flexible with her times to allow us to drop our bags and explore the city right away. Her apt is wonderful,  perfectly located, and has one of the best beds to come back to after walking all day. Highly recommended, if we go back to Boston we will definitely see if Lia's place is available."
6445917,47799627,2015-09-21,17344353,Kristen,We had a great stay in Beacon Hill.  Lia's studio is in a prime location in Boston.  You are a 10 minute walk from Quincy Market and a couple of blocks from the red line. Lia's place has everything you need.  She was very flexible and quick to respond to any questions.  I would definitely stay here again.
6445917,48564265,2015-09-27,42639028,Abby,"My husband and I LOVED our experience at Lia's apartment. It was clean, organized, and comfortable. We were within walking distance of everything in Boston, and the Beacon Hill area is absolutely charming! Lia was such a thoughtful host! She mailed our keys to us and included pages of tips and places of interest in Boston. We will certainly contact her again if we are fortunate enough to return to Boston!"
6445917,49467800,2015-10-04,42519950,Klaas,"From all things great in Boston, this place was probably the best thing of my trip! A comfortable studio in a relaxed neighbourhood; the perfect spot to venture out into the city and come ‘home’ to afterwards. Everything was as advertised and Lia was helpful and quick to respond. The studio is greatly situated, close to restaurants, bars and shops in Beacon Hill, and if needed the subway, but I mainly walked when staying within Boston (park, Faneuil Hall, Esplanade, Back Bay East). Would definitely stay there again!"
6445917,50326955,2015-10-11,43893138,David,"Great apartment in the heart of Beacon Hill. We enjoyed the neighborhood all close to the shops and restaurants on Charles Street. Lia, our host, was wonderful and answered our questions promptly. My wife and I would certainly stay at Lia's place again."

6445917,69266822,2016-04-10,60116012,Kate,"\"We had a great stay in Boston and in Lia's humble abode! The apartment is small, but had everything we needed. Beacon Hill is a very unique and historic area. My husband and I enjoyed walking through the neighborhood. The apartment is close to everything. It is about a 15 minute walk to North End and a 30 minute walk to the harbor. I recommend either not bringing a car or preparing to pay $90 for parking. There are a few visitor spots on the streets but they were really difficult to find on the weekend--maybe week days are easier.  Another thing to be prepared for is a steep hike up 6 or so small flights of stairs to get to Lia's apartment.  We really enjoyed meeting Frank, Lia's \"\"pet\"\" penguin waiting in the chill of the fridge"
6445917,70249058,2016-04-17,60047853,Jonathan,"Lia was an excellent host! She made the process of checking in effortless. Her apartment was clean, warm, and welcoming, and the location right in the heart of Beacon Hill really can't be beat."

The apartment had everything you need. Not many cars on the road and no bars nearby so you can leave the windows up at night and sleep fine! Warning: If you are older and don't like stairs this is not the place for you!
6445917,78253547,2016-06-06,16668301,Opus,"Great, beautiful place in the most picturesque neighborhood in Boston."

10113230,67460994,2016-03-29,38421685,Crystal,"Ashlee was very accommodating! She allowed us to come early despite the short notice. We had to bring an extra towel because she didn't have time to wash enough towels. The house is nice and the locafion is perfect, it was like 3 blocks away from anime Boston and we just walked there. The food and stores are right next door too! Convenient! The heating was nice and warm too. Thank you!"
10113230,70569247,2016-04-18,32043070,Kate,"Ashlee was a great host and was incredibly flexible. The room was spacious and the building itself was quiet, which was great. The room overlooks 90 and the noise of cars/trucks could be a little hard to ignore. The location is amazing otherwise and was exactly what I was looking for."
10113230,72092167,2016-05-01,66655936,Priyesh,Ashlee is pleasant and well mannered . Everything was as per description . Neighbourhood is safe and nearby subway train and bus stop and shopoing area.

The apartment is in the heart of Boston, so the traffic was a bit too noisy... The air mattress was not very comfortable. Ashlee was so kind that she even allowed us to leave our stuff in her room until we were ready to check out!"

10113230,74366571,2016-05-15,56270659,Lina,Ashlee was very accommodating even though my family arrived late at night. She was also helpful and responded quickly to any questions I had. Her place was also conveniently located right next to the T stop. The room was nice and clean.
10113230,75070553,2016-05-18,69450950,Jim,"Ashley is nice, accommodating and communicative. Her room is walking distance to everywhere in Boston, which is kind of nice."

10113230,76268330,2016-05-26,56536705,Andrew,"Loved the time I stayed at Ashlee's.  It's really close to Fenway, the main bus drop off from the airport and walking distance to other great areas to spend time in.  Ashlee's place was clean and she was super friendly."
10113230,76586707,2016-05-28,34790140,E.J.,"Nice little spot to crash at in Back Bay! Ashlee's place is a short stroll from the many shops, eateries, and bars in the area and a couple blocks from Fenway, if that's your jam. There's also a Hubway bike rental stand and T station nearby if you want to extend your range. I stayed with two other friends (three total) and we had no issues at all. Yes, there's some noise from the cars travelling down Hwy 90 below the apartment. Though it was more like white noise to us, almost soothing (maybe we're weird...). Ashlee was very welcoming and we enjoyed staying at her place for the night we were there."
10113230,77789188,2016-06-03,65214653,Megan,Ashlee was very accommodating when I checked in and checked out (very helpful!). She was welcoming and chatted with me right away to make sure I had everything I needed and to answer any questions. The room and bathroom were very clean. I was never disturbed and was always able to use the restroom at my leisure. She also checked to make sure it wasn't too loud in the apartment for me as she knew I was in Boston for a work conference. The location is perfect for attending a conference at the Hynes Convention Center and close to public transportation. I would definitely stay here again if I am visiting Boston!
10113230,78205604,2016-06-05,2440411,Hiba,"Was attending a wedding in Boston with a friend, and couldn't have asked for a better location to both get where I needed to go and see the city - very central and close to T and bus stops, and walking distance from most things worth seeing in Boston and Cambridge.  There's an awesome ice cream place and many restaurants right across the street. Ashlee was a great host - very accessible, responsive, and flexible with timings of check in/out. The room was as described, large with a comfy bed, AC, desk, etc. Ashlee provided clean towels and sheets.  Overall, great host, great stay, and highly recommended!"

10113230,80113050,2016-06-16,76594722,Dylan,"I had an enjoyable stay. Host was very responsive and helpful. Was able to add a guest to my reservation easily. Good location, wifi was easy, bed was comfy. Only criticisms would be cleanliness and privacy. The room and bathroom could've been a little cleaner and the door didn't have a handle or lock on it. Other than that, it was all positive."
10113230,80228277,2016-06-17,73661504,Derek,Ashlee was very helpful and communicative throughout the process. She even offered for us to sleep in her room an extra night bc we were staying overnight in the airport for the last night. She also allowed us to leave our luggage in her place while  we caught another Red Sox game even though it was very last minute. She made our experience all the better. Thanks Ashlee!
10113230,80389310,2016-06-18,73861679,Tiffany,Ashlee was very flexible with our check in time- which was awesome! She also checked in periodically to make sure everything was going smoothly! Great place for what we needed! Thanks!

The apartment has a good location: near the tube station, near the city center and surrounded by a lot of shops and resturants/cafè. The room was very confortable and exactly as described. But... the future guest need to be prepared to some \"\"details\"\". 1) the noise from the highway below! A real nigthmare even if the apt is at the 4th floor. 2) any handle in bedroom door. 3) any curtain in bathroom window! And you need to consider that the shower is exactly in front of the window. 4) the bathroom was a little bit messy and not so clean. 5) the door at the entrance of building was broken and anyone can enter using a card and simply insert it into the lock!\""
10113230,81945005,2016-06-25,12243636,Eunice,"Very convenient location to the Hynes Convention Center, took 10 minutes to walk with a suitcase through a pleasant part of town. Also the bedroom really is very large!"
10113230,85335704,2016-07-11,38946479,Alexandra,"Ashlee was super sweet and very flexible with our check in time since we were running late.

She was not home for the weekend, but provided all the necessary instructions for obtaining the key and entering the building.  She was very responsive to any questions that I had.  The room was just as described and perfect for our needs.  We were in town for concerts at Fenway and just needed a room to crash for two days.  The location was perfect and the room was plenty large enough for 3 people.  The apartment building was well maintained and I felt secure."
10113230,87889848,2016-07-22,73794707,Zhe,Ashley is very nice and kind!
10113230,89006216,2016-07-26,9201709,Nicolas,Ashlee a tout fait pour nous accueillir au mieux alors qu'elle déménageait et qu'elle était déjà partie en tournée.
Tout le séjour c'est bien passé mais entrer dans un appartement presque vidé sans être prévenu était un peu étrange.,,,,,
Le logement était propre mais sans plus.,,,,,
"Très bien placé è\"",,,,,
10113230,90385405,2016-08-01,60678282,May,"Nice simple, yet spacious room. Clear instruction with all amenities including wireless internet and AC. Ashlee was very responsive to questions via text message and provided clear instruction for key pickup and drop-off. Highly recommended."
10113230,91135525,2016-08-04,77525044,Josefine,"I was in Boston for only a few days, and just needed a place to put my stuff and sleep. I texted Ashley a few days before arriving to get information about keys and stuff, but she didn't get back to me until I called her when I arrived at the airport. Stress me a bit. She told me she had moved out so the apartment wouldn't look like the pictures, but she didn't want to cancel my booking because of that. Since I needed a place to stay, I accepted it. When I arrived the only thing left in the room was the bed and a desk. I didn't need anything else, but it made the room a bit uncharmning and 'cold'. All the dirt, hair ect. was swiped in the corner of the room and the bathroom wasn't really clean either. Unfortunately. On my second day I was taking a nap, when suddenly it knocks very brutal on my door. I asked who it was, and a girl and boy told me they where at the apartment to take pictures and look around because they where thinking about renting it. I let them in, but felt uncomfortable knowing people would come by anytime. I would have liked to know in advance. When I left the apartment I didn't got any information about where to put the keys, so I decided just to leave them the same place, as a found them. Even though Ashlee told me just to call if I needed anything and she sounded really sweet at the phone, I felt like she didn't cared about the room she was renting out. But the room provided me with a good bed, a shower and a perfect location which was all I really needed."
10113230,91512316,2016-08-05,20994224,Anna,"Ashley is very nice and easy to communicate with. I didn't meet her as she doesn't live there anymore. Location was perfect, I could walk everywhere. Only criticism would be cleanliness and privacy, bathroom hasn't been cleaned properly for a long time. Future guests should also be aware that its extremly noisy from the higway and it may interrupt your sleep."
10113230,91723407,2016-08-06,70655775,Shaun,"I came from NJ to see Pearl Jam at Fenway Park. Ashlee's apt was less than 10 mins on foot from Fenway. In addition, the location of her apt is surrounded by everything you need at your fingertips. Ashlee was a breeze to communicate with through texting. When I left, I had an uber scoop me up to take me to the airport from Ashlee's in less than 5 mins.  All I needed was a place to lay my head after the concert. And that's exactly what I got!"
10113230,92395576,2016-08-08,85777351,Gabe,"\"Had a great stay! Room was clean and comfortable. Very convenient distance from Fenway. Communication with Ashlee was helpful and clear although we never met in person she seemed very nice. Special thanks also to her friend who helped get us \"\"checked in\"\".\""
10113230,93233081,2016-08-12,76352493,Christina,"Great Location.  Minutes from Fenway. I would have hoped the place was a bit cleaner though. The pictures definitely make the place look more appealing than it actually is. Ashley was really nice. She let us check in earlier than what was listed, which helped us a lot. It was unclear if or when the next guests were coming so we weren't sure when to give the keys back, but by coincidence we were walking out the door on our last day to get lunch and there were 3 people trying to figure out how to get in. We asked what address they were looking for and it was the place we rented so we let them in the building, gave them the key and directed them to text Kayla to get clean towels and sheets, etc. Overall, the best part of this place was the Location."
10113230,93980136,2016-08-14,41320614,Peter,Ashlee was very friendly and helpful. She provided detailed instructions that made check in and check out very easy. The room was clean and air conditioned when I arrived. The space itself was nothing special but got the job done at a great price for the area.
10113230,96161979,2016-08-22,73354403,Anna,"We were 3 to stay at Ashlee's place for 5 nights. The neighborhood is amazing, there's a lot of restaurants and place to shop as she told us. She always responded quickly to our questions and made us feel comfortable. Only downside was that she didn't tell us that the place will be empty because she's moving so it was a bit surprising. But we had an excellent stay and enjoyed our time in Boston !"
9331460,55735274,2015-12-05,48898213,Goran,"The bedroom was very nice and spacious, as described. Sanchit was very relaxed and easy-going. The building and the neighbourhood seemed quiet, and within a walking distance to central areas. Overall, it was a nice stay."
9331460,56393034,2015-12-13,26549993,Vincent,I had a great stay with sanchit
6409811,33331068,2015-05-26,33825447,Malcolm,"The unit was in a great location. We literally parked and walked everywhere. Parking was metered, and fortunately, we only received one ticket, as we had stayed over a holiday weekend. Parking at the meter was free after 6pm Saturday and on public holidays. The apartment itself was comfortable and inviting. Internet was provided, and the TV service was good. Overall a very good experience. This was my first time using airbnb and I would readily do so again"
6409811,33880845,2015-06-01,34403543,Adam,The apartment was a decent place for a quick stay and a lot cheaper than hotels in the area. It was clean and there were plenty of restaurants within walking distance.
6409811,34330975,2015-06-07,26819400,Michael,"Nice apartment, with quick access to Fenway Park. Great location for other attractions as well. Comfortable couch with a great TV as well. Andrew was very accommodating, and accessing the keys was quick and easy. Only thing to be aware of is the potential for noise on the weekends or during Red Sox games. You can hear all of the cars and the people down below on the street. Beyond that, I would definitely recommend the place to a friend."
6409811,34470135,2015-06-08,33696504,Tom,"Location was awesome, 5 min walk to Fenway, nice and quiet area even though your so close to that area.  The apartment was clean and in nice shape. No issues with check in, Andrew left lockbox outside. Would recommend to others and would stay there again."
6409811,35051192,2015-06-14,35595699,Jeff,"Nice, clean place extremely convenient to Fenway Park and everything else Kenmore Square has to offer. First time using Airbnb and Andrew made it easy."
6409811,36632284,2015-06-29,5172812,Miki,Andrew was a very conscientious communicator - from the reservation to the arrival. Was very helpful and at the same time could keep to himself and let us do our thing about the town.
"The apartment was convenient geographically and very accommodating by way of amenities. Definitely a positive experience. \"",,,,,
6409811,37405561,2015-07-06,4873495,Mauricio,"Our stay at Andrew's place went really smoothly. He stayed in good communication the entire time and was always really prompt at replying to any inquiries. The apartment is really nice and clean, and very conveniently located in a nice neighborhood. I would definitively recommend it to anyone visiting the city."
6409811,40038382,2015-07-27,39074308,Philip,"Andrew was courteous and prompt with responses. Checking in/out was simple. The apartment is spacious, comfortable, and clean; perfect for relaxing after a day in the city before an evening out. It is within a very short walk to many great restaurants, bars, the Esplanade, Fenway Park, and the T/bus lines that provide access to the rest of the city."
6409811,40983334,2015-08-03,25539260,Thomas,great location for a red sox game or anything to do in kenmore sq. no problems with anything all good.
6409811,42082203,2015-08-10,34756577,Kendra,Great location.... served its purpose for a night out in the city!
6409811,43098097,2015-08-17,38837912,Jack,Andrew has a great apartment in a perfect location very close to Fenway park. It was very easy to check in and he was very responsive to any questions I had. Would recommend anyone to stay at his place.
6409811,44196142,2015-08-24,40683510,Thomas,"Andrew's apartment was my first experience using AirBNB, and he made it very smooth and painless. The apartment is exactly as described and pictured in the listing, no surprises. In a great location close to Kenmore Square, Fenway Park, and the T. Andrew went out of his way to keep me informed, excellent host."
Great place to stay in the Back Bay,"and Andrew was an excellent host. \"",,,,
6409811,46148439,2015-09-08,39198967,Harrold,Very comfortable place to stay conveniently located near Kenmore Square and not too far from Cambridge and MIT
6409811,47740051,2015-09-21,23902556,Silvia,"E' stato molto facile ed efficiente comunicare con Andrew, che è sempre stato gentile, preciso e puntuale. La posizione dell'appartamento è centralissima, utile per visitare Boston al meglio. L'appartamento è adatto per 1 o al massimo due persone, è molto carino, come risulta dalle foto, solo più in disordine e non perfettamente pulito. E' chiaramente l'appartamento dove Andrew vive abitualmente, ma penso dovrebbe usare qualche accortezza quando lo affitta tramite Airbnb: p.es. la camera era piuttosto in disordine, i fornelli della cucina non erano puliti, l'acqua della vasca non scaricava bene a causa dello sporco, mancava la carta igienica, i cestini in bagno e cucina non erano svuotati.  Basta che Andrew lo prepari un po' meglio quando riceve ospiti Airbnb."
6409811,49610841,2015-10-05,8126941,Ana,"Andrew's place was pretty much as described.  Good location and big enough for two people.  Getting the keys was an easy process.  The building is a bit old and you have to walk up one flight of stairs.  Heating is run by the building so you don't have any personal control. The apartment is close to the river and it was beautiful to take a run down to that area. Andrew was communicative with us. There was a mix up and the apartment hadn't been cleaned. Andrew offered to have someone come out, but we had already cleaned. The bed was comfortable but, as it appears that Andrew uses this space for his own during the week, there is little available storage area in the bedroom."
6409811,50576402,2015-10-12,32133261,Michelle,"A nice, clean space in a great location. Andrew provided amenities like towels, TV, and wifi and responded quickly when I had questions. Would recommend."
6409811,51273296,2015-10-19,38033996,Andrew,"We were in Boston for Boston University parents weekend. A very convenient location within walking distance to campus. The apartment was as advertised and Andrew was very responsive to our questions. The only suggestion is that it would be nice to have a coffee pot, although there is a Starbucks just down the street."
6409811,51821913,2015-10-24,8871134,Amanda,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6409811,53571889,2015-11-09,4154608,Mo,Awesome unit. Very conveniently located and close to everything. The apartment itself has all you need for a pleasant stay. Andrew has been nice and answers and replies to all messages/inquiries pretty quickly.
6409811,54132071,2015-11-16,27578622,Katie,Check in was super easy. Location was very convenient and 3 min walk to T station. The apartment was clean and safe. Andrew was prompt in response time and friendly. Only downside is that the sheets were definitely used and not clean. Guess you can bring your own pillowcases.
6409811,66315278,2016-03-21,11336400,Annette,Andrew was very helpful and very responsive throughout the entire process.
6409811,70446549,2016-04-17,57999381,Keith,"Andrew made me feel welcome by responding to email promptly and providing access to the apartment with a 24 hour lock-box. The apartment was as advertised, nice neighborhood, close to everything I needed, within walking distance to many things and transportation."
6409811,72198851,2016-05-01,25652029,Matthew,"Andrew was a pleasure to stay with.  He communicated well, and gave us everything that needed.  His place was amazing, and we loved staying there.  I particularly liked all of the sports memorabilia that made it feel distinctly Boston-esque.  Thanks for hosting us!"

6409811,75792987,2016-05-23,195870,Ryan,"Host was great, super easy to get in and out of the space. It was clean, and exactly as advertised. Great neighborhood. I was in and out for a wedding and this couldn't have been more convenient."
6409811,77307511,2016-05-31,57203333,Aaron,"Good location near lots of restaurants, as well as public transit to get to the rest of the downtown area.  The unit itself was comfortable, would rent again."

6409811,80941202,2016-06-20,41253611,Jess,"My husband and I traveled to Boston for a weekend together to do a Red Sox game and other Boston attractions. This apartment was perfect for what we needed--a centrally located place, easy in and out, private, and comfortable. Andrew was very helpful and responsive in answering our questions before the trip. It had the feel of staying at a friend's apartment. Andrew makes it clear that he does live here during the week, and that is evident. His personal belongings are throughout the apartment, but this wasn't a surprise as he told us that multiple times (I actually enjoyed all the Boston sports memorabilia!). His post does state that a cleaning company comes in on Fridays. The place did not appear to be professionally cleaned, but you can tell he did tidy up and fresh sheets/towels were provided. Using the lockbox outside was easy--no problem coming or going and we even used the lockbox while we were out so we didn't have to carry keys on us! We will definitely consider staying here again--it couldn't be more perfect for a Sox game!!!!"
6409811,82291425,2016-06-27,22548363,Vineet,"It is as shown in the photos, in a great location in town. Beacon Street and Commonwealth Ave are beautiful spots to walk around. Also close to the river and Cambridge. The check-in was very smooth and the host was very flexible in letting us a late check-out. Overall great experience, just a touch pricey in our opinion but I believe it is quite fair given market rates in Boston."
6409811,84244035,2016-07-06,62842032,Michelle,"Great apartment, nice location, would do again!"
6409811,88929001,2016-07-26,33464746,Nahal,"Thank you for opening up your place to us! Great location!! Comfortable space, but air conditioning does not cool down apt and this is so necessary in Boston during the summer months! Thanks for being quick to respond during check in and flexible with checkout. Much appreciated!!"
6409811,90344032,2016-07-31,8658382,Mike,We enjoyed staying in Andrew's apartment and found it cozy and comfortable.  The TV and couch area were particularly comfortable.

6409811,92426151,2016-08-08,56663374,Timothy,Stayed here for an extended weekend. The apartment was perfect. Was in town for two concerts at Fenway Park and the location could not have been easier. It was a 3-5 minute walk to Fenway.
Check in was easy. I took the red eye and was able to check in early and relax.,,,,,
Aside from Fenway,location was great to get to other parts of the city. Even walked from back bay to the apartment.,,,,
To the previous review about A/C not powerful enough,I did not find this to be the case. It was plenty strong enough for a weekend in the high-80s.,,,,

Her place is full of colours. On the walls,with a beautiful blue floor. something special.,,,,

7114655,44028449,2015-08-23,12614949,Amanda,"\"We had a great experience in this south end loft. It was perfectly set up to accommodate a less than 1 year old: a crib, changing table, lots of awesome toys and the place itself was mostly baby-proofed. The loft was clean and had all the amenities we had hoped. One aspect that we wish we would have known prior to booking our stay was that this is a ground level loft that has giant glass doors in the front and the back. They were locked and covered with curtains, but we did feel a bit uneasy at times knowing that the place had an alarm system that was not in use and there was a \"\"panic\"\" button next to the bed. I would have had no problem using the alarm code. It is overall a nice place that we would consider again!\""

Very fun to chat with. And offered us a continental style breakfast in the morning. The location was great too. Easy to get into Boston, but Brighton is really cute itself. We world definitely recommend staying here."
4456987,32614916,2015-05-19,21819432,Ali,Valerie and Bala were very welcoming. I'd recommend this place if you are visiting BC (20min walk).
4456987,33184333,2015-05-25,33239413,Krystal,"We enjoyed our stay at Valerie's. She happened to be out of town so we did not meet her. She did leave us directions to the bus stop and passes to the aquarium. Which was great. We didn't explore the neighborhood but seemed very cute, quite and safe. Getting into the city was easy but did take a good 25-30 minutes on the bus. Valerie was kind enough to leave us a few breakfast items in the fridge which was nice. We also had access to the washer and dryer which was a plus."

The room was really nice,clean,and spacious,as was the bathroom,and the whole house was lovely (+ the hammock out back was the best!),
They were super helpful (gave me a bike lock for my bike when I forgot one!)  and could not have been more accommodating.  I accidentally locked myself out of my bedroom (twice!) and they were so gracious about it.,,,,,

Valerie and Bala were available and kind to answer all of our questions at all times, and even recommended us restaurants and shopping places around the area! Both the bedroom and the bathroom were very big and confortable to have our own space. The place is just a bus drive  to the city, which made it easier to move around. We enjoyed out nights watching Netflix in their living room and the breakfast they bought for us for the first days!"

It lasted only until my husband and I actually met Valerie and Bala on the first day. They truly are sweet and great people and Valerie was very honest in everything in her ad (specially regarding Kaya, the fluffiest dog you've ever seen. She is. Even though she is a large dog, she is so calm that sometimes you don't realize she is there). The neighborhood (which is very well located near public transportantion that works perfectly!) is quiet and the room and entire house are nice, clean and comfortable."

Although if we wanted more alone time they would have obliged but we enjoyed hanging out with them and talking about the area! My husband was attending a class at BU which was an easy 20 minute bus ride. Their home was conveniently located for our needs. The area has lots of great restaurants with cheap eats! The home was exactly as described.

La chambre et la salle de bain privée (qui étaient d'ailleurs très propres) se trouvent au dernier étage de la maison, ce qui permet d'avoir une certaine intimité et en plus une chouette vue sur la ville. La maison est bien située, dans un quartier sympa à partir duquel il est possible de tout faire à pied."
We had a great stay with Faye and her husband in Boston . Faye is a great host,very welcoming and she gave us a lot of good advice about her city.

Faye was very prompt in all our communications and was helpful in accommodating the timing of our arrival.  Their home is beautiful and the neighborhood felt very safe.  The third-floor AirBnB space is not large but quite comfortable for 1 or 2 people and very clean.  We appreciated their hospitable touches and recommendations on exploring the Boston area.,,,,,
We had never been in Boston before and did not have a car during our time there so easy transportation access was important to us,and this was a perfect location.  Getting to and from downtown Boston was an easy walk to the orange T subway line.  They grey line was also just down the street and around the corner which we took to get to/from the airport.,,,,

6134013,55203769,2015-11-29,5136619,Alexander,"Faye's place was exactly what I was looking for after a long flight and 2 night stopover in Boston. She and her husband greeted me like an old friend, warmly welcoming me and providing some recommendations for where to eat. You have the whole top floor to yourself, so it's just like a hotel, only homelier! Their home is also in a fantastic and scenic area, a 2 minute walk away from nice restaurants and cafes. I would definitely stay here again - Faye's home is precisely what I hope for when I use Airbnb. Thanks Faye!"
6134013,55829757,2015-12-06,17871855,Sarah,I had an amazing time staying at Faye's and Matt's house. The pictures were extremely accurate. I showed up late but Faye was at her home to greet me and show me the space. The place was clean and decorated really nicely. I felt like I was staying with family rather than a hotel.
Faye gave some great suggestions on things to do and places to eat. I was out and exploring the town most of the time but she was wonderful and so helpful if I needed anything from her. She was really sweet and chatted with me when I was around. And if I wanted privacy in my room Faye and Matt let me be. I had an amazing time and am glad I didn't stay at a hotel. If I return to Boston I will make sure to rent from her again.,,,,,
P.S. I'm slightly allergic to cats but I still love them and pet them. I had no problems with Mouse their cat. Super sweet,curious,"friendly.  The place is so clean I had no issues with cat dander.\"",,,
6134013,56613783,2015-12-15,263435,Rex,"I've stayed in about 20 AirBnB places, & Faye's place was definitely one of my favorites.  Great old brownstone in a beautiful, historic neighborhood, an easy 10 minute walk to the T (Back Bay station).  Your own 'suite' (BR & bath) on the 3rd floor.  Super comfortable bed, clean room & bath...just well thought out.  Faye was very flexible on my arrival time - which changed more than once - & a great host."

6134013,69432571,2016-04-11,55967282,Martin,Staying with Faye and Matt was fantastic.  You have the entire floor to yourself yet you still feel like you are staying at home.  The location is superb.  Train stations and bus stops are nearby but we chose to walk everywhere.  You are less than 30 minutes to both north end / city Centre and fenway park in the other direction.  There are cool little bars and cafes nearby.  The area is also extremely safe.  We walked home late at night each night and never felt uncomfortable whatsoever.  We highly recommend staying with Faye and Matt if you are travelling to Boston.
6134013,70700899,2016-04-19,29389925,Barry,Faye & Matt made my Boston marathon experience perfect. They greeted me on arrival...and after I'd finished the marathon. And that bottle of beer they gave me was just.... nectar!
Everything about 2 Ringgold Street in South End met & exceeded my expectations.,,,,,
Central Boston was within walking distance (tho'  the T was very close) even after finishing the marathon. And South End has a real community feeling about it.,,,,,
If I qualify again for the Boston marathon,I'll be back.,,,,

From the door to the North Station subway platform is a 10 minute walk at most. It is also easy to get a cab. Great value!"
Cons: The place heats up fast with the windows closed and the A/C is rather lacking. I would be leery of staying here in hot weather. Only one key. It could use some more towels and some more towel racks in the bathroom. Others mentioned street noise. There is some,but I find it soothing in a big city. The furniture is just as it appears in the pictures. It is nice,but definitely rather uncommon. I don't think it would be comfortable for a large person.,,,

The location works well particularly if you have business in downtown Boston or Cambridge MIT area. The apartment has a lot of character with lots of accessories and decoration. Most importantly, it's a clean and comfortable place with a kind host - I'd recommend staying there."
973695,17232107,2014-08-09,18572782,Josée,"Caroline was very kindly and helpful. The apartement was perfect, secure, with a beautiful cultural touch in the decoration.  I recommend the place for all. A central spot to visit Boston for a court or a long stay. Thanks again!"
973695,17566988,2014-08-14,1891446,Francis,C'était notre treizieme voyage avec Airbnb et nous avons été magnifiquement surpris. L'appartement est situé dans un très beau quartier de Boston et dans un merveilleux immeuble. Il est très confortable et très bien équipé. L'accueil a été parfait et nous conservons l'adresse pour un futur séjour à Boston.
Il est si parfaitement situé que nous avons visité la ville à pied chaque jour. Whole Food et de nombreux restaurants savoureux dans le quartier.,,,,,
Tout simplement parfait...!,,,,,
This was our thirteenth trip with Airbnb and we were wonderfully surprised. The apartment is located in a beautiful neighborhood in Boston and in a wonderful building. It is very comfortable and very well equipped. The reception was perfect and we keep the address for a future stay in Boston.,,,,,
It is so perfectly located that we visited the city on foot every day. Whole Foods and many tasty restaurants in the neighborhood.,,,,,
"Just perfect ...!\"",,,,,
973695,19574389,2014-09-14,17032634,Darius,We were very happy with the rental. It was in a great location close to a metro and easy access to all major highways. We were running a bit late as we got stuck in traffic leaving NYC but Caroline made sure we were situated. The apartment was exactly as described; clean and stock full of interesting pieces of art. Just make note you'll have to pay for parking.
973695,19823613,2014-09-19,13831243,Nick,"Caroline was the perfect host, very good communications and quick and easy to contact if you have any questions or issues.  She provided multiple points of contact so we felt comfortable everything would work smoothly even though we were arriving from overseas and had never visited Boston before."
If you’re arriving by air the apartment is a short $30 taxi ride or,if you’re game and don’t have too much luggage,for a couple of bucks you could catch the Blue line to Bowdoin station and then have just a five minute walk.,,,
The apartment is very clean and spacious and ideally located with most sights in walking distance or an easy ride on public transport.,,,,,
There is secure access manned 24 hours and an on-site laundry.,,,,,
Guests are encouraged to treat the apartment as their home with free use of cooking ingredients and even full use of the telephone. There is an excellent Whole Foods Market just around the corner if you want to self-cater.,,,,,
The only issue we had was that the bed,like in so many apartment residences,is set hard up against a wall on one side which makes access a bit awkward for us older couples!!,,,
As some other guests have mentioned – the shower is great!!,,,,,
Highly recommended.,,,,,

973695,20487273,2014-09-30,1292009,Doris & Matt,"\"We had a wonderful stay in this very comfortable and spacious apt. in a truly \"\"ideal\"\" location!  The apt. is very close and within a short walk to the North Station subway system.  It is close enough to walk to several of the stops on the Freedom Trail.  We were in a great building with 24 hour security on hand.  The kitchen in the apt. had everything we needed to prepare meals.  The apt. is exceptionally clean and decorated with lots of amazing art from around the world."
"Caroline was an exceptional host.  She was very prompt in responding to  our questions concerning the apt.  She was very helpful and very informative.  We will most certainly return and stay here again when we come back to continue our exploration of Boston!!  :)\"",,,,,
973695,20923090,2014-10-07,3688989,Lucy,"I felt very welcome in the apartment, which was clean and just as the pictures depicted. I can confirm that the shower is great! The location was fantastic-very central and very easy access to all public transportation."
973695,21020703,2014-10-09,5447288,Sheresa,"This apartment was great-- clean, spacious, beautifully furnished, and in a perfect location. I booked with Carol only a couple days before my visit, and she was prompt in her response and in setting up my stay. I would definitely stay there again next time I visit Boston!"
973695,21427592,2014-10-17,14547557,Olivia,"A clean, spacious apartment in a great location. As first timers in Boston we were ideally positioned to make the most of our few days in the city. The apartment is quiet, spotless and in a lovely building. And the Netflix subscription was a bonus!"
"Carol was really helpful and always available via email to answer our questions. I would recommend this apartment. \"",,,,,
973695,21533172,2014-10-19,21705116,Kate,Carol was extremely attentive and prompt in all our dealings with her.  We couldn't make the check in time and she made arrangements so that someone could physically be there to hand us the keys and show us around.  It was very helpful.  The neighborhood was great.  The apartment faces the intersection of a couple busy streets so it was a bit loud but the only reason we thought so was because it was warm and we left the windows open.
973695,22313413,2014-11-03,18908574,Mehmet D.,"The apartment was lovely, Carol several times asked us if everything was ok, in general a nice experience. Location is excellent, easy to reach public transportation and a lot of important places in walking distance."
The apartment has a very nice bathroom and adequate facilities. The curious character of interior design might not be every bodies cup of tea,and makes the living loom a little bit cluttered. Still,"in general me and my family had great time.\"",,,
973695,22493340,2014-11-08,22247617,Ellie,"Carol is a very helpful and accommodating host. She let us drop our bags before the 3:00pm check in time which was really appreciated. She was responsive and gave us all the contacts in case we needed them. There is a guide inside the apartment detailing nearby misc. restaurants, etc. which again was very helpful. The Apartment is very centrally located within walking distance of most tourist sites, close to Whole Foods grocery, shopping, banks, etc. It was very safe and well lit at all times. The apartment itself is very nice and there was enough storage/ space left for us to unpack our things."
There were some drawbacks: The bedroom and the kitchen were not cleaned very well even though we checked into the apartment quite late and the cleaner Olga had just been there to let us in earlier to leave our bags. There was no trash can for the wet garbage,the stove was full of pots and pans which made it inconvenient to heat up food as we did not know where to put them when we had to use the oven,so we ended up not using it. Lastly,"the bed against the wall meant that one person had to climb over the other during the night to use the rest room. So it is set up for one person only and not for two people/ couples.\"",,
973695,30129475,2015-04-18,12406857,Chao,Carol's home is very beautiful just like a small art museum. It's location is very convenient. It's about 5 minutes to North station subway and you can take the blue line from airport to Bodwin station. You can just walk from your home to the Freedom of the trail and Charlie's river.  Ms Thu is very nice and thoughtful to everything you need. She waited for us too late and showed me around the apt. Thank you very much I would recommend that definitely especially the first one coming to Boston
973695,30285687,2015-04-20,23864424,Michael,Accurately described and and fulfilled my needs for my trip to Boston.
973695,30772390,2015-04-27,24905983,Ben,"We had clear instructions on how to access our apartment, we were warmly welcomed by Olga who prepares the apartment in Carol's absence, and found our spacious, clean, modern and well located apartment as per website. Carol's art works are so numerous they fill the place but they are a very interesting extra. The sound system and library was also a bonus. We found access to everything very easy, walking to Town Common and Freedon trail etc and enjoyed the use of the kitchen and the use of the laundry facility in the building. Taxis easy to get outside on street anytime."
973695,31197743,2015-05-03,19921130,Sara,"Beautiful and clean apartment,fully equipped kitchen, and conveniently located close to North Station."
973695,31669985,2015-05-08,9871523,Phillip,"The place was perfect, Olga was on time and very nice. If you are visiting Boston, this is the place to stay."
973695,32208119,2015-05-15,15179673,James,Carol responded very quickly which greatly helped as I was booking on short notice.  She was out of town but made good arrangements with her assistant to meet me and help me get situated.
The apartment was as described.  The location is great - near metro,Beacon Hill,and the North End.,,,
I would recommend Carol as a host and the apartment as a very good central location in downtown Boston.,,,,,
"An added bonus is if the neighbor Sophia stops by.  She is a riot... full of life... made it feel like I was a long term resident of the building.\"",,,,,
973695,32679010,2015-05-20,19857397,Lidia,"Me gustó mucho la ubicación. El departamento era muy cómodo, tranquilo.lo recomiendo .lo unico que  es un poco incomodo tener la lavadora en otro piso. Lo demas es perfecto , gracias lidia"
973695,33133168,2015-05-25,8189378,Hong,"Carol responded very promptly to my request and was very thoughtful for the pre-visit emails for arrangements such as check-in time and parking space. Olga, Carol's assistant was also really nice and easy to communicate with. My friend and I had a great time while staying at this place! Carol's apartment is very accurately described and indeed beautifully decorated. It is conveniently located within 5 mins walk to the North Station, grocery stores and attractions. I would recommend it to any friend who is traveling to Boston!"
973695,34407055,2015-06-08,1172787,Heather,"I was very comfortable during my 4-day stay at Carol's apartment.  Check-in went perfectly, and Olga was most accommodating when my flight was delayed."
The apartment was very clean and comfortable,with many amenities. The kitchen had many staples available for my use.  While the apartment is very centrally located,the sirens can be noisy because of  the close proximity to the hospital and the fire station. I could not get the air conditioning to work,so had to leave the windows open to cool the apartment. I could not find the telephone (noted to be available for local calls),and my family were unable to leave a message for me (although the orientation manual for the apartment said it was set up to use).,
Despite these small shortcomings,I enjoyed my stay,"and Carol  has tried to accommodate guests well.\"",,,
973695,76452611,2016-05-27,71765128,Stuart,The apartment is very well situated and we were able to get around mostly by feet for our two week business trip. Claire was very helpful in providing information about the apartment and Boston before and during our visit. Once we had an issue with the internet and she got it quickly fixed. We ate out all the time (lots of restaurants within walking distance) but there are cooking facilities available in the apartment. The apartment block is well-kept and the people were friendly.
973695,89728343,2016-07-29,1271086,Phil,Claire was very responsive. The apartment is well located. Claire made sure I got in ok and had everything I needed.
7841193,42998554,2015-08-16,39191502,Dp,"This was a great situation for me, as the location was only a few blocks from where I needed to be at 0Dark30 the next day."
Phil was an awesome host who took care to get the a.c. in and an extra fan to keep me cool during the night--and access to excellent coffee (ha ha,needed at 4something a.m.),,,,
Also just a nice,friendly,easy going guy! Laid back but most helpful in ways I needed help.,,,
Room was very comfy in a quiet,friendly neighborhood such that I didn't feel worried about walking to my destination in the still dark morning.,,,,
Originally planned to use the Boston Hostel,"but decided to see if I could get something closer to where I wanted to be w/out the \"\"arm and a leg\"\" hotel prices--and this was a jewel of a find. Price was very reasonable--probably about the same as I'd have paid for the hostel if you consider I'd have had to get a cab/uber from the hostel.",,,,
Oh and I needed to leave my bag in the apartment,which Phil was fine with my doing--so it was in a safe place and available for pick-up later in the day.,,,,
"I made a good choice!\"",,,,,
8587030,50247901,2015-10-10,44351489,Saul,"Rob was a wonderful host, he was extremely flexible with our check-in and check-out time. He had made us a welcome package with map/attractions of Boston,water and snacks."
The breakfast was a huge plus and very delicious!!!,,,,,
He made great recommendations on places to see,eat and activities to do. Thanks Rob for the Isabella Steward museum recommendation.,,,,
We really appreciated him checking in on us making sure we were not lost etc...,,,,,
His home is very beautiful as well as the neighborhood,his house is conveniently located near Savin Hill station,which facilitated our move around the city.,,,
"Overall we enjoyed our stay with Rob and would stay here again!!! \"",,,,,
8587030,50581819,2015-10-12,45541774,Greg,"Places like this are why My wife and I use airbnb.  We stayed here during a road trip to Boston, and it was literally one of the best airbnb experiences we've had!  Rob and his home were simply exceptional."
During the booking process,Rob was highly communicative and was very flexible with both our arrival time and dietary restrictions.  My wife and I were greeted with a glass of wine and snacks and wonderful friendly conversation as we settled in for the evening--the perfect end to a day we had spent exploring central and eastern Massachusetts.  Rob and David are great to talk to,and their dog Daisy is so sweet!,,,
The house is amazing.  The ground floor has a sitting area and piano,as well as a modern kitchen with breakfast bar at the island,and on a historical note,JFK stood at the fireplace in the formal dining room during his senate campaign!  There is also a lovely back yard area,although we didn't have time to enjoy it.,
The room is at the top of the stairs on the second level.  It's nautically themed (Rob collects ocean liner memorabilia),although not overwhelmingly so.  I have to say,Rob had just switched to colder weather bedding,and the flannel sheets were phenomenal.  We got some of the best sleep of our trip here.,,
When we arrived,there was a welcome bag and tray with snacks,water,pamphlets and magazines highlighting local attractions and goings-on (all of which were refreshed during the stay).  I had also mentioned to Rob that it was our anniversary,and he left a bottle of sparkling wine for us to enjoy!,
The bathroom is across from the room,and is very clean and well kept.  It was essentially a private bathroom during our stay,as Rob kept it but did not utilize it.  There is an office/library area next to it that has tons of amazing historical memorabilia.,,,
Breakfast in the mornings were delightful.  Rob served us at the breakfast bar in the kitchen and helped us with our planning for the day,and we even attended church with him on Sunday.  We were given a personalized code for the front door lock so no key was necessary.  The walk to public transportation is about 5 minutes (getting into the downtown area via the red line was very easy!),and the neighborhood felt safe.  Parking is on the street,but we had no problems.,,
"All of the personal touches to the house and the service are outstanding.  Staying here would have been a bargain at twice the price.  \"",,,,,
8587030,50990280,2015-10-16,31421476,Christian,"Excellent séjour de 3 jours chez Rob et son ami. Un accueil autour d’un verre de vin, dans une magnifique maison 1900, dans un quartier très agréable. Rob est comme un ami de longue date que l’on retrouve avec joie. On a plein de choses à se raconter, d’expériences à partager. Nos hôtes ne sont pas envahissants pour autant et savent se faire discret. Le petit déjeuné est royal avec des produits fraichement cuisinés par Rob. Il nous a conseillé pour organiser notre découverte de Boston. Il nous a fait découvrir le Isabella Gardner Museum, palais vénitien improbable hébergeant une riche collection.  Musé que nous aurions manqué sans ses conseils, à visiter si possible le jeudi soir en nocturne l’ambiance y est extraordinaire."
La chambre est spacieuse,calme,propre. La maison est richement décorée,subtile mélange entre objets du Queen Elisabeth,souvenirs de voyages et objets plus contemporains.,
"Notre meilleure expérience de location de chambre privée à ce jour.\"",,,,,
8587030,51992275,2015-10-25,15574009,Nikita,"This has been our best Airbnb experience yet. Rob and Dave were absolutely wonderful and welcoming. Their home is beautiful. We were greeted with wine, cheese, a welcome package, and great conversations and tips about Boston. The room is very clean, beautifully decorated, and stocked with everything you need from snacks to water to pamphlets about touring Boston. The bathroom is private and was perfect for everything we needed. Both mornings, we were greeted with fresh baked goodies (bread and croissants to be exact *drool*), a selection of cereals, and OJ. Rob found out we were tea drinkers the first morning, and had a kettle of hot tea waiting for us the second morning. Location was perfect, about a 10 minute walk to the subway and easy access to the main touristy areas. Parking on the street was easy. And of course, having Daisy to greet us every time we came in just made it that much better! Overall, our trip was great. We had an incredible time, and would love to come back again! We will be recommending this to any friend looking for a place to stay!"
8587030,52525681,2015-10-30,26603624,Alex,"We had an amazing stay with Rob and Dave and would recommend to anyone. Rob met us at his home as scheduled, parking was free, safe and easy to find on the street. His home is absolutely beautiful and our room and bathroom were very clean, comfortable, well decorated and exactly as described. We were given a care package when we arrived with some snacks, water and some tourist information for Boston. We were served a very nice breakfast and fresh pot of coffee each morning and Rob gave us great suggestions for the day. The red line Savin Hill station is an easy 7 minute walk from the house. The area is safe and we walked home each night around midnight with no issues.  We would not hesitate to stay again!"

8587030,54462975,2015-11-20,41665512,Clarisa,"La habitación en la casa de Rob es increible. Debo decir que tiene una de las camas más comodas que he probado en mi vida, en una habitación amplia, luminosa y hermosamente decorada... y con baño privado!. Además te recibe con un presente (muy buen detalle!) y te ofrece el desayuno todas las mañanas. Es algo lejos del subte (especialmente si vas cargando valijas, ya que son 7-8 cuadras) pero esta en un barrio tranquilo y seguro. Gracias Rob por permitirnos quedarnos en tu hermosa casa!"
8587030,55111520,2015-11-28,45909624,Aaron,"Rob and Dave are great hosts. This was a great stay, and I am sure all guests will enjoy this stay as much as I did. They also have great neighbors who are all very friendly and welcoming. The location is also very good, because even though it isn't in downtown Boston, it is close to the T stop, and Boston in general is very walkable."
8587030,67417248,2016-03-29,12245081,Amanda,"My boyfriend and I had a great time staying with Rob! His house is beautiful, very nicely decorated and clean. His dog, Daisy, was also lovely. We really felt as though we were part of the neighbourhood when we were in town. Rob had great recommendations as to what we should do and see while we were in Boston, which was really helpful, and the metro was close by as well. We would definitely visit Rob again!"
8587030,68558652,2016-04-05,7186660,Y. Zena,"Anyone who who includes chocolate cake in the breakfast offerings on Day One is an excellent host by any measure.  We were enchanted.  The previous guest reviews here are detailed and correct.  The house is gorgeous, reminiscent of one of the Painted Ladies in San Francisco.  But the most important thing, of course, is the host.  Rob is a kind and generous person who apparently loves to cook and keep a fabulous home.  We were comfortable, and were given a nice balance of privacy and sociability during our stay.  We would not hesitate to stay there again.  The only difficulty we had was that the internet connection was down.  Rob worked to get it up for us, but to no avail.  All in all, this was a great Airbnb experience.  You will not be sorry to join this wonderful family for your stay in Boston."
8587030,70820096,2016-04-21,6473595,Rich,This was an amazing air bnb. Rob was helpful and friendly and made us feel right at home. The house was incredible and the room was cozy. He provided breakfast and snacks and gave us great advice on sites to see. He was interested in us and we left feeling like he was a long time friend.

8587030,76634234,2016-05-28,20564193,Thorsten,"The room was exactly like described, very charming Cunard line style. It fits perfectly in the house,  which is completely styled and a highlight for itself ☺.  The room as well as the bath was absolutely clean, the bed very comfortable large. Rob was very kind and helpful, the way to mtba takes 1 0 minutes by feet. The taxi needed in rush hour 45 minutes from airport to the house.  It is also possible to do it by mtba. Unforgettable is Daisy,  the best 'guard dog' ever ☺"
8587030,77631593,2016-06-02,49460070,Ken,"Rob is an outstanding host who may make the best of AirBNB list. His nautical theme decor provides an interesting environment.  The spotless accommodations and attention to guest details earn a four star rating. Water, snacks and a USB charging station in the room and more K-cups for coffee in the kitchen are typical of high end hotels.  The neighborhood is peaceful and street parking for my rental car was always available. Wireless internet was easily connected and notably fast.  It is a short drive to the L street beach and Boston convention center."
8587030,78501177,2016-06-07,27269319,Blayne,It was an amazing experience!  The house was so unique and beautiful! I would recommend to all to stay here!!

Their home is a super beautifull,historic home and very stylish decorated. It is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood with easy acces to all Of Bostons areas.,,,,
Rob is a warm and generous host that was very easy to talk to and with fantastic humor. I truely enjoyed our conversations!

8587030,86132739,2016-07-15,5201388,Socrates,Rob was a wonderful host. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome. The house was awesome and very tastefully decorated. Impeccably clean and pleasant.  The bedroom we stayed in was roomy and full of light. A bathroom was reserved for our exclusive  use right across the hall (like 5 steps away). Wifi was strong from the room. Every morning a table was set up for us for breakfast. There was enough street parking to park our large SUV. All in all a wonderful experience. Would not hesitate to stay with Rob again in the future.
8587030,87694968,2016-07-21,9917790,Rebecca,"Rob's place was fantastic - perfect for my stay in Boston. Everything was super clean, well decorated, and the space was quiet. Would highly recommend!"
8587030,88315253,2016-07-24,6465540,Anouk,Rob and David were excellent hosts. They have a beautiful home in a quiet and nice part of Boston. Nice victorian houses. Very easy to go to downtown with the T-line. And free parking in front of the door. The room is perfect with airco and a good bed. And you have your own bathroom. Breakfast in the morning is pleasant and Rob shows you the spots to go in Boston. I would highly recommend this place.
8587030,89125279,2016-07-27,78495919,Wanda,"We really enjoyed our stay in Boston. Rob was friendly and knowledgeable  of the area. Our room and the bathroom were nice and clean and decorated nicely. The air conditioner  and snacks were much appreciated and the location is quite close to public transportation. Breakfast was simple but with lots of choice. Daisy the dog liked to greet us in the morning and when we came home. There is apparently a cat who lives there, too but we did not see it."
8587030,89783129,2016-07-30,82447780,Vinh,"I had a great stay.  The private bedroom and bathroom were very clean.  I was there for a business trip and was looking for a quiet place to rest and I got exactly that.  The wifi worked well and the house is conveniently located 10 minutes away from the subway on the red line.  From there, I could get downtown in another 10 minutes.  This apartment is a great alternative instead of a hotel downtown for business travelers.  I definitiely recommend this place."
8587030,92213487,2016-08-08,34131540,Patrick,So where to start... we don't know as this place was just awesome!
Rob and David are definitely superhosts and their house and hospitality is unbeaten.,,,,,
We arrived a bit early as we needed to return our rental car and Rob just organized his neighbor for us on short notice. We even stayed a bit longer on departure day which also was no problem. Besides that they just provide a totally unique setting and the rooms are fantastic. We have been in several Bed&Breakfasts in New England and Canada during our trip but none of them was so overwhelming like this house.,,,,,
Rob and David provide a full breakfast with fresh fruits,there is water,snacks etc. in the room,there are even great shampoo products in the bathroom... actually all better than in a lot of expensive hotels.,,
Location is great too as it is a 10 minute walk to a Red Line station and our Uber drive to the airport took 20 minutes only.,,,,,
Daisy (dog) and Zoe (cat) are living in the house as well and most probably you'll meet them during your stay which we definitely enjoyed.,,,,,
If you have a chance to stay at Rob's and David's place,you will definitely have a great time. We really enjoyed it and would return there any time in future when we are back in this lovely city. So we can recommend this place to the Airbnb community without any question.,,,,
Thanks for your hospitality,"gentlemen!\"",,,,
8587030,93759247,2016-08-13,7721925,Thomas,Staying at Rob's place was a good choice!
Rob and David are great hosts,"and they live in a neighborhood with very friendly and communicative people. I felt very well being there and enjoying Boston from the perspective as a local. Breakfast was great and I was provided with very useful information what to explore in town best also. I recommend this place!\"",,,,

The house is eclectically decorated/styled and everything you need for a great stay was there.  A great help yourself breakfast with a wide assortment of cereal and bread and fruit and juices. The room was very tastefully furnished and having a private, very clean bathroom was great.  Having not lived in Boston since the 70's I was a little concerned about the neighborhood, but there was nothing to be concerned about. My wife and I walked 10 minutes to and from the Savin Hill T station during the day and after 10 at night and had no concerns. It's a lovely AirBnB in a lovely neighborhood and wished we could have stayed longer. We will be back."

The apartment was great - very clean, cute, and clearly very well kept. The apartment was very inviting, and Haley helped us to feel at home right away. She was also kind enough to provide us with recommendations of what to see and where to eat, which brought us to our best meal of the trip. The apartment was in a great location in the North End! Overall, it was a great weekend trip!"

Her place was exceptionally clean and tidy, and was larger than I expected. The location was perfect and an easy walk to anywhere you wanted to go, not to mention surrounded by great food. She left very clear notes and directions and even left a list of recommendations for what to see and do in the area! Overall, this just added to an already fantastic trip!"

The location is good,close to the downtown area,parking was very easy to find,often on the street just in front of the house. The area is located among many restaurants and local coffee shops as well as a bar down the street and a beautiful pond (15 min walk).,,
The room was clean,there is no AC but two very big ventilators to keep it cool and well aired so that was a life saver!,,,,

6179374,45734527,2015-09-05,33739917,Mason,I had an excellent stay in the room. Helena was very proactive in making sure that I had everything I needed/wanted to make my stay better.
6179374,47010404,2015-09-14,43825647,Gang,This location is convenient.  It is close to bus stops where you can take a bus to train stations.
The bedroom was small,and furniture was old,but good enough for a traveler to stay for a couple of nights.  The internet connection was fast.,,,
The bathroom was very clean.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6179374,51345624,2015-10-19,45069946,Jordan,"I would start by saying that Helena sought to provide anything I needed during my stay, and I am thankful for that."
This was my first AirBnB experience. As a new user,I was unaware that bookings might not include amenities such as use of the kitchen. I understand now that this is a common occurrence.,,,,
I saw later,after arriving and discussing with Helena,that indeed the use of the kitchen was not included in the amenities. This was an oversight on my part.,,,
However,"I personally believe that it should have been and could have been made clearer in the written description for the booking. It was not apparent to me that I could not cook in the house and I would not have stayed if I knew that. Something along the lines of \"\"No use of the stove","yet you can use the microwave to heat food up\"\" would have been helpful. What did not make much sense to me was that I could use the microwave to cook eggs",which took longer and made more noise than making them all at once on a frying pan,but I could not use the stove even if I cleaned up after myself.,
Even though this listing is marked as a private room,it is a shared residence with many other tenants. It seemed like I needed to tip-toe around the house as not to disturb anyone. The description in the listing says you need to be very quiet,and this became very apparent right from my arrival. It made me a little uncomfortable when accompanied with not being able to use the kitchen,because I felt as though all the tenants did not want me there. I do not feel like that is an appropriate environment for a stranger to be in,to be honest.,
I also experienced an odd situation during my stay. I entered the kitchen at 6:30AM one day and there were four dead mice on the kitchen floor. I later thought it may have been the cat bringing them in,but at the time I became even more uncomfortable.,,,,
On the other hand,I did greatly enjoy the proximity to the Charles River (specifically since I was staying for the Head of the Charles rowing regatta,the Northeastern University Boathouse). The cost was relatively expensive (as a student),but I suppose reasonable when compared to hotels in the area on such short notice.,,

PLENTY of books to read if you get board - like living in a used book store.  Room was a bit chilly during Winter, but warmed nicely with space heater.  Not much of a kitchen (not even sure if it was open \"\"to the public\"\") so don't plan on doing any cooking.  Great location and wonderfully gracious host.\""

I haven't met Robert personally,it was Jackie to open the door for me and show me around. Jackie is a very charming person who provided very useful information on what to visit in Boston.,,,,
The building is located in a great area - full of nice,historic houses. It's within walking distance to Back Bay station,Prudential Towe,actually you can reach any touristic attraction on foot.,,
The room itself is spacious,comfortable and very cozy. It's full of books and antic-looking decoration,which really matches with the spirit of Boston.,,,
Jackie said I would share the bathroom with a couple,but I have never met them,so it really did not disturb me in any way.,,,
"Thank you once again!\"",,,,,
2846739,13485208,2014-05-28,4078074,Andres,"I thought it was good, Robert is very welcoming and knows a lot of Boston history. The house is very well located, nice neighbourhood and exceptionally well linked, with the station just a couple of meters. The house and the room gives you the feeling you are staying in a relatives old house, lots of stuff everywhere, not clean at hotel standards, but that somehow gives you the homey feeling. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who can't handle the mess."
2846739,13582188,2014-05-31,10546751,Philip,"Robert was very flexible when providing a room and was able to provide a key for me late in the night. The location was great, the room was nice, and I didn't run into any issues during my stay."

While my room was spacious, the rest of the house is a bit cramped and it can be a chore to get in and out of the house. However, considering that the location of his house is located very conveniently in the middle of Boston I have no real complaints. Robert also gave me some pointers on how to get into some of the museums and other sites I was interested in. I am grateful for my stay!"

The most important about the house is location, very convenient to get to most point of interest. Robert provided a lot of instructions how to get to airport the most convenient way and what is worth seeing in the city, which was of great help as my stay was rather short."
2846739,14240775,2014-06-15,7912750,Christopher,"The top feature is convenience--the row house is about a 5-minute walk from Back Bay Station and 10-15 minutes from Copley Square. The accommodations can be described as funky or atmospheric, depending on expectations."

Exactly what I would expect when I booked the room. It is a great experience, and if I were to come back to Boston, this would be on the top of my list."

There is a sink in the room so water can be accessed right inside the room. It is also furnished with chairs and sofa so there is plenty of space to sit. Overall I had a very comfortable stay.

2846739,21716348,2014-10-22,3365719,Keanu,Overall experience was quite good. I arrived Boston when there was a massive change of weather from warm to very cold (1 Celcius). I booked for two nights. THe room itself was good and quaint. Rob was very friendly and walked me through as soon as I got into the room of where to visit in a comprehensive way. The loo + shower is downstairs. I think we all werent prepared well for the sudden biting cold. I had to ask for a heater. Rob's place is just around the corner to the train station. Very handy.
Rob rent out his rooms out to overseas students as well. The kitchen area were quite filthy. I tried to have my shower at 1030am the hot water had ran out. The bathroom is being shared with numerous of people and you can expect the level the cleanliness to be not so good.  The internet wifi is dreadfully slow,I think its because so many users sharing the same line. This is a place for youth or backpackers who wants an affordable place that is convenient to go anywhere. The price is reasonably cheaper than most hotels. But if you are a adult who like to enjoy your holiday for a few days,"I would not recommend this place.\"",,,
2846739,21840341,2014-10-25,20709863,Mike,"The host, Robert, is fine. An English professor, and pleasant. The neighborhood and the location is fantastic. The Back Bay stations is half a block away, the Prudential Building is no more than a 10 minute walk, restaurants and bars within crawling distance, and Northeastern University a $2.50 subway or bus away, or a sub-$6 taxi ride to the heart of the campus. The room itself, is interesting. If you are a single guy, or a young couple, then I recommend it with an asterisk. The room is on the second floor, and you share a bath which is located on the first. Bring your own amenities, such as a washcloth and hairdryer (which is needed to heat up the freezing bathroom - I turned it on, and left it on, while I was showering so it warmed the bathroomroom while I showered). It is somewhat difficult to get in and out of the house, as you enter through a door that doesn't open all the way, and the reduced ability to enter is compounded by a pesky mailbox that is hanging on the front door further taking away from the potential angle of entrance. All this being said, I would stay there, again, due to the fact that a hotel room in this neighborhood would have run me $250+ a night easily, and the charge was $125. It was worth putting up with a few inconveniences for the savings. The room was clean, the bed comfortable enough, and I enjoyed talking with Robert, as he is certainly unique, bordering on eccentric (there are thousands and thousands of books stacked throughout his home, including this bedroom). Let's face it: you don't spend that much time in your room when you are in a fantastic city such as Boston, and in such a great neighborhood such as Roberts. Just don't stay there if you are looking for a 5 star experience and a warm bathroom..."

Good place to stay if doing last minute reservations and hotels are all booked/too expensive.

The shower downstair is marble tiled and everything seem to be in working order, except the bedroom door knob which I am sure it would be easily fixed by now. The bathroom is downstair which you have to walk through the kitchen, there is no lock in bedroom or bathroom door. Reminded me of England in the 70's where one must turn the sign from vacant to ( engaged ) or some one is using..etc. Robert and another tenant seem to be very nice gentlemen. There is no bell or buzzer in front of the house, I happened to forget my cellular phone so it was quite a bit inconvenient for me to find way enter the house but the problem was solved as soon as I found my way to send Robert a text message. It was an unusual winter in Boston, I am sure that additional snow had put more burden tasks , others the house could have put in well up keeping condition. The stay was quite an experience just like stepping into a novel , great place for the writers !."

The locations was truly excellent, the bed was very comfortable, and Robert (and the other man living there, whose name I'm sorry to say I've forgotten) were very helpful and gracious in welcoming me, carrying my bags to the room, and suggesting things I might do with my time. However, the state of repair and organization to the place itself left a good deal to be desired. The whole place, including the room, is extremely cluttered (far more than shown in the photo), which makes it hard to move around and gives the place a clausterphobic feeling. In the bathroom, towel and toilet paper racks are falling off the wall, and the shower door is broken. There was almost no hot water. That being said, I would still consider staying here for a short term visit when you're going to spend most of your time out in the city."

The house is under construction and very cluttered.   The room is large, however, very cluttered.  The walls and ceiling have large water stains.  There is a convenient double sink vanity in the room.  The bath is located on the floor below.  The bedroom and bath do not have locks on the doors."
2846739,32256997,2015-05-16,4418801,Acey,Nice and accessible place. Robert was welcoming and gave me great suggestions to go in the city.
2846739,32552748,2015-05-19,18168101,Arianne,Robert and Jackie were very helpful and accommodating.   We had a great time in Boston and the location was great - close to the subway and minutes away from everywhere we wanted to be.   Would definitely recommend!
2846739,32794086,2015-05-21,33132171,Michael,Robert was great!  I could have stayed all day talking with him. The location was so perfect as you could walk to all the major attractions within Boston.
2846739,33534211,2015-05-29,1311769,Lucas,"My stay at Robert's was quiet and comfortable. Robert made it easy to check-in and out, recommended some local sites to check out, and helped with my transportation questions. Overall a gray stay!"
2846739,33885512,2015-06-01,34386659,Hao,"Robert's room is very homelike and the decorations with antiques and books does show the style. During my stay, Jacky had as well helped me a lot from global travel plan to detailed transport suggestions. The location of the house is convenient. For a weekend visit in Boston, I recommend his place."
2846739,34974282,2015-06-14,19753431,Kansei,The room is decorated by antique furnitures. It was clean and comfortable. It takes only several minutes to Copley square by walking.
2846739,35359624,2015-06-17,35888283,Derek,Robert was a very polite and courteous host.  He even offered to go out while I was gone and put quarters in the meter.  House was very interesting and my room was clean.
2846739,35822912,2015-06-22,33943642,Ding,"A special experience in this room. The locationof the room is convenience and I went to someplace by foot or by bickcyle. Its enough.I didn't meet houst but the reception is a Chinese and so kindness to me. The awful thing of the room is so many things in the room(11 horses and 6 bookshelves,OMG ). I felt complicate frequency and hard to calm by myself."
2846739,36216216,2015-06-26,4605615,Emma,"Die Lage der Wohnung war super und auch der Gastgeber war sehr nett. Die Wegneschreibung war eindeutig und leicht zu finden. Das Zimmer war völlig in Ordnung,  sauber nur einige Wasserflecken an der Decke - aber es war zum Schlafen vollkommen in Ordnung. Das haus generell war für meinen Geschmack etwas zu vollgestellt und fast etwas unordentlich, da mein Zimmer und das Badezimmer aber vollkommen ordentlich und ok waren, war mir das egal. :) Das Internet hat nicht gut funktioniert und der Fernseher war kaput."
2846739,36402665,2015-06-28,8699798,Alison,Roberts is extremely knowledgeable about the local area - follow his tips. The room was exactly as described.
2846739,36584888,2015-06-29,35389160,Stephanie,"I enjoyed my stay. Great location, close to the T stop. Thanks."
2846739,37196261,2015-07-05,11048791,Jarred,"Host was fantastic.   Communication was timely and responsive prior to the trip, once we arrived and during our stay.   Very accommodating and quite generous.   The house was filled with a number of interesting items, books, and antiques. If you enjoy a few books (the house has plenty of them) and don't mind taking a trip down one flight of steps to share a bathroom, this place is perfect for you, especially given the location and the how accommodating the host was.   Would certainty recommend staying here."
2846739,38466209,2015-07-15,38249848,Charlotte,"Very nice and convenience place. Neighborhood is great, surrounded by restaurants, convenience stores, and only few min walk to the subway station. The price is reasonable, plus there is no minimum stay time. Highly recommended!!"
2846739,38562730,2015-07-16,5235973,Naomi,"All dealings with Robert were very easy, polite and accommodating. Robert was extremely quick and efficient in responding to my inquiry and accommodating a late check in and late check out.  The property is very well located, easy to get to everything. For the right traveler this is an excellent, well priced option.  I have additional comments which really are not critical but meant to help travelers more similar to myself understand some elements that are not clear from the picture/description."
The room is one of a few in the house rented out through airbnb and shares a bath off a kitchen.  It was not clear where the host was,I never met him or spoke with him during the interaction - a housemate I think let me in.  It was also unclear who else was in the home. As a single female traveler it felt uncomfortable.  The host is also a collector of many things including books.  The room and hallways are all extremely cluttered with these collected items and smell musty,not terrible at all but if you are an asthmatic,as I am,"this space may not be ideal.\"",
2846739,38805233,2015-07-18,8139298,Hannah,"It was great! Robert is quick and easy to communicate with, punctual and he even accommodated me needing to stay an extra night. The neighborhood is lovely – tree lined streets, super safe, amenities, close to transportation. The room itself has quirky old school charm."
2846739,39631149,2015-07-25,8001575,Daniel,"Robert was very helpful and welcoming. He communicated punctually and was accommodating about arrival and departure times. The room was nice, spacious with a comfortable bed. The neighbourhood was lovely with plenty of nearby bars and cafes."
2846739,40390814,2015-07-30,39267666,Eric,"Wonderful townhome in a perfect location - walkable to virtually everything in Boston. And Robert is incredibly nice and hospitable, and certainly interesting to talk to as he is a true academic. Highly recommend for travelers on the go!"
2846739,41614439,2015-08-08,35627496,Sam,"Jiaqi and Robert are very helpful: they advised many tourist spots on the first day when I checked in.  I have a lots in common with Jiaqi as we both come from the same province of China, hence we talked a lot during my stay.  The house is very center located, just a few minutes walk to Back Bay metro and commutor rail station.  Also it is just walking distance to Copley Square and Library.  Privacy is not a problem even I just rented a room in this 4-story house.  I enjoyed my stay here and I certainly will choose to stay here again if I come over next time."
2846739,42343724,2015-08-12,40549594,Rushi,Cozy house with great location. It is quite rewarding to listen to Robert's informative introduction about tourist attractions in Boston.
2846739,42802000,2015-08-15,40794369,Kathryn,Loved this house!!  Roberts assistant let me in and he was very nice and helpful.  They provided a map of the city and recommend the best route to see all I wanted to see.  Also meet Robert and he was very friendly and made sure I was settled and didn't need anything.  Beautiful home full of books and pretty furniture.  Easy walk to lots of attractions.  The house was quite and comfy.  When I come back to Boston I am staying with Robert!!!!
2846739,43132306,2015-08-17,40078687,David,"A great room right in downtown Boston very near the Back Bay T station! Robert is a great host- he even left me a towel, which is great because I forgot to bring one. One other nice thing about this room is that it has 2 sinks! That was an unexpected convenience for shaving/brushing teeth without having to leave the room. :)"
2846739,45708577,2015-09-05,8281289,Lidya,Robert is a paragon of hospitality and accomodation. He is an academic and his home can rival any public library. The location is perfect: walking distance in minutes to Back Bay T. i walked to many destinations and did all my sightseeing with no problem and safely. The brownstone is ornate but worn. My parlor room was spacious and clean. i wish it had an armoir or even a closet with hangers: a bit challenging to live out of a suitcase for a week and not having one hook to even hang a wet towel.

2846739,45830795,2015-09-06,22799829,Kiersten,Thanks for the unique Boston stay experience! I loved the magnificent old style Boston home. Very easy to coordinate and accommodating!
2846739,48181936,2015-09-24,5931053,Martine,"Lovely spacious room, quiet and a good bed. A bookworm's heaven because the house is stacked with books everywhere! :)"
I enjoyed a warm welcome and had a good stay.,,,,,
Shared bathroom,"but there is a sink in the room.\"",,,,
2846739,48417581,2015-09-26,7637128,Zan,"The room is really nice especially since we did not have the chance to stay in a vintage house before. Jiaqi is a great assistant host as he tries his best to plan out an itinerary for you while you are here. He also offered things like lending us a charlie card and buying back the value because we couldn't finish. His genuine concerns for his guests are truly impeccable. I manage to meet Robert once as well whom is a nice and polite gentleman although we did not speak much. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay there!"
2846739,50453134,2015-10-12,41007329,Lawrence,"The room was exactly as described, and the location was very convenient. It's a short walk to the Back Bay T station, and only a bit further to Copley Square. Robert was a very friendly host."
2846739,51499584,2015-10-20,4354813,Peter,"\"Robert was very communicative, and there were no major problems with the overall AirBnB coordination experience.  That said, the other reviews for this location do not accurately describe the listing.  \"\"Historic\"\" and \"\"run down\"\" are two very different things"
2846739,51636448,2015-10-22,3838198,Brianna,The room was tidy and had great character. Everything about the specific room was accurate and the bed was really comfortable.
The rest of the house was a bit cluttered and without any locks on my door or the bathroom,"I felt a bit unsafe as a single female in the home.\"",,,,
2846739,51875085,2015-10-24,35628037,Patrick,Robert is extremely helpful in providing tips and hints on Boston and the area around his home in particular. The home is centrally situated.
The private room I stayed in was large,clean  and had the feel of a library there were so many books in cupboards. In terms of areas of improvement I would stay it would have been great to have known the bathrooms were downstairs. Additionally the phone  number given is a landline and I was unable to reach him or his assistant telephonically on multiple occassions. I did reach them by messaging on the Airbnb app,"which seems to be their preferred mode of communication.\"",,,
2846739,52641837,2015-10-31,31365297,Philip,Robert was extremely hospitable and his house was walking distance from the freedom trail. Ideal for my needs.
2846739,53526570,2015-11-09,3937914,David,Robert was quick to respond to my questions and my booking. He provided travel instructions from the airport well in advance and was easy to communicate with.  The transaction was easy to complete.
The property is very centrally located being only a short walk from Back Bay station and in a nice neighborhood. Upon arrival I received a key and some of the basic info about the house and the area which was helpful.,,,,,
While the pictures do resemble the room,I found them a bit misleading. They are all taken from one angle. There were piles of books,paintings and other old items piled against the wall you can't see in the picture and they were very dusty. The bed and bedsheets were clean but the room needed a good hovering and dusting.  The shared bathroom could also use a good cleaning.,,,
While I only rented the room and used the bathroom,the house itself had piles of books and other items and generally looked very messy (the kitchen was incredibly messy!) I didn't mind it so much as I didn't use the shared spaces or the kitchen that much but it just felt unkempt.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2846739,70031139,2016-04-15,6367878,Jason,"Robert was a nice host. The place is a bit strange, as you have to use a bathroom that is connected directly to the kitchen where people sit and have breakfast. Kind of weird."
2846739,70942926,2016-04-22,35123984,Zhiyong,"Robert is a friendly host who shared with us important travel information about Boston on our arrival. The check-in and check-out process was hassle-free and flexible, which helped a lot for our travel itinerary."
The location of the apartment was also great as it is very close to amenities such as Back Bay MBTA (train) station,Logan Airport Express Coach pickup/dropoff,car rental at Prudential Tower,Star supermarket,24-hour convenience store etc.,
As we were there for the Boston Marathon,the location was even better as it is within walking distance to the Marathon race expo (Hynes Convention Center),"Marathon shuttle service to start point (Boston Common) and most importantly the Marathon finishing point (Boylston Street). It was also a short distance from the Charles River where we had our morning jogs.\"",,,
2846739,71067475,2016-04-23,61585014,Harbir,Robert was very kind and left made me feel right at home. Being new to Boston he told me about the place and made the experience a lot better. The room was as described in the description. I would definitely use another room from Robert.
2846739,71674630,2016-04-27,15028936,Bowen,Robert is a great host! Very friendly and even upgraded my room. Will come back again.
2846739,71885512,2016-04-29,11948661,Nathan,"Robert was very friendly and helpful.  He made us feel welcome and gave us tips on things and places to visit near the house.  The room is spacious.  The house is in a beautiful neighborhood with delicious eats, quaint stores, and cultural destinations all nearby."
2846739,72177819,2016-05-01,12627034,Carlo,Nice Xp!
"Perfect location to visit downtown boston \"",,,,,
2846739,74990038,2016-05-18,474461,Andrew,"Stayed for one night. Robert was lovely and took his time to explain the area to us. His long time home is stacked full of books, clutter and mismatched furniture but feels charming and old worldly. The room is big and comfortable, bathroom is fine. Didn't use any other room. He rents a number of rooms in the building and also has a student who helps him out with the bookings. The area is great and you can easily walk to many of the key places in Boston. I enjoyed my stay, thanks Robert."
2846739,75310920,2016-05-20,69109471,Shpresa,"There is no doubt that Robert is a great host. Friendly, kind and very informative. He can probably tell you everything you need to know about Boston. Awesome tourist tips."
The second floor parlor room was spacious and very helpful to have the sinks in the room so I could get ready without having to use the bathroom downstairs.,,,,,
The location was also perfect as I had to be at the Copley plaza for a conference. There are many choices for food/drinks in very short walking distance.,,,,,
Robert was very flexible with the check in/out. As a single female in the house I felt very safe.,,,,,
Thanks Robert!,,,,,
"(p.s I loved the Harvard museum of natural history. Thanks for the tip:)\"",,,,,
2846739,76584220,2016-05-28,67101421,Isabel,Perfect for access to Back Bay station - only a few hundred yards away and for Boston city centre attractions; Robert was so helpful with advice and guidance as to what to see in Boston - he is very knowledgeable. The room suited me fine and the house is completely authentic. I'd stay here again when next in Boston.
2846739,78985681,2016-06-10,47274139,Neha,Host was welcoming even at midnight
2846739,80425572,2016-06-18,47680009,Jaewon,"Robert's house was a very comfortable place and easy access to go what I want. And Jacky, Robert's roommate, was kind and nice even though I did not meet Robert. I highly recommend this house for eveyone who will visit to Boston."
2846739,85276101,2016-07-11,79647617,Paula,He provided clean bedding and gave great advice on what to do during my short stay. I was concerned that it was not possible to lock the bedroom door.
2846739,86593405,2016-07-17,27215788,Yuna,The best location at the heart of Boston. Robert is a very knowledgeable and friendly host. I strongly recommend to stay for traveling! Thank you!
2846739,88177965,2016-07-23,82540536,Teresa,"Robert gave me great directions from airport and tips around town, unobtrusive, had good privacy, smooth exit after stay, and always responded promptly to emails."
2846739,89488347,2016-07-28,15828318,Jennifer,He was very sweet and kind. He offered me a map and recommended places for me to see. It was wondrously quiet as well.
2846739,91996882,2016-08-07,72215901,Yaya,The house is a fantastic location in the city and the room is very beautiful and very well decorated. I only got one day to stay but they made it very flexible in terms of check in and out. They also gave a detailed information regarding the city so I could visit most places of interests in a day. I had a good talk with the host and they are very kind and considerate. Highly recommend anyone for a true Boston experience!
8034092,47290820,2015-09-17,305920,Jorge,"\"I'm going to try to be as impartial as possible and write my review based off of the latest information in the listing, which was updated after I moved out (definitely read it from start to finish).  Nobody wants to read a bunch of he said-she said.  Just some facts you may want to know.  When the listing says you can't have a car, that doesn't just mean there's no assigned parking, that really means she doesn't want you parking in any of the public non-permit parking spaces in the neighborhood.  The updated listing says you can't work from home.  If you're a student, I would ask if studying from home is allowed, since I don't see how that should be any different for the host than you working from home.  I suspect the better description would be \"\"I don't want you at home during the day.\"\"  For people staying in the summer you may want to know that there's no central or window A/C unit.  On the personality scale"
8034092,51299958,2015-10-19,20485606,Monica,"The house wasn't exactly what I expected. I've only stayed in one other place and it was more of a home. This was more like a rooming house with several strangers living in different rooms. Which is fine. Everyone was very quiet and didn't bump into each other very much if at all. There weren't any common areas, which is why her terms are strict to not have guests. And she can't have any cooking, since there is no countertop space. The place itself was really chocked full of stuff and there are notes everywhere telling you what to use and how to leave things. It was an odd experience, but the room was spacious and it was quiet, as advertised. On the first night there was hair in the tub, which I pointed out and told her about (I had arrived late). She was very responsive and tried hard to make up for it. She went out of her way to take me to Whole Foods where we had breakfast and chatted together. She dropped me off where I needed to go. She was a nice person and it felt like a safe place for someone traveling alone."
8034092,53577029,2015-11-09,13543692,Chris,"The room was exactly as it appeared (albeit surprisingly larger than the photo portrays). Simple, warm, homey space. Unit seems shared with long-term tenants. Unit only locks from the inside. Shared bathroom is as described by other guests. Spartan, and labels on almost everything with instructions of what to use, what not to use, how to use, et cetera. The entry hallway to the building is very cluttered (front door opens to a tiny foyer and landing, crowded by items all around), where guests proceed straight up the staircase, as the 2 hallways that branch off the entrance are closed off by curtains. There is a/are cat(s), though only encountered once in the entry foyer, not in sleeping area (entry does smell of cat, in case allergies are a concern). Room does get very warm (no individual thermostat). Neighborhood is quiet, though different impression may be had based on which approach to reach unit is taken. The neighborhood is only a few yards from commuter train lines and a highway just beyond, but cannot hear either inside the building. If approaching from far end of street, the walk is through a barren former industrial, now converted office park that may not be appealing to some, especially at night; the other side is shorter, and goes past homes and an adjacent shopping center, which is better lit at night. Otherwise, it is a short walk to a neighborhood popular with college students, with many bars and food options."
8034092,98743304,2016-09-01,35454263,Luigi,"The room was clean and comfortable and the house was in a very good position. Helena was kind, helpful and cominicative. She tried to help you as much as she can (i.e. she supplied me with a heating plate to make coffe with my moka pota)."
She suggested me things to do,"where to eat and gave me usefull information about transportation and events. Communication with her was very quick: she quickly answerd and usefull information were provided through notices in common areas though. The bathroom was always clean.\"",,,,
1885825,11415777,2014-04-01,13167730,Catharine,"Robin is a wonderful host! I thoroughly enjoyed meeting her and touring the house and its amenities. Unfortunately, I had to cancel my reservation and didn't end up staying there."
1885825,11725938,2014-04-13,12558823,Giuseppe,"The house is amazing, full of arts, warm and in a great area (we loved JP and its vintage shops). And Robin is very nice and helpful, you'll love the house and its rooms."
1885825,11964630,2014-04-20,13158181,Keenan,"Absolutely loved our stay with Robin in Jamaica Plain!  Accomodation is a very subjective topic with all kinds of different strokes for different folks, but for us our stay could not have been better.  We felt right at home from the moment we walked in the door--- and with the independence and freedom one feels at home as well. The house was just as it appeared in the photos--- very artsy, welcoming, warm, and with tons of character.  That's also how I would describe Robin.  Whenever I'd run into her at the house she'd always ask how things were going and always offered to help out in whatever way possible.  Then we'd end up chatting about one of the art pieces in the house and 30 minutes would go by in an instant!"
Jamaica Plain is a very hip neighborhood,lots of organic coffee shops and local food markets,etc.  It's not downtown Boston though,but that's the charm of it.  It's a beautiful green and open area which is nice to come back to after spending the day running around Boston/Cambridge.,,
If you are creative and/or open-minded and want to stay in a place that's warm and inspiring,where you feel right at home and can feel the creativity around you,then you've found it.  If you're the kind of traveller who likes 5 star hotels with spas and massage rooms,then maybe this isn't the place for you.  But then again,what are you doing looking for accomodation on Airbnb?  Live the experience,"you won't be disappointed!! \""
1885825,12060294,2014-04-22,1505235,Jane,"The Fox room at Robin's property was amazing -- exactly as pictured, thoughtfully and colorfully decorated and fun. The room and en suite bathroom were spotless, with plenty of room for bags and hanging clothing. The windows even have blackout blinds for a sound sleep! We really enjoyed our stay and found the location an interesting add-on to our time in the city for the Boston Marathon. It's fun to rent bikes at the station at the war memorial near Robin's place to ride around the area. I would highly recommend this room to others who want to stay in Jamaica Plain."
1885825,12215817,2014-04-26,10131787,Kim,Awesome place to stay!  Thank you Robin for your gracious hospitality.  I'm looking forward to many more nights in your lovely home.  Thanks!
1885825,12277662,2014-04-28,12225083,Viki,"I LOVED this house. I want to live there forever. Alas, I will only be able to stay there when I return to visit Boston.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and I am a convert for life. Robin’s listing is very accurate. The photos do not do the place justice."
Jamaica Plain is a charming,hip neighborhood with great restaurants and shops. All were walking distance from Robin’s house. Everything about the interior of this house had me enchanted. The artwork and fun and funky decor kept me constantly entertained. Everywhere you look the house is oozing with eclectic charm. And Robin's artist studio in the living room made me green with envy.,,,,
"The accommodations were splendid.  The \"\"Fox\"\" room has its own private bathroom making it feel like I was at a boutique hotel.  Being able to take a satisfying",hot shower at the end of a long day is important to me when I travel and this bathroom did not disappoint.  The bed was very comfortable and the comforter was cozy. Between that bed and the black out blinds it made for a good night’s sleep from the very first night. The room has a walk-in closet and dresser that allowed you to stash your ‘stuff’ out of sight.  There was sound system in the room that sounded fantastic.,,,,
Robin's kitchen is amazing. It is huge and it is fully stocked. Our all too brief stay meant we under utilized it. The house (and neighborhood) is quiet but there is a sound system on the main floor that is incredible,adding to the already charming ambiance of this very special house.,,,,
It was nice sharing the house with two other guests.  They were pleasant to talk to and we never felt like their presence detracted from our stay.  Robin was an excellent host with excellent communication (emails prior to booking were all answered promptly and asked a LOT of questions) She was very helpful once we arrived. My only regret was that our stay was too brief.  I am already fantasizing about my next trip to Boston and filling the other rooms with my travel mates!,,,,,

1885825,13003369,2014-05-17,10131787,Kim,"My stay was terrific!  Robin is very gracious and generally cares about her guests.  Her home is welcoming and provides any travelers with extras that mean a lot.  I loved my room - eclectic and warm, with lots of closet space/draws.  The bed is very comfortable.  Loved my stay and highly recommend to others."
1885825,15179080,2014-07-04,1089634,Stuart,"Robin and The Fox (Rm 3) are both great. Nice home, comfortable room w/ private bathroom, closet space, and excellent kitchen"
1885825,15332502,2014-07-07,4113751,Clementine,"Our stay in Robin's home was wonderful. Robin is a welcoming host who made us feel like home. We deeply enjoyed looking at all her decorations in her house, it is really original, imaginative and inventive. Her home is located 10 min walk from the T, which made it really convenient. In 15 min we were downtown Boston. No need to worrying about parking our car downtown and deal with the traffic."
Besides,Jamaica Plain is a nice neighborhood. It was great to discover Boston close suburb.,,,,
Stay in Robin's home and you will not regret it.,,,,,

1885825,18239570,2014-08-24,5450929,Kristin,"Robin's place was amazing! It's perfectly located, right outside of Boston and right near a subway stop. The Fox room was warm and pretty, with plenty of space for all of our bags and clothes. We really appreciated the stocked kitchen which had the fixins needed for breakfast and plenty of snacks."
Robin herself was very welcoming. She wasn't there when we arrived,but gave clear instructions on how to get into the house and showed up 10 minutes after we settled in. She even provided a hand-written map into the city and let us use her printer to print out our Red Sox tickets.,,,,
We had very little time to walk around town,but it was super cute and felt really safe. We hope to visit Boston again soon,and if we do,"we'll definitely stay with Robin again. \"",,
1885825,18483383,2014-08-27,18661929,Valerie,"We can't say enough about our first experience with airb&b at Robin's home.  The house is arty and fun just like Jamaica Plain and Robin and Victoria are wonderful.  They gave us great directions and suggestions for incredible dining experiences.  We will be back and sending friends.  The room we stayed in, the fox, was comfortable, clean, and colorful.  We loved being able to park the car and walk everywhere safely.  Great meals in the neighborhood included vee vee and Grass Fed."
1885825,18710379,2014-08-31,5811,Rachel,"I had a fantastic stay at this magical place. As a host myself, I can only say this was like finding a treasure in the city...  So glad to have found this place and I'm sure I will stay there again throughout the next 4 years, when visiting my college student. I have also shared this listing with many other college parents."
1885825,18942444,2014-09-03,17420011,Peggy,Ce séjour chez Robin était le premier avec AirBnB et nous en sommes ravies ! La chambre était  très joliment décorée et très confortable.

1885825,19090617,2014-09-06,20071949,Michele,"We had such a pleasant experience staying at the Roost III. The house is adorable, was easy to come and go, and our hosts were very helpful! The area of town felt safe and easily walkable to the train station, which was about a 10 minute walk.  The home was full of the host's original artwork, which was a treat to see! Very artsy and eclectic. The bed in this room is a full size bed, so it could possibly be a tight squeeze for a couple. The entire house was extremely clean and felt very much like a bed and breakfast experience. Great price and awesome location. Would definitely stay again!"
1885825,19214456,2014-09-08,3618454,Véronique,"Our stay at Robin's house was great. The location was perfect for us and we enjoyed walking around Jamaica Plains. The house is very nice and interesting and you feel free to come and go, more like an ''Auberge'' than a private home. We would go back to this address anytime."
1885825,19620337,2014-09-15,20284179,Réna,"I loved my stay here! The host was very prompt in her communications here on airbnb and provided some great information on the area. Her daughter was extremely helpful at the residence and gave us some great places to eat, told us about some take-out spots and was super friendly! If you love a firm bed like I do, then this room is for you. Also, the room itself had plenty of interesting things to look at and some cool ideas for decor! The rest of the house was the same.  I would definitely recommend this home as well as try to reserve again if coming back to the Jamaica Plain area of Boston!!!!"
One last (URL HIDDEN) was great that we had a private bathroom. The only drawback was that because the bathroom is small,the tub/space in the shower is small (but it is an older house,so that is expected). But it wasn't an issue.  If you are clausterphobic it may be,but for the short stay,it was fine.  Again,"I would book here in a heartbeat!\""

The room was quite big and private with it's own bathroom. The area, Jamaica Plain, has a lot going on and is also just a short train ride to the city. All in all this was an excellent place to stay!"

As the house was set back a little from the road and it was already dark when we arrived,we found the place a little hard to find. We have suggested to Victoria (the host's daughter) that a number and light would be helpful to new visitors.,,,,
Overall,we really enjoyed our stay there. The owners are clearly artistic,"and we enjoyed all the quirky items used in their decoration. We'd be happy to stay there again.\"",,,
1885825,20759515,2014-10-05,1129964,Faust,"We had a really great time at the Roost... It's a wonderful house, with à nice room and a very friendly kitchen! We met robin's daughter Victoria. She was nice and helpfull. It was a nice place and quiet, we enjoyed JP, it's another way to discover Boston. We recommand it!"
1885825,20989489,2014-10-09,18228896,Meng-Ning,Robin and her daughter Victoria are friendly and willing to provide support nearby and reply the txt message quickly.

E o Jazz, no som ambiente, de muito bom gosto. Jamaica Plain é uma região tranquila mas com vida própria, com opções de bares, restaurantes, comércio, etc. Recomendamos e, voltando a Boston, ficaremos lá novamente."

1885825,21465002,2014-10-18,17727451,Marcy,"If you're staying in Boston, definitely consider staying here! The house is super clean with fun furnishings. There were little extras that were great - visitor guides and maps in our room, provided linens, a cabinet full of board games, and some food in the kitchen for breakfast. The room we stayed in (The Fox) was more than comfortable with its own private bath, large closet, and tv. It was just as pictured online. The Jamaica Plain neighborhood is great too - The orange line T was a quick 10 minute walk, there are a ton of shops and restaurants within minutes, and the Arnold Arboretum is just a 5 minute walk from the house. We're looking forward to staying here again the next time we're in Boston!"
1885825,21706416,2014-10-22,20779188,Carol,"The Fox room at The Roost was exactly as pictured; quaint, inviting, and quiet.   It was an instantaneous means of getting into the vacation mode.  Robin had the room, kitchen and all the important information needed for our stay efficiently set-up, so we had virtually no problems at all.  The Fox room has it's own bathroom which was a plus."
We had an awesome experience exploring the JP neighborhood.  It is quite the happening place with something to do everyday.  Neighborhood restaurants abound; tortilla espanola at Tres Gatos,pistachio muffins at the Robinwood Cafe,and picnic fare at Whole Foods.  Lantern Parade was a sight to see.  The hot fresh pressed apple cider  had the most awesome buttery flavor I have ever tasted.  And a little known chamber concert at the Loring-Greenough House was a Sunday afternoon delight.  The L-G home board members served a wonderful afternoon tea complete with lavender pound cake after the concert.,,,
The blocks in JP are long so be prepared to walk a lot.  Not a bad thing because there is much to see and do locally.  Tall people and joint challenged people beware.  The house is a Victorian so amenities are not for people who are extra tall and the stairwell is steep.  Otherwise,it's a great place for base camp in JP.  Thank you Robin and Vivienne for a wonderful stay!,,,,

Nous sommes arrivée et il n'y avait personne mais les indications étaient claires donc nous nous sommes installés. Le quartier est super avec beaucoup de resto et les transports en commun très accessible autobus ligne 39 au coin de la maison et ligne orange de métro a à peine 10 minutes de marche. Quartier sécuritaire comme tout Boston je dirai. Bons conseils restos et sorties de notre hôte Victoria, fille de Robin, qui était présente pendant notre séjour de 4 nuits.

I slept like a baby.  Thanks for opening your kitchen which made my morning coffee habit super convenient.   Jamaica Plain rocks..what a neighborhood. Your home is just beautiful. . City Feed Sandwiches (thx for the referral) and all the conveniences just a 2 minute walk away on Centre and South Street.

Easy access to Boston. The house is about 15mins walk to the T station. A relatively short ride from the airport and was approximately $40 during the night. The house and room were impeccably clean and tastefully decorated.,,,,,
The bed was indeed very cosy for 2 (maybe a bit difficult to share for two friends ). This was clearly described in the listing.,,,,,

The house is super cozy with all kinds of funky art, plus our room (The Roost, Guest Room III) AND the hosts were lovely. Great location, cute town, super convenient (the bus stops right by the house; the T is about a 15 min walk; Ubers are always available). We'll definitely be booking with Robin and Victoria again if we're ever back in Boston!"

1885825,25132827,2015-01-07,22639947,Caroline,My parents stayed here when they visited to meet our new baby - here's their review!
This Airbnb had everything I expected and more. It was the little things that made the difference,shampoo and body wash in the bathroom and a good selection including home made biscuits and fresh fruit in the kitchen. A big plus for us was to find decaff  coffee as my husband can't drink normal coffee.  We only met Robin briefly when we arrived but she made us feel very welcome. It felt like home from home and I definitely intend to stay there on my future visits.,,,,

1885825,28816560,2015-03-30,28936146,Sevi,We really enjoyed staying at The Fox. The room was super clean and beautifully decorated which gave me the feeling that I am staying in a special place rather than an ordinary hotel room. Having a private bathroom and parking lot was definitely a plus for me. Especially because I preferred leaving the car at home and taking the subway which is super convenient since it takes only 10 minute walk to the station. The house has a very nice and big shared kitchen where you can enjoy your breakfast. Robin responded very fast whenever we needed her help which is very kind of her. (Thank you Robin! :)) Our only problem was the fact that our room felt cold during the night even though other parts of the house was warmer. After asking Robin to turn up the heater the problem was solved though. As I said I really enjoyed my stay and I definitely would like to stay there again whenever I visit Boston.
1885825,30473498,2015-04-22,12881471,Adrianne,"Staying at the Roost was an amazing gettaway. Our host was great at communicating, when we were curious about great restaurants around the area. They were even so kind to accomodate our early flight in to town. The room itself was perfect for a couple to fit nicely into the bed, and there was plenty of space in the back for all of our clothes in a dresser.  The bathroom was small but nice and quaint with extra shampoo, conditioner, and soap just in case. There were other renters, but we never saw them. It felt like we had the house to our own. Also, the host was nice enough to let us have some of their food in the kitchen. The area was very cute with victorian style homes on every street. The entire time we felt safe in the neighboorhood of JP. Also, the location was only about 20 min outside of Boston. This made it easy to take the subway in and around the city. We absolutely loved the stay and would recommend it to anyone."
1885825,30622749,2015-04-25,25866734,Rachel,"My 9 year old son and I just retrurned from a stay at Robin and Victoria's place in Jamaica Plain. It was our first AirBnb experience and we really didn't know what to expect or how the photos would match the reality, etc.  we were incredibly psyched with everything about this place.  LOCATION: Excellent! A couple of blocks from the hip downtown JP  with cool shops and restaurants.  15 minute walk to T. House is right on a main road but set back off the street and quiet.  HOUSE: really funky, clean, awesome place with anything you need.  Outstanding artwork on the walls created by Victoria, the host.  We stayed in the Roost and it was adorable and met our needs perfectly. My son and I shared the one bed and it was fine. We really enjoyed having our own private bath!  HOSTS: Robin and Victoria are super.  Interesting women with lots of good information. They are busy and not around a lot, but either were we so it was not a problem at all. They are very responsive on email if you need them. Overall: stay here!"
1885825,30958922,2015-04-29,4944355,Ruy,"Victoria was friendly and we had a pleasant stay, she kindly let us drop off our luggage early.  The room was charming and spacious, with ensuite bathroom.

1885825,32675965,2015-05-20,27189825,Jeanine,"Victoria was a great hostess! Friendly and helpful throughout my week at the Roost. I stayed in the Fox, which was a great set up for a single gal like me.  I liked the closet and bathroom attached to the room. Gave me the privacy I wanted. Having access to the kitchen was great as well. I would definitely recommend staying at the Roost!"
1885825,32930672,2015-05-23,33270330,Eunha,"I liked the JP neighborhood. I've stayed in downtown Boston before, and this trip let me see a new side of the town. It was overall a pleasant stay - the house was clean and the interior and decor of rooms and kitchens were very pretty. Robin and Victoria responded to my questions and requests very promptly. I didn't have any issue communicating with them through emails & texts. I didn't interact with them often, but my guess is that they would be very friendly and informative if you would ask them certain questions and initiate conversations (judging from previous guests' lovely comments left on the guest book at the entrance of the house). I value privacy, so not having to see my hosts often was actually a plus."
1885825,33490626,2015-05-29,18195721,Mandi,"This is a wonderful home & Jamaica Plain is a lovely area! We rented 2 rooms during our stay & both were beautiful, clean & exactly as portrayed in the pictures! We never met Robin, but Victoria was available at all times & was very kind & helpful! This home is outside the city, so it takes a bit more time/ planning each day to get out & explore the different areas of Boston- it's NOT bad, just something to consider! The T is a short walk from the home! We would definitely recommend this home to others & would definitely book again!"

We always felt very \"\"at home\"\" which was great in a foreign country. Victoria was often around and easy to get in touch with when we had questions. It was also easy to get in touch with the other guests when we met by chance in the kitchen for breakfast almost every morning. Everything was perfect! Boston is awesome and the neighborhood of Jamaica Plain is pretty nice with the parks. It was very easy to get to Boston. It took us about 10 mins to the T station and maybe 15 mins to Boston by Orange Line."
Our first Airbnb experience and it was awesome! Thank you so much! We hope to come back someday.,,,,,
"Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
1885825,53845392,2015-11-13,24983696,Alex,Efficient and reliable.
1885825,54878785,2015-11-25,42094598,Diewertje,"We had a lovely time staying here! The room was very cosy, nicely decorated, and well-heated. The bed was extremely comfortable. The house was also situated in a beautiful part of Jamaica Plain and in close distance to bars and restaurants and the subway."
1885825,58314964,2016-01-02,47344883,Douglas,My wife and I would definitely stay there again.
Pros:,,,,,
1. Great communications. Prompt,professional yet warm.,,,,
2. Neat old house. Historic and well built. Upstairs hallway floor matches planking of Constitution model at museum. Was it done by a boat builder? Super clean *****!,,,,,
3. Location - lots of great restaurants withing walking distance. 39 bus inbound goes to MFA and outbound to Forest Hills station station,which saves walking with bags coming and going.,,,,
Cons: None other than had to leave to come home.,,,,,
4.  Weather was freezing (literally) and room a little colder that used to in Texas,"but once in bed was actually warmer than when got home in own bed. \"",,,,
1885825,60129423,2016-01-19,24400880,Michele,This is our 2nd visit.  It was as good as the first time.  I really like the door code as our flights get in very late.  Everything is clean and quiet - just what we wanted.
1885825,66710521,2016-03-24,28876792,Amanda,"I absolutely loved staying in the Fox Room!  The entire house is beautifully decorated, comfortable, and quiet.  The house is located right near a bus stop, a short walk from a T stop, and they have parking on-site.  It couldn't be easier!"
"Victoria was also so accommodating and friendly.  This will definitely be my first choice for the next time I visit Boston!\"",,,,,
1885825,67157489,2016-03-27,4022918,Jancy,We spent 3 nights there and we were very happy. Everything was fine and clean. The house is real american style and we love that. We advice you to stay there. It's only 15min from the subway and 25 min from the city center by subway (in total +- 35 min from the center) and you feel like outside Boston.
"Thanks a lot.\"",,,,,
1885825,67835940,2016-03-31,20584780,Amy,Everything was perfect
1885825,70737598,2016-04-20,8245986,Camille,"We had taken a red-eye and arrived around 06:30 am. Our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm. When we arrived, we met Victoria and she welcomed us in and told us we could leave our bags until our room was ready. She showed us the kitchen and how to use the coffee maker. The home is a nice old Victorian home with some updates throughout and possibly current updates taking place.  The common bathroom downstairs was not very clean and the kitchen had a sign asking folks to wash their dishes and put in dishwasher. The problem was the dishwasher was full and it seemed like dirty dishes stayed in the sink for several days. Not a big deal but it did feel like we were the only people that had been there. Since our room wasn't ready, we decided to take the T into Boston. The home is located in a cute little area of Jamaica Planes and a short walk to the T and local cafés. The host texted us when our room was ready. Our room was clean and cute, not the room I thought we were getting but it was ok and we did have our own bathroom. We were in Boston to run the Marathon and explore, not necessarily hang out in our room.  Overall, the accommodations met our needs and expectations. The price was right, especially in Boston on Patriots day."
1885825,71250802,2016-04-24,5811,Rachel,This is my 2nd time with these lovely hosts. The place is convenient and located in a beautiful neighborhood. The hosts were very gracious with a couple of suggestions I made. You will enjoy your stay here.
1885825,71906173,2016-04-29,65100406,Chaveli,"Our experience at the Roost was awesome! We arrived pretty early but were allowed to drop our stuff off in the room anyway. The hosts were very helpful when we asked them for suggestions about what to do around town and local places to eat in. We felt right at home, and were so glad that all of our destinations in Boston were a short train ride away. The house is easy to access, and as a plus is very beautiful. We have no complaints at all! our experience was great, and we found ourselves staying in our rooms to hang out!"

1885825,78370731,2016-06-06,61277954,Rita,The room was so warm and homey. We loved the attached washroom. We spent most of our time exploring Boston but loved coming home to the Fox room.

The room was very cozy and clean, and the location is convenient to take public transportation, dinner outside. If I have chance to visit Boston in future,  I'll definitely stay at her place again!"
1885825,89636631,2016-07-29,48077085,Doug,My first Airbnb experience was terrific.  Wonderful neighborhood.  Easy to get into Boston.  Excellent private room with 2 comfortable beds and a private bathroom.
1885825,91680832,2016-08-06,2191531,Joan,Staying at the roost in the Fox room was perfect for two people. Everything  was just as described. The beds are comfortable the room is clean everything was just great! Very nice to have the hairdryer there and coffee and a light breakfast in the morning. Victoria was  very responsive and friendly. The location was perfect for what we needed close to everything and a safe and friendly neighborhood. We forgot a small item and she was easy to get a hold of  so we could figure out how to get that back. I would definitely stay here again it was awesome.

1885825,95259413,2016-08-19,75941092,Syd,"This is the first time I've used AirBnB, and it was much preferable to a hotel.  Hotels--even  nice ones--always have sketchy sheets and bed coverings.  The Fox room was immaculately clean, and the bedding felt just like that at my house--clean and fresh. I was on vacation, and we took Ubers everywhere since we wanted to see the city.  No trip anywhere in Boston or nearby communities is more than $10 if you're willing to pool. Enjoyed the stay very much and would stay here again."

It is conveniently located few minutes from downtown Boston in a very nice and safe neighborhood. I was able to find a parking spot right in front of the house. They made me feel very welcome. Upon my arrival we talked a bit over cup of tea and delicious fruit dessert. They made great recommendations about what to see in Boston and where to get the best clam chowder. My room and bathroom were very clean. The house is very quiet and peaceful, I slept well. The breakfast"

Casa tipica americana, molto carina ma come tutte le case con moquette in camera a volte fastidiosa x gli allergici alla polvere. Colazione buona ed abbondante. Siamo stati bene e possiamo consigliarlo."

Our bed was very comfortable and our room very quiet and clean with a ceiling fan and window air conditioner. We stayed five nights and each morning a wonderful breakfast was awaiting us. Their neighborhood is very safe with street parking in front. We highly recommend staying at their home and will do so when we're in Boston again!"
2843445,17032402,2014-08-05,19257010,Audrey,This was my first time in boston and we were lucky to come across Marilyn and Alan who were so kind as to pick us at the bus station after a long and tiring ride from Montréal. They gave us a tour of the city and useful tips. Their house is beautiful and clean as a whist le. The room is quiet and the air conditioning brings relief from the outside heat. Their dog Jackson is adorable and the food (snack and breakfast) delicious. I highly recommend the place.
2843445,17235355,2014-08-09,7895656,Denny,"I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Marilyn in person but Alan was great.  Although he has to work during the day, he made an effort to get home a little early to give me a key and get me settled in because I had to work in the city that evening.  My schedule was hectic and unpredictable but they were very accommodating.  All in all, the space, room, bathroom, internet, etc was exactly as describe and a great value compared to hotels in the area.  I would definitely stay again!"

They truly wanted us to have a great experience.  They offered great advice on food and other locations.  I enjoyed talking with them! Highly recommended!
2843445,18749307,2014-08-31,16925779,Todd,"Marilyn and Alan were definitely the dynamic duo of hosts.  A few superlatives come to mind: organized, immaculate, cheerful, thoughtful, and generous. They welcomed me like I was a long time friend. Marilyn always had my breakfast waiting with a bunch of fresh flowers. Each day I ate a variety of cereal, fruit and her homemade muffins!"
Alan gave me directions,restaurant recommendations(as well as mattresses) and helpful consumer advice.  Thanks to Jackson,"I was greeted with licks and wags in exchange for scratching that \"\"spot\"\" and tug-of-wars.\"",,,
2843445,19173892,2014-09-07,19387732,Philip,"As soon as I arrived, I was greeted at the door with a smile and a firm handshake. I could tell that Marilyn and Alan had dealt with young people before (I later learned, they've got 6 children and step-children, all adult now). All in all, their home felt like MY home for a couple of days."
Disclaimer: I was very tired (went to Boston Calling music festival each day),but the bed they had me in was incredibly comfortable. I was so happy with 4 pillows,air conditioning,and I got 3 fans going for maximum white noise (which I love). I slept better than I have in weeks.,,
I was greeted each morning with a continental breakfast that was plently enough for me (6' 190lb 20-year-old,so that's saying something). Their dog,Jackson,was very friendly,and it was only after I said that I like dogs that they let him out to interact with me (in case I didn't like dogs).,
I loved having free street parking,as I just left my car there and used Uber to get to the T station in Forest Hills. For me,Uber + T cost $9 one-way,but if you were so inclined,you could catch a commuter rail (restricted hours and days) from the Roslindale Station,which is within 5-10 min walking distance of Marilyn and Alan's home.
All in all,I have absolutely no complaints. Great place,"great people.\"",,,
2843445,19656219,2014-09-15,10370871,Emily,My boyfriend and I had such a wonderful experience staying with Marilyn and Alan.

Marilyn welcomed my friend and I with an awesome little snack and scones that she made herself and were really good! She was really kind and her and her husband helped us with the directions to go to Boston. The house is lovely and so is the room and the hosts! Very close to Boston and it is easy to find your way to the city. I highly recommend that place!

Their gracious welcome (and that of their dog Jackson) was wonderful and sincere. I was given a complete tour of the premises, a complete sheet of explanations and house rules, and a welcome drink of mineral water. Marilyn and I told each other our stories, and then, for me, it was nap time."
The room I had faced the street,and gave a distant view of the Boston skyline to the east. The bed was very comfortable,the temperature perfect,and the entire place was spotless. I needed to do a little work and used the WiFI service provided. I tested it at 20Mbps DL and 10Mbps UL...certainly more than enough for email,music streaming,and even Netflix movies.
Marilyn provided a list of restaurants all over the Boston area,and as a local,I certainly thought she made some great choices.,,,
I slept soundly,had a great how shower,and then a lot better and more complete breakfast than I usually make for myself.,,,

2843445,25940793,2015-01-30,26428535,Dan,"I came to Boston in an effort to help my brother who also lives in Roslindale. I wanted to stay close by which proved a invaluable considering a few days after arrival the entire city was closed to anything but emergency vehicles due to a terrible snow storm. Alan and Marilyn made me feel comfortable right from the start.  When the storm hit, they were incredibly accommodating even providing some extra winter wear so I could walk warmly to my brothers. I had done something with my right Achilles the day before , and by the time I worked and walked back to the house, it was throbbing very badly.  Marilyn was kind enough not only to make me tea to warn me up, but provided some of her topical pain reducers which helped enormously."
Since no one could drive,my hosts were home for 2 days. I helped Alan take some snow weight off of an upper deck and Marilyn was they asked me to join them in a game of Scrabble an invited me to preparing a wonderful soup.  While my laundry was being done,sit down with them for lunch.  It was truly a wonderful meal made special by my wonderful hosts.,,,
My room was clean and neat. The bed was firm like I prefer. It was warm and comfy even though the winds were howling outside. Everyday they had a very nice continental breakfast waiting for me,and a big smile greeted me but that's a rarity since they both work.,,,,
The only thing that can't be changed is there are quite a few steps to their home and then to the room. After I hurt my Achilles,"it was a challenge to get there but I always did.\"",,,,

2843445,38403382,2015-07-15,27289010,Leanne,"Our stay with Marilyn and Allan (and their playful boxer Jackson) was a delight from the beginning. They picked up from the train station, welcoming us with warm smiles and friendly hugs. We were then given an overview of the city plan while on route to their lovely neighborhood. The house is great, with views toward the city and a very private space for guests with bathroom, bath and a very comfortable bed. (Towels were washed daily!) It was a pleasure to walk down to a continental breakfast and sample Marilyn's home baked treats. Public transport is a short walk away, as are some great restaurants. Any of our queries were met with more than helpful advice and instructions. We would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone. A real home away from home, genuine and generous hosts and true value for money."
2843445,39043015,2015-07-20,36162542,Shannon,Marilyn and Alan are terrific hosts.  They welcome you into their home like you are family. She served Apple Brown Betty with ice cream while we reviewed a few things including good restaurants nearby and discount tickets for the MTA and the MFA. Everything was as described and pictured. Thanks so much for your genuine hospitality.

We were greeted right away and got to have a welcome snack and they also gave us a small orientation on restaurants and places around where we were and also tips about the public transportation system. Marilyn washed towels everyday so we had fresh ones and even folded my laundry for me! Next time I go to Boston, I will stay with them because it felt like I was just staying with someone I knew, and that's important to be comfortable and happy with your stay! Thank you!!!"

We immediately felt the positive energy in the house. They prepared a delicous snack when we arrived and took the time to explain us in detail how to travel by public transportation, which was super appreciated and useful. They even shared their \"\"charlie cards\"\" so the transport was very effective. We did not need to take our car at all to visit and it was a plus for us. They gave us advice on things to do in Boston"
2843445,51189780,2015-10-18,39367979,Narmadan,"We had a wonderful time staying with Marilyn.  The location is fantastic, there is ample parking, her home is beautiful, the bed the comfortable and she also provides a home cooked breakfast.  This is a terrific option for staying in Boston."

The neighborhood felt very comfortable, with ample parking and proximity to all we needed, including our one week old great nephew!  Marilyn and Alan went way beyond average expectations:  great breakfasts with home-made muffins and fresh-squeezed orange juice (at least I think it was, with lots of pulp!), clean towels every day, loan of their Museum pass which saved us $$$, very willing assistance with any needs, such as printing our boarding passes.  It was a pleasure staying with them!"
2843445,56441959,2015-12-13,28052773,Amy,"It is always a delight to stay at Marilyn's airbnb. This was the third time we've visited. She and Allan are the perfect hosts.

2843445,68323841,2016-04-04,55307102,Judith,My host was there when I arrived and made me feel welcome right away. I knew I would be in the attic but did not realize I would have to climb a flight of stairs just to get in the house. After awhile it did not matter.
My host gave me breakfast every morning in the dining room. She also gave me tips on sightseeing as well as the use of her Museum of Science card.,,,,,
Jackson,the dog,is a boxer,but kept well under control.,,
In nice weather you can sit out on your own private deck. I did so for a bit on Saturday. By the door to the deck is an extra table so you can get out of your room to play cards,read or just sit if it is too cold or wet to be outside.,,,,
Entrance to the bathroom is a bit tight because of the layout but once inside it is fine. Plenty of hot water and towels were there; also soap,shampoo,and toothpaste if wanted.,,,
Bed is comfortable with plenty of pillows. There is a closet and dresser so you can unpack and feel right at home.,,,,,
All in all it was a good place to stay while I attended a family function. Thank you,Marilyn.,,,,

2843445,81606029,2016-06-24,77129698,Martha,"Marilyn and Alan made me feel completely welcome starting from the minute I arrived. They introduced me to Jackson, their adorable, well-behaved Terrier-Boxer-Pitbull mix dog. He came on the tour of their beautiful, immaculate, New England style home. Its unique style and architect is what gives their home its charm. It does have several stairs so it is something to consider if you have any handicaps or health challenges, but Marilyn explains that in her description."
The two bedrooms they share on AirBNB are on the third floor with a full bathroom and a deck that looks out to their back yard and garden,which gets full sun in the afternoon and is a great place to read or meditate.,,,,
Every morning Marilyn and Alan put out a full complete breakfast of homemade scones and muffins,fresh fruit,assorted teas,juices,and other delicious treats. Plenty of yumminess to get you started for a day out in Boston.,
Marilyn supplies you with plenty of booklets,pamphlets,and guides on Boston of places to eat,things to do,museums to visit,and how to get there.
Every day you are given fresh towels. Trash is removed from both the bathroom and your bedroom on a daily basis.,,,,,

2843445,83116779,2016-07-01,77129698,Martha,"Marilyn and Alan were very welcoming. They gave me a tour of their beautiful, clean home and reviewed their house rules. They allowed me to ask any questions."
Marilyn and Alan cleaned and tidied my bedroom and the upstairs living area every day when they got home from work: emptied trash,refreshed Italian sparkling water,replaced any towels,and stocked up on toiletries as needed.,,
Once a week (if you are lucky enough to stay longer than a week),they do a whole top floor super cleaning day: they change all the linens,clean the carpets,dust,clean the bathroom from top to bottom.,
They put out the most delicious breakfast every morning,more food I could ever eat,but then you have snacks for later!,,,
Marilyn and Alan are always happy to give advice on where to go for dinner or sightseeing.,,,,,

I was late booking somewhere to stay for a conference I was attending in Boston and found this gem only a week before I was leaving. Irene was very accommodating and I had no problems checking in even though my flight was 4 hours late. The room is very big with lots of space in a quiet neighborhood. The bathroom is a bit smaller, but more than enough, and it's private. The experience was very private too and I almost never saw Irene or any other guests during my stay, unless when I wanted/needed to."

The room itself is comfortable, with plenty of space for a suitcase and a desk to work at, with lots of available power sockets.   I found the bed astonishingly comfortable, which really helped adapting to the timezone!"

I would choose it again in a heartbeat."
1090413,35373173,2015-06-18,30171528,Glenda,Irene was waiting for me even though I was somewhat late and didn't even think to phone.  She gave me info to get me started and then additional help during my stay.
The location is a super big plus for this accommodation.  I walked to the art museums,the Boston University Theater,the Pru Center (often) and many other places.,,,
The basement room was clean and large,but only had a single bed,so wouldn't work for couples. The bathroom is very small,but everything worked. The kitchen is right outside.  I only used the fridge,so don't know about the rest.,
There were a couple of robes and pairs of slippers for guest use.  A nice touch and handy for slipping out to the kitchen at breakfast time.,,,,,

I was staying at her place for a conference at the Sheraton (literally less than a 5 minute walk away) and she walked with me the first night to make sure I knew where I was going. I shared with Irene that I am pregnant and, being a wonderful children's book writer, she gifted one of her favorite books to me and my baby-to-be :) Awesome location, wonderful host. My only note would be that while the private bathroom is great, it's a little on the small side, so for larger folks, it may be best to ask for dimensions before booking so you're not surprised upon arrival. Altogether, highly recommend the room and really like Irene!"

As for the location,it was just perfect. There are two T stations very close by her place,so it was very efficient to go around the city. Since I was there for the Boston Marathon,I liked it most that it was close by to Expo and the Finish Line.,,
Also since it was right next to the downtown area,I was able to go to everywhere by foot which also made me to save up some money.,,,,
"I would definitely recommend to my friends to stay at her place if they were planning for a trip to Boston. \"",,,,,
1090413,72165106,2016-05-01,5490106,Diane,"Irene is a very  kind-hearted host and her house is at a great location, very close to the public transportation. The area is quiet and safe and I enjoyed it a lot. However, I was a bit disappointed in the room: the bed was very small, as was the bathroom;  the room  is in the basement, which means there is no real windows and the room cannot be  naturally lit. When I arrived, the room smelt moisty ( but it was very clean). I would say that Irene's room is the right place for single people who want to be away from dawn to dusk...  If you're looking for a cosy place to rest, you  might look for something else !"
1090413,74299600,2016-05-14,62764658,Lutfi,"Great Experience. Irene was warm, helpful and gave me a great insight into Boston life. She responded quickly to any questions and arranged to meet me and advised me how best to get there from the airport (which was really easy)"
The room was secure and very spacious with a great en-suite bathroom and access to a well stocked kitchen and well equipped laundry.,,,,,
The location was brilliant: residential but  with parks,a convenience store,shopping centres and the Backbay cultural scene on your doorstep.,,,

The room (en suite) is very spacious and it has all you might need for a work and/or holiday visit. The room is located in the lower storey of the house,so it feels very private and quiet.,,,,

Thanks to that I was able to easily find my way to places to eat (and drink), grocery stores, the T, pretty much everything I needed. And the location is great, I was able to walk to my conference in 20 minutes."

9255725,57791271,2015-12-29,27338386,Leah,Todd was fantastic and very accommodating in helping book the ideal room for my parents. I told him about my mom's difficulty  in navigating stairs and he directed me to a more suitable room. He was also very quick and responsive to all of our questions. Will definitely keep him in mind for their next visit!
9255725,75469701,2016-05-21,50599508,Marion,"Todd is a fantastic host. The description of the location was very precise and easy to follow. The renovated houses are well equipped and give you a feeling of being welcome and being part of a greater international airbnb community. I met people from China, Canada, Peru, Brazil, Abu Dhabi, Great Britain and so on. This was a great experience besides having a nice room to stay in and a kitchen to prepare meals. Depending on the time of the year you might even be able to sit on the bak deck and enjoy sun, wind and green sights. Allston is a great neighborhood. Harvard Education Portal is close by. The offer Yoga courses and more that are open for public. I enjoyed living in this neighborhood and loved to ride my bike both directions - either Harvard Square or Coolidge Corner.  Charles River isn't far either and the bicycle path brings you straight into Boston Downtown. Todd was great during my stay (from March to end of May). When I needed any advice or change of my booking or just had a question or idea, Todd answeeds immediately and always was very helpful in getting things arranged. He ist very open minded, kind and supportive."
"It was my very first airbnb experience. It was the best I could have done for my prelonged stay in Boston. I felt at home and had a hard time leaving this place.  I deeply recommend staying in Todd's airbnb-places. \"",,,,,

It was fun and educational to try some of her wonderful Chinese dishes! One of the highlights was her beautiful garden.

The bed will make noise,so if you are very sensitive to that,then you may want to reconsider. I still had a nice sleep. If you are a group of loud people,"other tenants will be disturbed even though they are on different floors. The overall experience is good and fits in our need.\"",,
6151079,32287022,2015-05-16,13359373,Sherilyn,"Nigel and Eva were wonderful hosts and were responsive from the very beginning, answering questions I had prior to my stay. The room was very lovely and just as described/pictured. Very simply furnished. The bathroom is private and not shared. Their neighborhood is quaint and safe. I didn't walk around at night at all but I always felt perfectly safe. It's a very short walk to either the train station or the bus will pick you up right at their intersection; very convenient to everything. There were many things that Nigel and Eva did to make my stay pleasant. The first night I stayed there I realized I had brought the wrong kind of charger and therefore needed a cell phone charger for use during my trip. Nigel was kind enough to run me over to the store in his car and wait for me whilst I ran in and procured another charger. Eva made a smoothie for me, and another night I had asked them if there was a place near their home that I could get green juices and smoothies. They said not really, but were so kind as to offer to stop and pick me up one from a place in Boston on their way home.  So much hospitality! They offered the use of their wonderful espresso machine in the morning as well. Their mother was also staying there. She doesn't speak English but is very sweet and helpful and unobtrusive.I felt very at home there because Nigel and Eva and their Mom were so welcoming. I would encourage you to stay here if you are visiting Boston. I will definitely stay with them again when I return. Can't say enough good things about them. Note: this is not a place for someone who can't climb stairs. They live in a condo with two flights of stairs which are not super difficult except if you have any mobility issues."

The room was perfect for me - comfortable, simple, clean and the location worked for getting to the conference center quickly - and it was nice to be so close to a beach for an evening / early morning stroll.  I finally, on my last day waiting to the taxi to the  airport, found time for a peak at the roof deck - I wish I'd had time to sit back with a glass of wine up there one evening......"

Nigel responded very quickly to all my questions. 5 minute walk to T and 12-13 minute ride to Boston Commons. My only reservation is that as a single female, I felt a little uneasy walking back from T Stop late at night on Friday and Saturday in the summer but I'd definitely go back!"

The room/bathroom is just as advertised, clean, bright, quiet, private and close to transportation.   It was a bit difficult to lug a heavy roller bag up the stairs as the stairs are steep but that wouldn't keep me from staying in this spot again.  I loved this place!"

I also asked if they had an ironing board and there was one waiting in the room for me.  The room was spotless and very nicely decorated.

The set up if the room is more like in a hotel. This us greats not to have to share the bathroom with somebody else. Special thanks for letting me in before the 4.00 pm check-in time.
6151079,53155204,2015-11-05,33548948,Anja,"For a one-night stay in Boston between 2 business meetings I needed a room near South Station. I found just that in Nigel and Eva's apartment. Walking distance from the subway, quiet neighbourhood. The room has a comfortable bed with a bathroom en suite and was just what I needed. Being jet-lagged, I went to bed early and woke up at 4:30 am to catch another train. It was all possible. I just hope that I did not wake anyone up."

6151079,55771499,2015-12-05,50414474,Jon,"Everything fit the description perfectly. Only issue that my guest and I felt was weird was that the walls were rather thin, and the floorboards creak slightly so it can feel as though you are making a ruckus, even though you're probably not. Originally, we thought that the owners lived in the other doors in the apartment, but (we believe) that is not the case."
6151079,70621902,2016-04-19,45111027,Heather,Great location.  Close easy walk to the red line.  Jon and Eva were very accommodating.  They went out of their way to make room for us when I messed up on our date of arrival ...arriving one day early.  Really enjoyed the set up of their home.  we had the master bedroom on the 2nd floor. nice room with nice private bathroom.  we had a private entrance which was so nice not to bother the home owners when we came in and out.  We shared a beautiful updated full kitchen with one other tenant.  We  cooked our own breakfast and dinner most days which helped the budget so we could spend more exploring the wonderful city of Boston.  I highly recommend this place.

6151079,80118475,2016-06-16,75673580,Melanie,This was my first Airbnb experience and I could not have asked for something more perfect. I booked the room very last minute through instant book and received an almost immediate response from Jonathan. I booked a private room but we had the place to ourselves since no one booked the other room that night. It was amazing! The apartment and room were charming. In a decent location. And the use of the washer and dryer was the cherry on top of an already wonderful sundae. I highly recommend staying here if in Boston. Definitely worth it.
6151079,88035106,2016-07-23,45321482,Jennifer,"Jonathan was wonderful!  This place was so clean, comfortable and beautiful.  I can't wait to come back!  Jonathan was also very helpful as well with suggestions on things to do, and restaurants in the area.  I highly recommend it!!"
6151079,88283682,2016-07-24,45321482,Jennifer,Jonathan was wonderful!! This was my second time using air B and B and it was so far my favorite experience!
Jonathan was very helpful,and I absolutely love my room and the entire apartment.  Everything was clean and new,and there was a beach across the street,and restaurants just a few blocks away.  I travel to Boston often for business,"and I can't wait to stay there again soon!\"",
6151079,89896365,2016-07-30,9948459,Makenzie,"I really enjoyed this space! It was super spacious, updated, I got my own bathroom, and the bedroom had plenty of light plus a desk! The bed was comfortable, and all in all a really wonderful experience. Do note that sometimes you will be staying with other airbnb guests, as opposed to the actual hosts, however the hosts gives very clear instructions on entry and ensures the noise level is low. Would definitely stay again!!"
6151079,90715753,2016-08-02,61875735,Nicoletta,"Everything was perfect: super clean and new!!!!location close to the Subway, bike rental and highway!!!!"
6151079,91466610,2016-08-05,9948459,Makenzie,"Loved this place sooo much! Clean, new, spacious. Will definitely be staying here again!! Jonathan was super accommodating as well."
8886703,51590789,2015-10-21,45786960,Amber Irene,"Natalie and Kwame were lovely hosts! I got to meet the both of them when I arrived in town, and not only were they helpful with informing me about things to do in the city and helping me schedule transportation means, but they were kind enough to offer me meals and snacks to take with me when I left. The room is just as pictured and is a comfy stay. I am very glad that I found such kind hosts, they are extremely welcoming to their home and the area. If i am ever in Boston again, I would definitely choose Natalie and Kwame as hosts! Very considerate, very helpful, I enjoyed my time in the city and got all the places I needed to be with their help."
8886703,52182096,2015-10-26,31793861,Iris,"Natalie and Kwame are fabulous ArBnb hosts. They provided all the necessities for the toilet and went the extra mile to provide additional items like bath towel, bath soap, shower cap and bath sponge. The bedroom door does not have a lock and both of them immediately installed a new lock. Natalie was helpful in providing tourist info when I asked and she even got some tourist brochures for me. Their home is near the train station so it is very convenient."
"Natalie and Kwame are  really committed to providing Airbnb guests a good Airbnb experience. It was really a pleasant stay for me at their home.\"",,,,,
8886703,52545186,2015-10-30,42833016,Laphai,"Great place. Didnt meet with the host until the 3rd night, but everything went really well. The bed wasn't the best, but the house was quiet and heater worked perfectly, so I was able to sleep at night. Spacious room and a nice house."
8886703,54809052,2015-11-23,35453201,Humberto,Great experience! Natalie and Kwame are extremely nices hosts and very warm persons. They will make you feel at home and very welcomed. The house is beautiful and located very close to a commuter train station that will get you quickly to downtown Boston. The room provided was very clean and had everything I needed. I asked the hosts for an iron and they kindly provided one for me. The kitchen and the restroom are very clean and well kept. They also helped me with information about how to get to the place I wanted and gave me a lot of helpful tips. I would definitely stay again if I am back in the area. Thanks guys!
8886703,59543268,2016-01-11,4017777,Nancy,"Natalie and Kwame responded very quickly to all of my inquiries and questions prior to the stay and just made things easy all around. The room--and the entire home--was super clean, welcoming, comfortable, and warm (it's midwinter so that was a huge plus!). All needs were provided for--the bathroom was super-clean as well, and clean towels provided. I slept so well. The parking was really convenient, and the home was only 1 mile from the Boston Nature Center where I was taking a weekend class. I left my coat in the bedroom closet and Natalie actually brought it to me at the class site! That was such an unexpected kindness."
8886703,70675356,2016-04-19,65443933,Giovanni,"La stanza è esattamente come nella foto: non c'è assolutamente niente se non il letto gonfiabile (che comunque ho trovato molto comodo). Non c'è modo di oscurare le finestre, quindi se vi dà fastidio la luce al mattino potrebbe essere un problema. La casa complessivamente è abbastanza pulita."
Il quartiere non è granché e come specificato nell'annuncio ci vogliono 20' di treno per arrivare a Boston (treno che passa solo una volta all'ora),ma la stazione è davvero molto vicino a casa.,,,,
Natalie e Kwame sono stati gentilissimi,i migliori host che io abbia mai trovato. Disponibili a darmi ogni informazione di cui avessi bisogno,libertà di accesso ai loro spazi (cucina,"sala da pranzo e salotto) e piacevoli con cui parlare. \"",,
8886703,71361585,2016-04-24,64569735,Alexis,Very friendly hosts. Gave us fresh towels to use and offered us tea. Also gave us some tips regarding the local tourist attractions. Would recommend.
8886703,72234089,2016-05-01,66888959,Isis,"Natalie was so accommodating, especially with my last minute request for me & my boyfriend to stay there for the weekend. She offered to drive us to a brunch spot not too far away, and gave us a bunch of suggestions for things to do in Boston, as well as offering us her cereal for breakfast. She also let us come by as soon as I requested to book, and let us leave at night rather than her said check out time to accommodate us due to our delayed bus home. Her and her husband's home was clean, along with their bathroom that had great shower pressure. The only downfall out of two was the neighborhood wasn't too great, so we couldn't hang out around the house much. But the bus was just a minute was away that took us to the train station, and Natalie made sure we knew where we were going. Also, our bed was uncomfortable (it was an air mattress); there was another empty Airbnb room next to ours with a regular bed, and I wondered why we weren't offered the more comfortable room. Overall, I do recommend if you don't mind having to jump on transportation, and you're just looking for a place to bunker down after a long day of adventuring :) thank you Natalie!!!"

8886703,96055250,2016-08-21,84598597,Ricardo,"It's a clean and quite place, very easy to commute to where you want to go. The host where very nice they where not there for most of the 3 weeks that I was there so we practical had the place to our selves."
8886703,97478229,2016-08-27,86734658,John,"When our original host had to cancel the night before we flew into Boston I was a little nervous about finding a good place to stay without breaking the bank. Natalie and Kwame definitely came through for us. We flew in late and arrived at the house at an hour I wouldn't feel comfortable bothering anyone at, but they made their home available to us. The room was plenty big and the bed was good. Overall I was pleased with the accomodations. What really made the trip so much more comfortable was how easy communication was with them. Any questions we had they answered and in a very timely manner. Unfortunately, we did not get to spend much time talking with our hosts in person (not because they weren't available, but we spent all of our time exploring the city). Not to mention transportation to downtown Boston was a breeze!"
1110423,6328304,2013-08-08,7434120,Allanda,Very responsive.  The apartment is a good size and well equipped. The location is excellent and off-street parking a godsend.  There is a bus stop right outside for those who take public transport. Several restaurants and a 7 day minimart very close.  Rishi & Shruti are a lovely couple and I would stay there again.
1110423,6494684,2013-08-14,7474467,Marjorie,"RISHI est très sympathique, il nous a donné toutes les informations nécessaires pour avoir un séjour agréable."

In this case my last resort should have been my first. This condo is cozy, relaxing, beautiful, quiet, and better than any place I've stayed in Boston. If its available book it. You won't be let down. Convenient location and great neighborhood. I have no complaints at all."
1110423,6551882,2013-08-16,5108426,Andre,"Great place to be. So great I had to checkin again. Cozy, warm, home away from home. Beautiful home and beautiful neighborhood."

1110423,7312201,2013-09-15,4004567,Lewis,Rishi was a fantastic host and met us to suit so that we could get the keys and enjoy our stay. A very clean modern apartment which I would recommend to anyone. Many thanks again.
1110423,7532288,2013-09-23,8777243,David,"When all the hotels near my client were sold out or outrageously priced, I figured I'd try Airbnb.  Rishi was very easy and pleasant to deal with, and met me at his condo with the keys promptly when I got there.  The condo is not huge but was very nice, and worked out quite well for me and my business partner.  I regret that we spent most of the time working, so were not able to take advantage of the kitchen, but maybe next time.  The location and surroundings were quite nice as well.  Next time I need to see that client I will check with Rishi first."
1110423,7719690,2013-09-30,1470545,Jason,"Rishi and Shruti were great hosts. Their place was as described, and had an excellent kitchen and lots of fun glassware. The location was pretty convenient for at least 3 reasons:"
1) the 24-hour convenience store across the street came in pretty handy),,,,,
2) Deep Ellum,a great bar,is less than a mile away,and a pretty easy walk.,,
3) Easy access to bus lines.,,,,,
"I'd definitely stay here again.\"",,,,,
1110423,8277600,2013-10-23,1795476,Allie,The place was conveniently located and spacious with everything you need. Hosts were responsive and reliable. Thank you.
1110423,8391399,2013-10-28,9506541,Jessica,"A great experience staying in Rishi and Shruti's apartment.  Comfortable and quiet, it was a great place to rent for a couple of days of work in and around Boston. Rishi was super responsive to every question I sent to him and my arrival and departure were both easy and low-stress.  I will definitely be in touch the next time I come to the Boston area!"
1110423,11363263,2014-03-31,8777243,David,"This was my 2nd stay at Rishi and Shruti's place, and just as nice as last time.  It is small but nicely furnished.  Rishi is easy to deal with and accommodating.  The wireless internet is fast for when we needed it.  The condo is in a private courtyard so quieter than if it were right on the street, and there is a reserved parking space."
1110423,11513165,2014-04-06,3358662,Nicholas,"I had a great stay at Rishi's lovely condo in Boston. Although Rishi was abroad when we arrived he went to the effort of having one of his relatives check us in and show us around the apartment - very thoughtful. The apartment itself is excellent. Stylishly decorated, comfortable and well situated for my visit to Harvard Business School. Rishi was communicative, friendly and helpful. Many thanks for a great stay"
1110423,12113191,2014-04-23,11397379,Denise,"\"THANK YOU isn't enough for the amazing visit we had in Brighton!! I was coming to Boston to run the 2013 Marathon and delayed in booking rooming accommodations and felt lucky to find anything available 3 months out from the race, but Rishi's place was beyond PERFECT for what I needed.  The house is exactly as pictured/described and Brighton was the quiet reprieve I needed pre/post-race.  We used the Green Line T to travel in/out of downtown, which is less than a mile walk (there is also a bus if you prefer not to walk) and then about a 25 min ride into downtown (or a $16 cab).  It was so nice to have a quiet place to stay with room to spread out and a kitchen to cook all my own meals.  There is a convenient store across the street that has the basics (and a winning lotto ticket for me!) as well as several local places to eat and grocery shop.  This was THE BEST place for runner's looking for a spot before the marathon and/or people wanting to see more than just \"\"downtown\"\" Boston!  Rishi was extremely flexible with our travel schedule and even had the place ready to go very early on our check-in date so we'd have someplace to go after a 6 am flight.  If we're ever in Boston again (hopefully for another marathon!) we'll definitely be reserving with Rishi!  THANK YOU THANK YOU :)\""
1110423,12218892,2014-04-26,8801025,Manu,"One of the best airbnb hosts, if not the best, I have had in my time using airbnb. Rishi went well out of his way to make our study comfortable, and even dropped off some things at the place that we needed. The apartment is amazingly furnished and very comfortable."

1110423,13761492,2014-06-03,3529025,Julien,"Rishi's place is nice, the parking place was very appreciated, and even if we didn't meet our host, there was no problem for communication, Rishi was very reactive. The T is a bit far away and you have to count about 45 min to go to Downtown Boston, but maybe the bus option is better, i didn't try that. Anyway, this is a recommended place for staying in Boston, especially if you come by car."

Good for walking as far as Boston College. I would recommend this place and hope to stay here again, but next time I will come with a bike."
1110423,16010166,2014-07-20,15296760,Lucy,Rishi was a great host. He was at the end of the phone anytime we needed anything. The condo was a great space for our family of 3. We enjoyed the kitchen with all the modern facilities. Our son loved the Apple TV. The neighbourhood was quiet and everyone in building was friendly. The shops across the road were handy and the supermarket around the corner was also great.

Highlights: Public transportation (Green line) is about 10 minutes of walk; Designated parking slot is a gem; Brand new kitchen and kitchen equipment; Charles river is a close if you’d like to have a walk/run/bicycle/riversports or have a fun with your kids on kids playground. The condo is sunny,nicely decorated and comfortable. An Organic food shops,grocery stores,cafes or restaurants  all are 15 minutes walking distance. WiFi.,,
Lowlights: a Friday BBQ smell is soooo delicious from the backyard :),,,,,

1110423,19208508,2014-09-08,8881688,Andrew,"Rishi was a great host and we found his apartment as a good home base while we were in Boston. When researching and booking the appointment, Rishi was very responsive and professional. The apartment looked as advertised and was a good space for my family. It was conveniently located by the highway, Cambridge and obviously Brighton, where we had family. It has a CVS across the street and nearby grocery stores which were really easy to access if you have a car. That was one of the best things about Rishi's place, the free parking spot, which is nice in Boston. Plus it was only a 1/2 mile walk to Brighton Center where there were plenty of restaurants and shops. When we had a couple of questions during our stay, Rishi responded very quickly. I would highly recommend this place for a stay in Boston. Thanks Rishi!"
1110423,19396263,2014-09-11,11742225,Landry,"Rishi's place was very nice, easy to access and clean. He was very helpful and responded to my questions via text quickly. Would definitely stay again!"

1110423,19824668,2014-09-19,19267756,Yossi,The apartment was as described and is truthfully a nice apartment. We were however not very impressed with the way that the apartment was prepared for us. There was still garbage in the trash cans both in the kitchen and bathroom. There was a half eaten chocolate bar still in the freezer and still food in the fridge and freezer. We were also unhappy with the bedding on the beds; we were not provided with duvets and only sheets were provided to be used as covers. The bed in the second bedroom is very uncomfortable as you can only sleep on either side of the bed if you don't want to be poked in the back. In summary: the apartment is great but it was not very clean which is very important to us.
1110423,20237368,2014-09-26,13044215,Karim,Rishi was a great host and his place was clean and comfortable. It was in a convenient location close to all amenities. I highly recommend staying here.
1110423,20907235,2014-10-07,2961304,Erik,"Rishi was great! Friendly, communicative and helpful. The apartment worked well for our needs. The price was much better than what we could have gotten at any nearby hotel. Though it accommodates 3, you'd be better off with two for maximum comfort as the space is fairly small (as to be expected for Boston) and the guest bed is not the most comfortable thing I've ever slept on. Overall though, it is a great space and Rishi was a great host. He went out of his way to assist with my early arrival and ready the apartment ahead of time. Getting in and out was easy and he does all the work. All you need to do is show up and enjoy. I would happily stay again. If your travel plans take you to this neighborhood, do yourself a favor and book this apartment!"
1110423,21145989,2014-10-12,21266611,Manuel,"Rishi was an excellent host.  He reached out to me to answer my questions and to provide any additional information.  He explained the procedure to get the keys and made sure everything was ready for when we arrive.  The apartment was as described, very comfortable and ample.  The neighborhood is nice and close to public transportation.  You even have a convenience store across the street!"
1110423,21347566,2014-10-15,17301657,Mathias,"We had a great time at Rishis apartment. It was very uncomplicated to get the key, Rishi always answered quick and was very helpful in questions about Boston. The apartment had everything we needed, was clean and really relaxing after long days sightseeing in Boston. We were able to use the WiFi, Netflix, his audio receiver and also there was a place to park our car in front of the house. I would highly recommend him, thumbs up!"
1110423,21663451,2014-10-21,21166790,Catherine,Our host was very responsive during the time leading up to our arrival. This was particularly helpful since it was our first experience with airbnb. And when we arrived the condo was very clean and certainly appeared as advertised. We also appreciated our host's respect for our privacy. Our experience exceeded our expectations. We highly recommend Rishi for those interested in visiting Boston.
1110423,22022645,2014-10-28,16822148,Bhavana,We had good first experience with Airbnb. Condo was clean and met our expectations.
1110423,22599530,2014-11-10,22454802,Jessica,"Rishi was very helpful and available by text message, and the apartment was very clean, nicely decorated, and well maintained.  We enjoyed the nice kitchen, and the shower is quite nice as well. The heat worked well but took a while to kick in."
The second bedroom is more of an office with a futon,which has a ridge in the middle,and both beds were rather short (I stayed on the smaller one,my feet went off the end,"and I'm only 5'6\"\").  It's a few blocks from the T",but very nice to have dedicated parking; a map of where the parking spot is might be helpful. Overall it was very comfortable
1110423,23678721,2014-12-08,11143237,Michael,"Listing accurate, apartment clean and cozy.  Great location in heart of Brighton with easy access to Cambridge via #86."
1110423,31138459,2015-05-02,3436390,Chris,"Rishi was not able to meet us and left the keys in a lockbox outside the unit - easy to get in. The unit's neighborhood was as advertised. While the unit was a 2 bedroom unit, the beds were not adequate for our business trip needs. The primary bed was a full size bed, and the second bed was a non-standard futon that was very hard and that had a large crease in the middle. My colleague was not able to sleep well on the second bed."
The unit also did not appear to be professionally cleaned - dirt had collected in the corner of the bathroom for example.,,,,,
Also,while I appreciate that the owners live in the unit,there was an overwhelming sense that we were staying in their place (all the food in the refrigerator,all of the bathroom items still in the shower,pictures,etc.). There was no room for our stuff in the closets because of the owner's belongings.
Next,there were minimal instructions on how to use things like the TV/Receiver,the heat in the bedrooms (wasn't able to find it).,,,
Next,the owner was not very responsive to communication during our stay. One critical issue came up and only after we had left (2 days later) did we receive a response.,,,,
Finally,the sheets and towels appeared to be college leftovers,and one of them was quite dirty and unusable. I'd recommend asking the owners if they have purchased sheets that actually fit the bed (the top sheet on the full size bed was actually a twin size sheet) and towels that are larger than ones that you'd find at a 24hour fitness.,,,
In summary,this unit was in line with the experience of staying at your buddy's place,"but would not be considered a hotel replacement. I only write this because at the price we paid this was on par with nearby hotels and we had expected the unit to exceed the hotel experience (usually Airbnb is known for that). In this case it did not.\"",,,
1110423,32822198,2015-05-22,29762395,Marianne,Rishi emailed and texted a welcome and checked in with us the first couple of days.

Futon was comfortable and had no issues with a bump. We had a person sleep on the couch,  who has isues with her back, and she thought the couch was super comfortable too. Great location for our needs of visiting colleges. Dunkin Donuts within walking distance for our coffee fix in the morning."

His place was beautiful and spotless. When we arrived our room was laid out,and the keys waiting at the front desk which removed any stress. All the details were covered (hair dryer,soap,shampoo,first aid kit etc.),which makes you feel like a priority guest
If you're looking to stay in a hip neighborhood in Boston on a budget,"look no further.\"",,,,
2564544,13555360,2014-05-30,15970680,Mike,"The picture doesn't do this place justice. The room was wonderful. It was in a great part of the city - very close to the waterfront and a lot of restaurants. It was clean, had fresh towels, and a beautiful view. He even set up a printer so I could print my boarding pass! I would look to stay here again if I'm ever in the area."
2564544,13594133,2014-05-31,16002176,Samantha,"John was a wonderfully patient, informative, and friendly host! He answered numerous questions we had regarding the metro/bus systems in great detail and always responded in a timely manner. He made us feel very comfortable and welcome in his beautiful abode!"
John's apartment is in a perfect location! Just a 7 minute walk to/from the Silver bus line to the airport (bonus: it's free out of the airport),and a few blocks from the T's South Station. The room itself was immaculate and posh,with fluffy pillows and a bed that will make you take in a few more Zzz's! As if that wasn't enough,the bathroom is large,modern,and stocked with fresh towels
"Out only regret was that we could not enjoy John's company or his spectacular apartment longer. What an amazing place equaled only by its owner. \"",,,,,
2564544,13633445,2014-06-01,6957384,Samuel,"Simply the best way to sleep downtown Boston. We arrived early in the morning to get the keys and to have a shower. There's a person at the reception to open the door for you, and take you to the elevator. It's at the 15th floor, the view is amazing."
The room was very clean,fresh towels and sheets,private bathroom. Modern appartment with style. It's way much better than the hotel.,,,
Communication with John was easy and fast,and he's very nice,taking the time to explain and talk with you even if he seems busy.,,,
We came me and my girlfriend from Montreal,Canada,for the American Craft Beer Festival that was litterally 5 minutes walk from his appartment. And if you're into it,there's Trillium Brewing Co. right next to him on Congress St. that is delicious.,,
"I will only consider his room when I'll come back in the area! Thanks John\"",,,,,
2564544,13899003,2014-06-07,4788595,Mark,"John was truly a gracious host, and his apartment is spectacular.  I'm reluctant reviewing positively, however, as I want to make sure it is available whenever we return to Boston!  Thank you so much for your accommodations!"
2564544,13933833,2014-06-08,16132407,Chelsea,"My husband and I had a wonderful experience staying with John! This is a gorgeous apartment with an exceptional view of the Boston Harbor. John is very inviting and more than willing to give advice and information on the area. Our bedroom had a beautiful view, an en suite bathroom and a very comfortable bed. The apartment was situated in a brand new complex with all the amenities! The concierge at the front desk is available to give you keys upon arrival, and there is apparently a beautiful gym/relaxation area at the top of the building, which we sadly didn't have the opportunity to use. We parked our car in an overnight garage just down the road, and left it there friday night and all day saturday for only $13, which was very convenient. It was very easy to walk to all of the touristy areas. All in all, we're giving John 5 stars! We would absolutely stay with him again, and would recommend him as a host to absolutely anyone without hesitation."
2564544,14138078,2014-06-12,6704111,Linda,"John was a gracious host who knows a lot about Boston and is a great resource for things to do, places to eat and how to get around the City.  My room was great - a comfortable bed, attractive furnishings, a view of the harbor and a window that opened to let in the evening breeze.  An added bonus was that John's place is an easy walk to the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center."
"If I have another occasion to come to Boston I would check John's place first and stay there again.\"",,,,,
2564544,14163892,2014-06-13,16059431,Nicholas,John was very hospitable.  It was a nice place to stay and see Boston.
2564544,14193143,2014-06-14,13636370,Ed,"John was a very helpful host to me, kind and easygoing. Appartement nice and is well situated in between Boston Logan, South Station, harbour and city. Let's not forget a VERY comfortable bed. Pricing might be a point to concider, though fairly in line with hotel-pricing in Boston (at the night of my visit)."
2564544,14484152,2014-06-20,1857087,Peter,"John was a great host, being around and available while also being flexible about check-in and departure timing.  He's also a great conversationalist and well travelled and experienced.  The apartment has a grand view over Boston and is very comfortable, cleanly and simply decorated.  I recommend a stay!"
2564544,14894690,2014-06-28,9909138,Chris,"Excellent (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication was quick/efficient and the apartment was in excellent condition with a great view in South Boston / harbor.  This is an interesting area of downtown as well, with great proximity to some real hot spots.  I also appreciated his flexibility in trying to arrange for my arrival given my tricky schedule as well.  Will most certainly be returning."
2564544,15116116,2014-07-02,372846,Bianca,John was a great host. He was very accommodating of my schedule and helped me find my way around. The apartment as well as John's demeanor led to a very tranquil oasis in Fort Point. The bedroom had large windows to catch the sunrise over the harbor and the bed itself was very comfortable. I would definitely stay again!
2564544,16168015,2014-07-22,18061429,Nadine,"This was my first airbnb experience and I was unsure what to expect. However John made it an amazing experience. His place is fantastic, so close to South station, stunning views, and he is the most welcoming host. He took the time to go through things to so in Boston, restaurants and even bought me a latte at 5 am. Really went over and beyond all my expectations. Thank you so much for allowing me to stay. His flat should definately not be missed, nor his hospitality!"
2564544,16252728,2014-07-24,16146480,Jonathan,This was my first experience with AirBNB and it was a blast.
John had everything ready for my arrival,clean sheets,clean towels,spare keys,WiFi information etc... I really appreciated that because I was in rush for the conference I was attending. His place is really near the seaport hotel and wtc,about 8 minutes walk. Also there is a public parking on the same street (A street) and it's way cheaper than the seaport parking so keep that in mind. Plus you can leave your car there overnight. The neighborhood is very calm and quiet. John was very kind and answered all my questions.
I don't see a reason to book with hotels anymore. AirBNB rocks :P,,,,,

2564544,16431597,2014-07-27,14010411,Alex,"Location: if you're taking the train to South Station it's a 10 minute walk. If you're flying, it looked close on a map. Can't beat it."
The apartment: very clean and classy,with an amazing view and fancy hotel-quality bathrooms,towels,bed. It also has one of those shower curtains that bends out,giving you extra room in the shower. Always love those. John was a friendly and welcoming host.,
Only downside: the blinds in the bedroom don't make the room very dark in the morning.,,,,,
Would definitely stay there again.,,,,,

2564544,16632919,2014-07-30,18208245,Bob,John's welcome was exemplary: I came in well before the afternoon check-in time hope to explore Boston for the day. John was able to make this much simpler.  I picked up the key and was able to enjoy the rest of afternoon exploring.
When I arrived later in the day,his detailed instruction were right on the money and I went right up to this extraordinary view; what a great place. Instructions for WiFi were handy and the room has a in-suite full bath: NICE!  Oh,and what a view!,,,
"The number of places within easy walking distance where amazing food and entertainment can be had is also a joy.\"",,,,,

Though I was mostly busy taking an exam during the days that I was there, he was very accommodating, and was always available to answer any questions that I had. The location is very ideal, being a hot spot for restaurants and shops, and for those just there on business. I would love to go back someday."
2564544,17150639,2014-08-08,9318197,Charlotte,A friend and I stayed at John's while we were attending a conference at the conference center over the August long weekend. And we're very glad we did!
The location was perfect; just a 5 minute walk to the conference center,various nice restaurants and coffee shops. The apartment is as nice as the pictures make it look,it is very clean and fancy and the people at reception are very welcoming.,,,

Tremendous views of the harbor from a very cool apartment in a very cool, brand new retro building.  I had not spent time in the South Boston waterfront neighborhood previously and loved it - great cafes, restaurants, pubs, renovated lofts.  A terrific area."
In addition,John was an ideal host.  Incredibly responsive and helpful.  Provided excellent recommendations in terms of spots to visit in the neighborhood as well as very clear directions relating to the logistics of checking in,wifi access,heating/cooling,etc.,

Well furnished, clean en suite accommodation with a very comfortable bed and all modern comforts provided.  Location is good but a car is useful.  Arrival, key pick up and welcome flawless.  Highly recommended."

The apartment is well furnished, comfortable, has a beautiful view and the host, John, is very accommodating and supportive. The room is small but comfortable; the bath is somewhat larger.  For my purposes, attending a convention, it was a perfect situation.  The area is safe for walking all hours of the day and night, and there are amenities at all price ranges close by. The concierge and all the other owners I met were very friendly and welcoming.  If you are comfortable sharing an apartment (have your own private bedroom and bath) this is a fantastic place."
2564544,18676904,2014-08-30,6146264,Willied (Will),"John was an amazing host! My mom and I stayed in a private room w/full bath in his modern apartment located in the south end of Boston. The apartment has nice windows throughout the home, welcoming in natural light and great views of the harbor. John has various maps and tips for his guests which is very helpful for sightseeing around Boston, however; if you just want to kick back in the apartment it is extremely cozy. John's place is just under a ten minute walk from South Station (red line) and just a ten minute ride on the T to get into the heart of Boston. The building is very easy to find and extremely safe and secure. This listing is great for everyone (vacationers, businessmen/woman, and students).

Additionally, the location was perfect with restaurants and other attractions/transit nearby, was a short cab ride to the airport, and he had all kinds of info ready and waiting for his guests should they have need of it.

3898015,59977811,2016-01-17,35752369,Joanna,"Ari lives in a typically Boston-style house in a neighborhood reachable by bus from the city center that is like a professional mini-hostel with all the necessary equipment, even a hairdryer in the bathroom at your disposal!"
He helped me with booking a taxi to a suburb of Boston and came over to check if I was pleased with the place :),,,,,

3898015,60443460,2016-01-23,30824856,Esther,The room was very nice and in an awesome location. It has a porch attached which would be especially nice in the summer. Ari is a super friendly guy  and very kindly allowed me to store my bag in the house for a bit after I checked out. I would definitely recommend this place.

The room was clean, neat, and cosy, with the bathroom just steps away. Ari was a great host and I am sure that I'll visit again next time I need a place to stay in Boston."

We did not know just how many people were going to stay in the house (there are about 9 bedrooms) ahead of time so we were surprised by that because many of the rooms housed couples while we were there so there were definitely more than 9 people sharing 2 bathrooms.  Besides sharing the bathroom, we had no major issues."

3898015,94454093,2016-08-15,30364306,Katariina,"Huone oli siisti ja Ari oli todella avulias ja huomioonottava isäntä. Vaikka hän ei ollut fyysisesti paikalla, kommunikointi hänen kanssaan sujui todella sujuvasti. Sijainniltaan Allston oli meistä kaupunkimatkailuun hieman haasteellinen, koska ei ole Metro-linjan vieressä ja julkisilla liikkumiseen meni siksi liikaa aikaa."

The actual room is fine, it's a basic room with a shared bathroom between 3 other bedrooms.  The location is good for parking and it is off the main stretch so it's quiet.   I would not recommend this for an extended stay. For us, it worked well to get to/from main downtown for the weekend."

She was easy to get a hold of when we made it into Boston, provided information via telephone for parking lot suggestions & any additional information we needed to know about the condo.  There was a welcome book in her home with everything you need to know about the condo along with information about the area which included a map of the subway.  Her home was immaculate & exactly as described in her listing.  She was so welcoming to the point that she left wonderful goodies for us to enjoy.  Everything is available in the condo from pots & pans to two different coffee machines (with a variety of coffees to choose from), wine glasses, toaster oven, micro, wash cloths, soap & pretty much anything you would need while at a getaway home.The location is convenient to almost everything by foot.  The building and the surrounding area is very quiet considering you're only steps away from the State Building, Faneuil Hall, Aquarium, Boston Common, etc.  My guests & I were very pleased with the entire process, the visit to Boston & the ease of communication with our hostess.

We had everything we ever needed and more. It was within walking distance to any major sites. In addition, Brynn’s flexibility and hospitality made our first airbnb experience so wonderful. If you are even considering this place, it is a must-do when in Boston."
8704161,75948669,2016-05-23,62470331,John,"We had a wonderful long weekend in Boston thanks in no small measure to Brynn and her lovely Beacon Hill apartment.  My wife and I shared the apartment with our seven-year old daughter and my wife's parents, and the upstairs/downstairs layout was perfect.  The apartment is beautifully appointed and stocked (with, naturally, linens, towels, soap, kitchen wares, etc., but also with games, exercise equipment, music and wine) and is very comfortable.  It is a three-minute walk to the T, Boston Common, Whole Foods, drug stores, a wine store and a variety of bars and restaurants, and is within easy walking distance of the North End, Charles Street, the Public Garden, etc."
Brynn could not have been easier to work with.  She was out of town while we were there but very easy to communicate with via text,phone and e-mail and was incredibly responsive.  She answered all our questions and was a wonderful host,making us feel as though the apartment were ours during our stay.

From her prompt and detailed responses to my questions before our visit, to the nice touches of fruit and bread in the kitchen, our stay was one of the most comfortable that I've experienced.  Her condo is beautiful - lots of space for me and my three guests.  The bathrooms well appointed and the deck outside was a beautiful addition - spent both mornings having breakfast outside enjoying the birds and rising sun.  I would definitely return to Brynn's condo when I'm back in Boston and I highly recommend anyone with a group or just a couple looking for a comfortable and special weekend away.  Thank you Brynn!"

The place was a few minutes walk to the T stop, a 10 minute walk to the financial district and maybe a 15 minute walk to the waterfront. The unit itself is huge. I was in Boston with a colleague on a business trip and we had plenty of room to not trip over each other. One bedroom is downstairs with a huge full bathroom. The other bedroom is on the main floor with a full bathroom - although a bit more tight than the downstairs bathroom. There's a patio that was quite lovely as well. The beds are super comfy but unnaturally high - I'm 5'3\"\" and I always had to jump onto the mattress. The unit is on the 2nd floor and the stairs up are narrow - which I think adds to the charm but would be something to consider for older guests. I definitely would stay here again!\""

It is only a couple of minutes' walk down Centre St. from the very nice commercial strip and major bus lines, and only a few minutes further away from the T. The unit is in a secure and well kept building and is beautifully furnished, with a comfortable bed and seating, and excellent appliances and amenities.

The building and neighborhood feel very safe and are relatively quiet (you do hear your upstairs neighbors which is expected in an apartment building).  The location is super-convenient to great JP restaurants, shops, the bus and the subway.  Private parking is an added bonus. Key hand-off and logistics were easy and communications with Eran responsive.  All in all, a great experience. Will stay again."

The location was ideal, a short walk into town where we were greater with amazing shops, restaurants, ice cream, coffee, and friendly neighbors. Everything was walking distance and it was a beautiful area to walk around at any time of day or night. The subway was a few blocks away as well as the bus line. Eran and Michael were wonderful hosts, very accommodating, and their apartment was spotless and gorgeous. There was plenty of space, comfortable sleeping accommodations, and private parking as well. The hosts were even kind enough to mail me my belongings that I happened to forget in their apartment upon our departure. Couldn't have asked for better hosts or a better place to stay. I would love to come back again!"

He's been a responsive host, he was available for our questions. After all, we did not have many since all the instructions were very well explained beforehand."
The apartment itself is quite spacious,and it had all we needed. It was clean,neat and practical. The bed was comfortable (as good as ours at home :)).,,,
It is easily accessible by subway,roughly 10 mins of walking. The neighborhood appeared to be welcoming and historical. We loved to see all those beautiful houses while walking to subway. We enjoyed the people wishing us Bon Voyage after seeing us walking with our luggage. Only not so good thing was the slopped walking path from subway to apartment. With our luggages,it was a bit difficult that we thought we should have called a cab. Maybe the bus drops off at a better location,we did not get a chance to try that during our 2 days stay.,,
Overall we had a very pleasant stay,we would highly recommend it to a couple,"(with a kid) is also possible since they a have couch in the living room. We would be happy to return here on our next visit to Boston.\"",,,

As for the neighborhood,JP is a great little town with a great vibe,and lots of good places to eat.

The apartment was very spacious for two people. The house manual they provided was detailed and helpful. Location was great. We drove so the parking spot on site was very convenient. It was only a 15 minute drive to downtown Boston. It was also close to Jamaica Pond. We spent one morning there and enjoyed the beautiful fall weather. The neighborhood is safe and the area is residential/family oriented. I would recommend this listing to my friends and would definitely stay again!

We have not met Eran and Michael but all the instructions given by email were very clear and easy to follow. We found the key hanging on the front gate, in safety in a locker, and we quickly settled into the apartment. Considerate, Eran and Michael had left us details about the nice places in the area, how to get to the subway and where go to eat . We had clean towels left on the bed as well as coffee, tea, cakes, cereals and bread left to our attention in the kitchen for breakfast. Everything was clean, comfortable, friendly and the apartment was exactly like on the photos! We had a great time and we found the neighborhood very nice, just half an hour from downtown by subway. We recommend the apartment of Michael and Eran without hesitation! :)"

Thank you, Eran & Michael, for a very comfortable & quiet stay! (And the DIY breakfast + chocolates. ) We loved the neighborhood & appreciated your helpful transit directions. We'd definitely stay here again. And if you like Ethiopian food, be sure to visit Blue Nile on Centre street nearby for dinner sometime. Yum."

1949996,38039046,2015-07-12,35246427,Sarah,"Eran's listing was just as it was described. It was very clean, and well taken care of. There were plenty of sheets, towels and anything else we needed. Also, a 10-15 walk to the T train and a 5 minute walk to the cute little downtown area in his neighborhood! Parking was also a great plus :)"
1949996,39803896,2015-07-26,11128477,Wenda,"Eran was very helpful to me prior to my arrival.  He responded to my emails quickly and provided great information.  I arrived to a bowl of chocolates and a very clean and neat apartment.  I tried several of the restaurants Eran recommended and also took a walk around Jamaica Pond, which is absolutely beautiful.  I was in town for a workshop and walked everywhere, love the town of Jamaica Plain and appreciated the laid back feel of a town so close to Boston!  I was traveling alone and felt 100% safe at all times.  It was a privilege to have such a wonderful home to stay in during my visit to Jamaica Plain.  I would highly recommend it!"

1949996,41828439,2015-08-09,16220985,Alexandre,"We had a very nice stay at Eran's place. It was very easy to get to. The place was (as advertised) clean and tidy. Despite that we didn't meet him, Eran was always available to answer our questions before and during the trip. The neighborhood in Jamaica Plain is very calm and quiet (and I'm quite picky about that). The place is a little far from inner Boston, but you have easy to reach common transportation, and if you have a car, Eran also have a parking place so there is no problem to move around."
"A very nice place overhaul.\"",,,,,
1949996,44948914,2015-08-30,39866956,Liz,This was a great apartment in a perfect location. We were easily able to visit the pond and arboretum as well as all the great restaurants and coffee shops that JP has to offer. The apartment was clean and spacious and just how Eran described. A great stay!

1949996,59936476,2016-01-17,32979920,Xiaoxiao,"Eran's apartment is just as described, if not better. The one-bedroom apartment is spacious and clean! My friends and I had wonderful three nights. Our travel was so exhausting, but the apartment offered us the best nights to restore. We took bus to downtown areas, and we only had to walk for three minutes to get to the bus stops. It's really convenient! Also I want to add that from the decorations in the apartment, we can see the owners embrace different cultures (we were so surprised and excited to see a Chinese painting!) They are such fun and interesting people. We wish them a even more fascinating year in 2016!"
1949996,65328950,2016-03-13,48438284,Michelle,Perfect space for what we needed!  It was 1 block from friends we were visiting in JP and was walking distance to downtown JP and easily accessible to public transportation for downtown Boston. I stayed with my two young children (age 4 & 6) and they were nice enough to put a fold-up mattress on the floor so the 3 of us could all sleep in the bedroom together. Space was super clean. Felt right at home! Off street included parking a huge perk. Highly recommend this space!

8518091,54416590,2015-11-19,27163432,Vince,"The listing description was accurate. Audrey was out of town during my one night stay so I coordinated my trip with Josh, whom I only met when I was leaving the next morning. He seemed really nice and took the time to ask a little about me and my experience in Boston."

14072546,91042112,2016-08-03,26173947,Chelsey,The room was one of three. Nice living room area and kitchen. Very close to the subway line in east Boston and one stop away from the airport. Nice neighborhood and a good value.
14072546,91245170,2016-08-04,23752847,Michael,"Room is exactly as described. Perfect for a layover.  Not very private, as you are sharing space with others in the townhouse, but each room has a door that locks with it's own set of keys.  Good restaurants within walking distance. Good value for the price.  Internet worked well."
14072546,92121007,2016-08-07,51221387,Péter,"Everything was alright with the apt. It was in a good neighborhood, market and laundry in front the apt. It was easy to find the house.

location,just blocks from Maverick T Station. When I first arrived I was a little unassure of the neighborhood,but the folks were friendly late at night and in the morning during our walks.  The heat was unbearable in the city but the room had its own air conditioner,"which made the night sleep way more enjoyable. The listing showed and listed the amenities.

14072546,95070176,2016-08-18,15463673,Gene,"This place was great. Every thing that you need is available. It's like a luxury hostel with a private room. The only issue was that necessary information wasn't directly shared once you reserved the room, such as which floor the room was located (the building has 3 floors) and the front door code. However the communication was perfect and extremely helpful. Also the location was great, Maverick station is about a 5 minute walk. The airport is extremely close, my flight was at 5:50 and I left the place around 4 and I was at my gate at 4:30. Overall, this place was perfectly convenient and would definitely stay again."

She met us at her place, showed us which keys to use, and wished us a good stay. Her place is located directly by a subway/streetcar stop which was very convenient. She is also located right beside a restaurant and a cafe, and just down the street are some more stores. Her place has no AC but there is a large fan in the bedroom which helped us cool off.

We loved the area. was right next to the Brigham Circle stop on the green line. Has a really convenient and close coffee shop that makes great breakfast and a really great restaurant the Mission Grill right down the block. A wonderful grocery store right down the street and very walkable. We had a car and was able to find parking during the night time, but most parking in this area is 2 hour parking during the day.

The apartment is very well located and recommended especially for travelers. Directly opposite is a tram stop and in the immediate neighbourhood are many restaurants and a supermarket. The apartment is very convenient. The bed is cozy and you can watch DVDs in the bedroom. A selection of DVDs was kindly provided. Unfortunately, the TV in the living room was not working. Otherwise, the apartment is as described and depicted in the photos. As Emily said before the apartment could use some improvements, but for a few days it was really ok.

6834270,73086488,2016-05-06,34955458,Jennifer,"Veronica was very welcoming and easy to communicate with! I'm am familiar with Boston and this is your typical apartment for this area. Kitchen was well equipped and the apartment was clean. Bed was very comfortable, except for the wooden panels that held the mattress up, that would occasionally fall out of place. The Green T coffee shop next-door is a fantastic place to go for coffee and breakfast! The Green-line T (E train) runs right past the apartment so it's easy to get just about anywhere in Boston."
6834270,75469288,2016-05-21,39773050,Matt,We really enjoyed the apartment and the city of Boston.
Veronica did a great job of informing us of all the important areas near the apartment and the best ways to use transit around town. (It's right in front of a green line stop,we used it every day to get around the city),,,,
Apartment was clean,safe and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again.,,,,

We had a large party -- eight people -- and the host was very helpful in making sure our stay easy, comfortable and fun. He was generous with restaurant suggestions and logistical advice, and gave easy instructions for organizing our stay. In terms of communicating, he was both responsive to questions and proactive with assistance."
The home itself is warm,beautiful,and located in a charming neighborhood. Getting in and out of Boston took 25-30 minutes by car,but that was only relevant once,as our group was more interested in the nearby restaurants,pond

4526315,25711137,2015-01-24,4331742,Anne,"Jared and his family are terrific!  You could not ask for more responsive and accommodating hosts.  We traveled to Boston with our one year old daughter and the house had everything we needed - Jared even brought toys for her up from the basement for us - she loved them.  The house is lovely and has some beautifully remodeled bathrooms.  The kitchen had everything we needed and then some, they have every kitchen gadget and appliance you could ask for and we had a great time cooking.  The house is in a great location in JP with easy access to everything.  We truly could not have asked for a better stay.  These folks and their house get five stars!"
4526315,29559862,2015-04-09,28717720,Nicole,"We could not have asked for a better host than Jared and his family. They helped from the very beginning with informing us on the neighborhood and the surrounding areas. He sent us lists of restaurants and take out areas and even split them up with ratings. Throughout our trip we were even able to contact Jared with any questions about our stay. The house is on an extremely quiet street and right across from a beautiful pond. The inside of the house is BEAUTIFUL. It was fully insulated so we had peace and quiet on each floor, given their are three floors we were surprised how quiet the rooms actually were. We had three kids and there was such an abundance of toys for them that they never ran out of things to do. Everything was there for us and we could not have been accommodated more than we were during this week. We lucked out so much with this house and would not change anything about our experience. Trust me, you will not be disappointed renting this house, with these owners you can not go wrong. We will be back"
4526315,29967492,2015-04-15,5261519,Caroline,"This is one of our best airbnb experience, from the first inquiry to our departure, it has been a real pleasure to communicate with Jared."
Everything about this place make it just perfect! The house is located in a great neighborhood,easy access to public transport with nice cafés,restaurants and grocery stores.,,,
The house itself is beautiful and very comfortable,we were a large family of 7 and everybody had their own space. Large rooms,comfortable beds,pillows,good quality sheets,towels and supplies. Really a fantastic place to stay.

We had everything we needed and Jared made sure we were provided with everything (bedding, towels, kitchen utensils, bathing products, and so on). He kept in touch and checked on us every once in a while and respected our privacy. I am definitely staying in this wonderful house again whenever I am back to Boston. The location of the house, right in front of Jamaica Pond is absolutely gorgeous."
4526315,32460690,2015-05-18,22224553,Kim,I rented this location for 5 days with my family for my daughter's graduation.  The house has everything you need and make you feel just like your own home very comfortable!

4526315,32962589,2015-05-24,27435385,Gil,"We loved the kids room and the toys were an instant hit. Coffee for 5 worked out to the last serving after 3 mornings. The house was roomy, clean, and well appointed. Back yard was a nice additional living room on pleasant evenings. The quiet cul-de-sac was an added bonus. Highly recommend this location for easy access to Boston and east Cambridge without the hustle bustle."
4526315,35541461,2015-06-20,5803592,Stephanie,"Ten members of our family spent a week in Jared's lovely home--six adults, two teenagers, and two little kids. The house was roomy enough for everyone, and we all found our favorite things. (My mom really loved the side porch/sunroom; I was particularly fond of the lights strung in the backyard; the little kids enjoyed the many toys and books about.) We were all so, so sad to leave."
The house is in a very quiet area--tucked away on a short street. The pond is very close,with Centre St. in Jamaica Plain a pleasant half mile walk away. Getting to the nearest T stations (on the Orange Line) required a little more than a mile's walk. We loved the old,beautiful houses of JP,so we took a slightly different route each time. (And frequently stopped on Centre St. for a bite to eat to break up the walk.),,
Jared was a fantastic host--responsive and gracious. He left thoughtful instructions on each room,and seem genuinely unperturbed by my incessant text messages on the day we arrived and settled in. He always answered every question promptly and in lots of detail,"often anticipating things I hadn't yet thought of. He was a pleasure to rent from.\"",,,

Very easy to get into and out of Central Boston (via Metro).  The area the house is situated in, is very quiet and peaceful with a lovely big Pond nearby.  The Hosts  and Anna (the cleaner) made our stay very enjoyable.  We would HIGHLY recommend staying here."

Джареда мы не видели, но он всегда был на связи по телефону, если у нас возникали вопросы. Уютный район с прудом и разнообразными ресторанчиками, которые также посоветовал Джаред. До центра Бостона 15 минут на машине. Общественным транспортом мы не пользовались."

4526315,53828931,2015-11-13,13482197,Barbara,Jared was a very welcoming and helpful host.  We felt right at home immediately.  A box of cookies was especially nice to arrive to -  as was a 'starter' box of Keurig coffee thingies.
Jared was attentive without intrusive and took care to respond to a small bathroom sink issue quickly with the attention of his local help.,,,,,
Helpful notes about care of this lovely home in beautiful Jamaica Plain were kindly written and also helped us to appreciate what were important factors.,,,,,

4526315,69255398,2016-04-10,60343309,Lisa,"I booked Jared's beautiful home on behalf of 4 of my colleagues who were in Boston for a business trip. Jared was a fantastic and attentive host. He was quick to respond to any questions the team or myself had. My colleagues were blown away by the home, it was immaculate and just as the photos described. Jamaica Plain is a beautiful area and it is well serviced by Uber which was really helpful for our team. I would definitely recommend staying at Jared's home and can only hope that I have the opportunity to stay there in the future."
4526315,71301488,2016-04-24,10867366,Beth,"What a special place! Anyone who stays here will find themselves very fortunate. Jared was completely available to answer all our questions. He was also flexible when we asked about checking in early (which in the end we didn't)  and leaving a little later (which we did). We found the key he left and found a beautiful home precisely the way we expected. There were nine of us staying there and it was great that we all had our own space and there was lots of room to relax.  The home is very clean, the beds were ALL very comfortable, and the kitchen is very well equipped. We were able to prepare anything we wanted. A special bonus was watching the robins, blue jays and cardinals. The home felt pastoral even though we were in Boston. Being able to stay at Jared's house helped make our family reunion a success and everyone enjoyed. Thank you Jared."
4526315,74435916,2016-05-15,44621546,Margot,We enjoyed our stay at Jarrods home in Jamaica Plain. It was very close to a beautiful pond and park. And a nice walk into town. Everything was at our fingertips. We enjoyed a lovely weekend with family for Boston University's graduation. Jared was a helpful and gracious host. You would be hard-pressed to find a more hospitable environment to spend time with family.
4526315,76043890,2016-05-24,48240931,Catherine,"Jared left very specific check in instructions and everything was exactly as described for us to park, get in the house, etc.  The house is easily accessed off a main road, but the street is quiet with minimal traffic.  We stayed with three generations of family attending a college graduation, and everyone was very comfortable with the bedrooms and common spaces.  The kitchen was well-equipped for the meals we prepared there and we spent a lot of time gathered around the large dining room table.  We are sad that we discovered this place since our trips to Boston will now be much less frequent."
4526315,78237389,2016-06-05,4190558,Tapasya,Jared is wonderful and this house is beautiful. We stayed here for a family reunion and enjoyed cooking and grilling here. The house is also very comfortable and well-designed. Highly recommend for your next stay!

4863108,30380578,2015-04-21,26566942,Maya,I ve recently visited Boston with my bf and we were hosted by John( his brother was away). He was very nice and friendly and made our stay very pleasant and comfortable.
The apt was clean,we stayed in a small room with the queen size bed but had an acces to all parts of the apt so it felt pretty homie.,,,,
The neighborhood is old but interesting- so rounded with trendy,cool bars and restaurants and also has a pretty easy acces to the downtown area.,,,,
All in all we had a good time staying with John,"I would gladly recommended.\"",,,,
4863108,31705673,2015-05-09,28762241,Sina,"John and Dan are two very nice, friendly and helpful guys. The whole apartment and my room were very nice! Also the location was pretty good for reaching the seaport area (on foot) as well as the downtown area (by T or bus). Overall I had a very pleasant stay and can definitely recommend Jon and Dan! Thanks, guys!"
4863108,32124443,2015-05-14,21465771,Lauren,We had a great experience at John's place! John was extremely professional and respectful. He answered any questions that we had and was very flexible with our check in and check out. Would definitely stay again!

It's a very clean apartment,with a big kitchen,good wifi and the opportunity to do laundry. I did not meet John or Dan,but they answered all questions very fast and checkin/out was easy.,,
"I would definitely stay there again.\"",,,,,
4863108,34490680,2015-06-08,10552395,John,"The hosts, John and Dan, were prompt, efficient and friendly.  The neighborhood is great, low key, a mile or so walk from downtown Boston and close to a couple of good restaurants."
4863108,35366309,2015-06-18,27643988,Lyndsay,"The house was ideal for our 7 night stay in Boston.  It was close to the BCEC (Boston Convention and Exhibition Centre) and handy for the T (transport system) with the No.9 bus stop just around the corner, which linked to the underground trains."
Nearby were some good places to eat. We particularly liked Lincolns,and Shennanigans was good too (although our waitress was lackadaisical the front-of-house lady was superb). There was a great mini-market called Foodies on Broadway too.,,,,
"We would stay again. \"",,,,,
4863108,36101805,2015-06-25,157319,Brendan,"Great location, communication, coordination, and value.  Can't ask for much more from an Airbnb host."
4863108,37600320,2015-07-08,36499913,Daniel,"John and Dan were great hosts even though I didn't get to meet them in person! John was very easy to get hold of through email/text. The room was perfect for my girlfriend and I. Also, the lounge area and kitchen downstairs were available to us as well. Great location, will book again!"
4863108,37988009,2015-07-12,26259047,Sabine,"De communcatie met John en Dan verliep heel vlot via email. De ontvangst door John was heel hartelijk en de incheck was heel flexibel. De ligging is fantastisch. Als je niet opziet tegen een fikse wandeling kan je alles te voet doen. Onze kamer was wel zeer klein. Het 1-persoonsbed was zeer comfortabel, het uitklapbed wat minder. De keuken was ook heel praktisch en aangenaam."
4863108,39600729,2015-07-25,11446717,Elina,The apartment was very clean and convenient with a nice kitchen equipment. Exactly as describe. Dan's friend came to let me in and explained me everything necessary and made me feel welcome. The neighborhood was  peaceful.
4863108,40424097,2015-07-31,24832961,Pierre,"Nous avons passé 6 jours très agréable chez Dan et John. Le quartier est calme et les maisons très mignonnes. Nous avons eu accès à la cuisine qui est parfaite, le piano fait rêver, ainsi qu à la pièce à vivre et la climatisation etait bien agréable par la canicule. Nos hôtes étaient absents mais  ont répondu très rapidement à nos diverses questions. Nous aurions aimé les rencontrer. Nous recommandons ce logement."

4863108,41756283,2015-08-09,34379315,Clara,"What a great stay at Dan's house ! The room is clean and comfortable as the kitchen, the private bathroom and the living room. The house is located near the subway (10minuts) which is very useful to go downtown. Dan is very kind and helpful. We recommand him !"
4863108,43630474,2015-08-21,36550391,Ivan,The description and pictures were accurate. The place was clean and you'll have access to your own bathroom. Close walk to the T Subway and the area is quiet and residential. Hosts were flexible with check in/check out times which made it easier for me to take advantage of my time in Boston. Highly recommend staying with them.
4863108,44651699,2015-08-28,37151903,Flo,"Dan was away from town while I was visiting,  but he ensured that everything was set. The house was clean and welcoming, and the bed was comfy too.   Thanks,  Dan!"
4863108,45372911,2015-09-02,34930799,Katharina,"Leider konnten wir Dan nicht persönlich kennenlernen, da er beruflich außerhalb der Stadt war. Er war aber über Mail gut zu erreichen und es war gut organisiert. Zimmer und Bad waren sehr klein, aber für unseren kurzen Aufenthalt von zwei Tagen ausreichend. Die Küche dagegen war ausreichend Großbank und mit allem ausgestattet was man zum kochen braucht."
"Die Lage ist sehr gut sowohl Stadt als auch Strand waren gut zu Fuß erreichbar. \"",,,,,
4863108,45561132,2015-09-04,1576866,Pierre & Anne,"Dan was away for business , so we did not have the opportunity to meet. The little house was very nice and very clean, but the room definitely too small for 2 persons. The comfort of the one single bed was moderate (bed made a lot of noise) and the sofabed totally unconfortable and the room to small . Bathroom was very nice. Allthough this we enjoyed Boston (great whale watching and lobsters ;-) ) The house is well situated, only 6 to 8 dollars to town center with Uber taxi."
4863108,46120499,2015-09-08,17327714,Katharina,My friend and I had a great time in Boston! Although we didn't meet Dan and John the check-in/check-out worked out really well.
There are two rooms of which we had the (pretty) small one and we had also access to the living room and the kitchen. Our room had a single bed and a pull out sofa. However neither of us did sleep on the sofa because the head piece was too hard to sleep on. Maybe it was only because we did put it up the wrong way but there was not really another alternative. So the sleeping situation wasn't ideal as we both had to sleep in the single bed.,,,,,
The location was pretty good as you have the red line to get directly to the city center and you have a supermarket nearby.,,,,,
"All in all we had a nice stay.\"",,,,,
4863108,46465905,2015-09-11,23773029,Jeffrey,"Dan has made checking in and out very easy and flexible. The apartment is located in a very convenient area, with quick access to the T and BCEC (a 15-minute walk)."
4863108,48285516,2015-09-25,3271356,Jenny,"Dan haben wir leider nicht getroffen, war aber ein netter, erreichbarer online Kontakt."
Das Einzelzimmer ist kleiner als gedacht und für zwei Personen nur bedingt zu empfehlen. Das single Bett ist schmal und sehr weich,das Futon Bett an einem Ende einfach ein Brett mit etwas Schaumstoff drüber.,,,,
"Abgesehn davon ist die Wohnung sehr sauber und angenehm. \"",,,,,
4863108,48530132,2015-09-27,35369670,Emily,We had a fab stay in Boston! Was awesome to be so at home and welcome in Dans house. He was very helpful via email as he had to be away for work. We had a bit of difficulty finding the place but once there the house was just as described in the listing. Lovely and quiet neighbourhood and just a 30 minute walk into town. The bed was a little squeaky and the futon a bit hard but we were aware of this and the room was perfect for what we needed.. Somewhere to sleep at the end of a full day exploring! Thanks for a great stay!
4863108,49192543,2015-10-01,12804538,Matt,"My experience was fairly positive. I arrived at Dan's past midnight due to a late arriving flight into Boston. Finding his house was pretty easy despite the 30 minutes it took to find a parking spot. There are no lights on his street and none were left on in or at the house so I fumbled around quite a bit to figure out how to get in and where my room was. Once I figured that out, everything went pretty well. The room is small, but clean. The bed isn't very comfortable and very loud. I would suggest it is great for a one night crash pad for one person, but I wouldn't stay there any longer or with more people than that."
4863108,49879130,2015-10-07,34506283,Heather,"I didn't get to meet Dan because he was out of town with work but the process of collecting keys was very easy and the place is just like the photos.  The bed was a little squeaky but I still got a good night's sleep, and the extra blankets provided weren't needed.  The shower had lots of hot water and the kitchen appeared to be fully equipped, although I didn't use it.  I was there from Monday to Wednesday and there was very little noise from outside, although I can't speak to what it's like at the weekend.  The double bedroom is upstairs from the single bedroom and I could hear the people staying there moving around, but I think they were wearing their shoes, which the guest sheet requested not to be done."
"All in all I was very happy with my stay here and would certainly come back again!\"",,,,,
4863108,50612557,2015-10-13,30597119,Lauri,Although the host was away I felt very welcomed through emails.  The listing was more than accurate.
"Highly recommended\"",,,,,
4863108,52347214,2015-10-28,45996317,John,"Simple room, perfect for a quick overnight trip.  The host was VERY accommodating as I didn't get into town until nearly midnight.  Made sure I was able to have access to the room and was very responsive."
4863108,53133580,2015-11-05,3977021,Mahdad,Short pleasant stay. Room was as described and Dan was very helpful

"No issues of any kind and easy and smooth communication.\"",,,,,
4863108,53883196,2015-11-14,42107263,Matthew,Dan provided a great place for us to stay while we checked out Boston. The condo was super neat and very easy to get to places via public transport. Also the condo was close to groceries and heaps of places to eat and drink. We had a great time in Boston due to how smoothly our stay went at Dans place.
4863108,54023518,2015-11-15,6671784,Lucas,Place was great! Dan was easy to communicate with and accommodating.

4863108,54571126,2015-11-22,33007278,Marcus,"I thought the room and neighborhood was really clean. All the necessary bedding was provided. Dan was out of town for work but he was always available thru mobile. Everything went right. There's also a kitchen available with all the necessary utensils, pots, pans, etc."
The neighborhood seemed pretty safe.,,,,,
I highly recommend,"especially for the price. I would rent again.  \"",,,,

4863108,57680679,2015-12-28,6763839,Selina,"My friend and I, we really enjoyed our stay in Boston. Although it was only for 2 days, we got to see quite a few things. After a long day of sightseeing, we felt very comfortable in your house. It was nice and clean and we could relax while watching a movie on Netflix. The communication with Dan worked perfectly. Whenever we had any questions, he helped us straight away."
"Thanks very much for this enjoyable stay at your place. \"",,,,,
4863108,59464734,2016-01-11,2518839,Katie,"The room is different from the current photos (January 2016). Instead of the twin bed and couch, there is a double bed plus a desk and chair. I liked this new arrangement, and found the room very comfortable. The bathroom was as pictured."
I stayed at the listing for a conference and it was very easy to travel to and from the convention center. I walked most mornings,and took a cab back in the evening. The neighborhood is quiet,and although there was someone else staying in the upper room they didn't bother me at all.,,,
Dan was flexible with both my check in and check out time,and was very responsive when I had questions. I would happily stay here again for another convention in Boston.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4863108,60572413,2016-01-25,47029041,Elena,"We spent three nights at Dan's apartment and we really enjoyed the stay. The room was cozy and nice, the bed was a bit small but very comfortable. I really appreciated the warmth inside the house (it was snowing in Boston), the wooden  floor and the furniture which made it a very   pleasant place to stay in. We were also very happy with the apartment location, South Boston is a nice area, all the main  points of interest  are within  a easy reach, both by foot or by using the T red line. Dan  was also a great host, although we didn't meet him, he was always available by phone. On the whole, I suggest this place to everybody."
4863108,61027226,2016-01-31,28173055,Rob,Had a great stay in Boston at Dan's. Didn't get to meet him but his place was very well kept and in a great location for accessing the convention center. Will definitely keep his place in mind next time I am in Boston!
4863108,61668748,2016-02-07,38296522,Sammi,Dan was a great host. He was extremely communicative and ensured the check-in and out process was smooth. His place was conveniently located for South Boston and the Waterfront. It was a shame we didn't get to meet in person - hopefully next time! Cheers
4863108,63081661,2016-02-20,40720347,Sonia,Dan was accessible and responsive when we needed to finalize the details of our visit. He left clear instructions and nice recommendations of where to eat in the area.
4863108,65310065,2016-03-13,20845549,Koji,Dan was a great host and very kind. I could use his room smoothly because he always gave me quick reply.
His room was clean and nice.,,,,,
Bed was big and shower,desk towel,bathroom,kitchen,air conditioner all was clean and good.,
I stayed for business conference at Boston convention center.,,,,,
This apartment was 15 minutes walk from convention center.,,,,,
"There is supermarket and restaurant and cafe in five or six minutes walk. It is very nice place to stay.\"",,,,,
4863108,65940570,2016-03-18,154490,Michelle,Although we didn't personally meet Dan our communication with him was very easy. The house was in a great location. Very easy to get to all the best places from there.
4863108,66662867,2016-03-24,47327652,Sam,"The description was accurate.  Room was quite comfortable and the house and neighbourhood were quiet and relaxing - perfect for unwinding after a day at the convention centre (a delightful 20 minute walk away!). I did not have an opportunity to use the kitchen, but it was quaint and nicely appointed.  The iron+ironing board was a lifesaver when I needed to freshen up my outfit after unpacking."
The room did get quiet warm despite the thermostat being set at 72°F,it seemed as though the vents never stopped running.  I got up and adjusted the thermostat and it helped greatly,though I may have been in a thermostat battle with the folks in the upstairs suite...,,,
"Overall I'd recommend this place for future conference goers as it's a short walk to the convention cente and the neighbourhood is quaint and accessible.\"",,,,,
4863108,66963286,2016-03-25,11338714,Tom,"Great host. This place does a great job in all three of the things I care about: (1) fast communication, (2) easy key pickup, (3) great, easy wifi. Good show."

Dan was easy to reach, always answering any questions quickly, extremely accommodating and kind.   I really enjoyed coming back for a great nights rest after a busy day at the convention center (a short walk away - about 12/15 minutes)."
4863108,77958446,2016-06-04,14406796,Dan,"I was impressed by the responsiveness of Dan - and his brother, who lives nearby, with a couple of logistical issues. The place is very much as advertised, and in a pretty little neighborhood with some great restaurants nearby."

Good hot water. Seemed safe. I would recommend this place to anyone. You do need to expect to walk a bit, but buses and train systems are all accessible within about 1/2-3/4 mile (10-12 minutes) from lodging. The place itself was neat and clean."
4863108,84387539,2016-07-07,66273854,An,Dan is an amazing host. The room is extremely clean like hotels. I will definitely stay again. Thank you so much Dan.

I cannot vouch for Dan personally as I didn't get to see him -- he seemed to be out whenever I was in. However, the place was comfy and clean and we managed to sort everything out via messages, so I can definitely recommend to stay at Dan's place."

There are some good bars and restaurants around the house if you don't want to too far away to go out at night. I will certainly come back here when  I will go to Boston again!"
4863108,88897724,2016-07-25,78295034,Dana,Loved the room! Hope to book again in the future.
4863108,89794558,2016-07-30,57925859,Ashley,Dan was very flexible with check-in. The neighborhood was close to some younger hip restaurants/bars. People were nice in the neighborhood. Overall enjoyed our stay in Boston!!

4863108,90195069,2016-07-31,19133492,Camille,"Dan n'était pas présent durant notre séjour chez lui. La maison était cependant très propre et facile d'accès. Nous avons trouvé du stationnement sur la rue perpendiculaire et le métro n'est qu'à une dizaine de minute de marche, il faut compter environ 30 à 45 minutes pour se rendre à pied au centre ville."
4863108,91473844,2016-08-05,15142633,Anas,"Dan made us feel very welcomed initially by answering all our questions, offering help whenever we needed it, and providing information regarding nearby restaurants, transportation, accommodations ...etc. Dan was not in the house when we were there, however it felt as if he was there from his very efficient communication. The room was very clean as well as the whole house. He left us clean bed sheets, covers and towels. The kitchen, internet and other utilities were available to use as well. The location was great and within walking distance from Boston, quite to stay in yet very active and full of life."
4863108,92653159,2016-08-09,78487696,Christina,"The room was comfortable and clean.  We did not spend much time there as we were enjoying Boston and sightseeing during our stay.  It was very convenient to the subway which was awesome.  Nice local restaurants and really anything you needed nearby.  Dan allowed us to drop luggage before check in and leave luggage after check out which was great!  Dan checked with us to make sure we got checked in and out successfully.  He was easy to reach if we had any questions.   All went really well.  The neighborhood felt really safe.  I was glad that we arrived in the day light.  When we returned later that night we thought it would have been tricky to find the unit for the first time in the dark, as it is tucked back on a tiny street that was not super well lighted.  That posed absolutely no problem, just something to be aware of.  I would definitely stay at Dan's place again and recommend it highly."

Keeping in touch with us daily to offer assistance made us feel very relaxed around Boston. We will definitely plan to come back in the future and will recommend your place to everyone."
A big TX Thank You,,,,,

6075932,30838411,2015-04-27,19233175,Makoto,"Milicent was very kind and a caring host. Overall, the apartment is exactly as is advertised -- the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was clean too.  Notably, it is located in a safe and quiet neighborhood - it's just a few minutes walk from the Back Bay Station!  If I were to visit Boston again, I would stay in Milicent's place. Thank you!"
6075932,31542975,2015-05-06,31535924,Jose,"\"I had a wonderful stay at Milicent's. She is a very kind and friendly host and always made sure I had a comfortable stay. Her apartment truly is a piece of \"\"South End Charm\"\" and the description is very accurate. It's clean"
6075932,31601588,2015-05-07,31525891,Leslie,"We really enjoyed our stay. Milicent was very nice to us. I love the apartment, it is in a lovely neighborhood with great convenience. Very closed to restaurants and train station. I also like the fact that we can keep the restroom to ourselves, it is just right next to the bedroom. The bedroom is not big, nor is the bed. But is good enough for me and my husband."
6075932,31735559,2015-05-09,7224065,Meibel,Milicent was an amazing host; she gave us a lovely welcome to her truly beautiful home. The flat is wonderfully quirky with an amazingly comfortable bed; a great nights sleep.
Milicent was very helpful with tips on how to get around Boston and what to see. She made our stay very easy,would love to come back and stay again.,,,,
"Thank you\"",,,,,
6075932,32263763,2015-05-16,2504940,Clara,"We had a great experience at Milicent's. The apartment is beautiful and in a great location. We had a private room (with a great bed!) and bathroom, and we could also use the living room. That was great! And Milicent was really nice. She gave us lots of useful tips for places to eat and things to do! We'd definitely stay there again!"
6075932,32616358,2015-05-19,30213013,Myriam,"Milicent gave us a warm welcome. Her place is lovely, quiet, well-located,and clean. We were only there for one night but it was just as described and just what we needed. Thanks!"
6075932,33274977,2015-05-26,10247906,Jewel,"Beautiful house, great location and sweet host. Nora the pet rabbit is also awesome."
6075932,33683974,2015-05-31,30931914,Ashley,"Great neighborhood--so close to restaurants and public transportation. Though the space was part of an apartment, it felt as if I had my own apartment. The host was extremely friendly, accommodating, and helpful. Would definitely stay again!"
6075932,34003611,2015-06-03,32147842,Eric,Milicent was very friendly and accommodating! The apartment was clean and in a fantastic part of town. We easily saved over a hundred dollars just on uber rides because how centrally located we were. Definitely check out the art museum!
6075932,34431477,2015-06-08,1774903,Marie,"Milicent was such a gracious host; she had everything ready for us and met us at the house when we arrived. The house itself is just gorgeous, and having our own floor with a sitting room, patio, bathroom, and the softest bed comforter ever was just like having a private apartment. The neighborhood was astoundingly cute & felt super safe, and Milicent gave us excellent restaurant recommendations. I have visited Boston before and cannot imagine finding a better place to stay."
6075932,34711028,2015-06-11,8660818,Andrea,"Milicent's place is located in a fantastic neighborhood of Boston.  Everything is walking distance (cafes, bars, restaurants, tube), which is the best about the apartment. We haven't met Milicent in person, but the communication with her assistant Shimmy was great. She was very helpful and supportive. Besides that the experience was unfortunately not as desired - everything seemed a bit chaotic and unorganized. The Cleaniness could be improved as well."
6075932,34963999,2015-06-14,21829539,Janine,"We were delighted with this apartment, and its location.  We only stayed two nights so our sightseeing time was limited and found we were able to walk to shops, restaurants and historical places easily. Our bus into Boston arrived a little later than anticipated but Millicent's assistant was there to meet us and show us around the apartment, explaining how things worked and making sure we had what we needed.  Having access to a washer and dryer was very useful, as we'd been travelling a while and needed to catch up with our washing. I would stay here again if I had the opportunity to return to Boston."
6075932,35383136,2015-06-18,18134766,Edward,We arrived early and were very kindly met by Millicent's assistant. The apartment was fantastically located in a very safe and stunning location not too far from Newbury Street (very good shopping!). We were on the raised ground floor with a separate entrance to the other floors so it was private and we felt we had our own space. The bed was very comfy although the bathroom could have been a little cleaner. She let us borrow her washer and dryer as we had piles of washing from our travels. All in all a great stay and we would definitely come back!
6075932,35555203,2015-06-20,31526799,Emily,This was a great place to stay!  The neighborhood was lovely and very quiet at night.  There were great restaurants within short walking distance.  Our host was very friendly and offered some good suggestions for places to eat.  The bed was comfortable and space was just what we needed.
6075932,38385020,2015-07-15,30859615,Elaine,"Lovely little apartment in a great area.  We were made to feel completely at ease.  The space is separate from Milicent's which  gives a nice sense of privacy, although Milicent graciously answered any queries that we had."
We walked everywhere and found some lovely places to eat and drink both in South End (The Buttery for coffee and bagels and Picco for great pizza)and in the wider city. Lovely spot,"lovely hostess - would definitely recommend! \"",,,,
6075932,39747022,2015-07-26,31520110,Dominic,"Host wasn't there when we arrived, but she gave us clear instructions on everything. She told us to feel at home, which made us felt good!"
She is very helpful and knows all about the cool places in Boston.,,,,,
"Oh and the rabbit was fun.\"",,,,,
6075932,43573145,2015-08-20,9738192,Prashant,I arrived at Milicent's home around 9:30.  She was there and very inviting.  She even offered me dinner. Which was nice since I didn't have to immediately go out and find something to eat.
The neighborhood is very nice.  There is a Starbuck's within walking distance.,,,,,
I was only there for 2 nights and was out most of the day.  There was no TV,"but there was WiFi. So I just watched Netflix on my computer.  \"",,,,
6075932,44284779,2015-08-25,29406206,Charlie,"We found the location very convenient to transit and places to eat. Charming, quiet neighborhood. Thanks for the helpful books about Boston, as well as allowing us use of your refrigerator, washer/dryer, and hairdryer. A most comfy stay."
6075932,46614866,2015-09-12,27743675,Spencer,"My experience with Milicent was both professional and very personal. The first floor with bedroom, bath and living room were private and clean. It thought being in the middle of Boston would have some level of urban noise at night. The neighborhood of brownstones was immaculate, very quiet and has a small beautiful garden open to the public. Also, the location was terrific. This was a great experience."
6075932,48725753,2015-09-28,17152202,Stevie,"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time at Milicent's! She is very sweet and provided us with excellent suggestions for restaurants in the area (The Buttery in particular was delicious). The apartment was clean, bright, and conveniently located. I would absolutely stay here again!"
6075932,52057537,2015-10-26,1221721,Helen,"Millicent was a very friendly, responsive and flexible host.  Her apartment is in quite a lovely area--beautiful brownstones along a quiet tree-lined street with an attractive small park a few steps away. Go just a half dozen blocks and you are in the heart of downtown Boston with wonderful shops and restaurants.  The bed was full-sized and quite comfortable.  The bathroom needed some attention as the sink was not draining properly (my husband cleaned out the trap) and the shower head was not functioning well--only a weak dribbling stream.  The sitting area did not look like it did in the photos, as only the two chairs were there and not the nice couch or rugs or lamp or painting above the couch, making it much less inviting. But all in all, it was a good place to stay and met our needs for a good place to sleep at night."
6075932,68177667,2016-04-02,63144356,Joshua,"Clean, comfortable, great location, lovely hosts and a lovely home.  Very welcoming and engaging.  I wish I'd've stayed longer!  Would definitely recommend to my friends and family!"
6075932,70329884,2016-04-17,17149749,Ellen,"Milicent was,simply put, amazing. Incredibly accommodating and understand, she was so easy to communicate with and even offered to watch our pup during our prolonged stay. To say this was one of the best business trips because of her kind generosity is an understatement!"
"Will definitely be back!\"",,,,,
6075932,70793754,2016-04-20,17149749,Ellen,"Staying with Milicent in her guest room was a dream. It was quiet, private, and she and her partner were incredibly welcoming!"
"Thanks for making our stay so wonderful!\"",,,,,
6075932,72758898,2016-05-04,1544536,Leo,"Milicent was a great host, warm and friendly with good recommendations for local restaurants and getting around the area.  There were no worries about getting the key (we arrived at night) and Milicent was available for any issues.  We had one floor of Milicent's brownstone walk-up to ourselves including a bedroom, bathroom, and living room but no kitchen facilities beyond a refrigerator.  Milicent is upstairs and respected our privacy during our stay.  The bed is comfy, the bedroom roomy (with a nightstand and a table and a chair, and closet space with some hangers).  Centrally located in the south end, we walked to restaurants, cafes, shops, and the Hynes Convention Center.  We will come back here the next time we are in Boston."
6075932,79097613,2016-06-11,22812889,Ercenk,"Great location, amazing host. Thank you Milicent!"

6075932,91958293,2016-08-07,45360836,Karina,It was perfect. Awesome location. The room is what you  see in the picture. If you  want  to  experience  the  Boston lifestyle  this is the place. Militants was a great host!
6075932,95131854,2016-08-18,513401,Zoli,"Absolutely beautiful neighborhood, wonderful apartment (essentially a separate place) and the host could not be friendlier. Top notch!"

5511924,32346606,2015-05-17,15568806,Marcel,"Jema's apartment was spacious, and the room, bed and bathroom were nicely decorated, clean and comfortable."

5511924,33449112,2015-05-28,31725340,Jasmine,"Jema was a very welcoming host. She provides pick up service from the airport. The plane arrived 50 minutes before schedule. But she was able to follow the update and arrive before I exit from the airport. She also provided detailed instructions for going around town and destinations. She went her way to purchase 7 day bus pass for me. She provided free beverage, wine, milk etc in the fridge. She has classy furniture and supplies. Good location and walking distance to a lot of places."

There is a $60 cleaning fee, regardless of length of stay. The location is a bit far, but LYFT taxis came promptly and the bus is only two blocks away."
5511924,36143648,2015-06-25,36094285,Cory,"Jema was positively accommodating. She made space for me to safely park at night, kept the bedroom very clean with fresh linens, and overall made me feel very welcome. Possibly the best first AirBnB experience I could have had."

Jema was a wonderful host: very welcoming, easy to talk to, and helpful with questions about the city.  I was in Boston for a convention and I found the location to be ideal whether walking, driving, or taking the bus.  I also appreciated having a free place to park my car.

She was very helpful in letting me find the routes for different places in Boston. She endorses a beautiful clean house. The room is very comfortable. The wifi works very fast. She is respectful of her guest privacy. She completely made me feel like home. The most important feeling which i had at her place was that i felt safe and welcomed. I had a wonderful experience being at her place. The house, room, bathroom, kitchen and the location; everything is in order.

Unfortunately, I had to return home early, so wasn't able to make it, but my friends still stayed there. They absolutely loved it and said it was the best place they stayed on our trip"
7310887,47684587,2015-09-21,30153268,Nancy,It was a great experience we enjoyed staying at the house. It was a little farther from the city than we initially thought but not too bad. It was fine to get around on uber or the trains. Jacklyn was really nice & accommodating.
7310887,48407605,2015-09-26,31801282,Peng,It is really a fantastic experience to stay at Jacklyn's apartment!

Apart from the fact that the accommodation was equipped with all kinds of useful things (like charging cable, bathroom amenities, washing powder, Netflix-Account etc.) we always had the opportunity to ask for everything we need. The arrival and the key handover worked very easy. Based on the time of departure they were very understanding and flexible. We really felt at home! Thank you!"

7310887,51276256,2015-10-19,6620221,Jen,"The location of this apartment is fantastic -- an easy walk to local shops and restaurants and just a short ride on the T to downtown Boston. We found the apartment to be spacious, clean and well stocked with everything we needed to feel very much at home. Jacklyn was a thoughtful, communicative and welcoming host. We would highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a larger space in the Boston area."
7310887,51728281,2015-10-24,43472494,Marlène,Appartement spacieux et confortable. Bien situé au calme. Proche du metro.
A recommander pour un sejour à Boston.,,,,,
Accueil chaleureux et sympathique.,,,,,
"A notre disposition en cas de besoin.\"",,,,,
7310887,52315534,2015-10-28,41314444,Patrick,Great location. Short walk to local restaurants & bars. Felt like a very safe neighbourhood. Apartment itself ideal. Very clean with plenty extra towels etc. Apple TV. Beds very comfortable. Nice touch leaving welcome note with instructions & things to do. Free WiFi. Key waiting on arrival. Bathroom small but has everything you need. Would 100% go back if heading to Boston again.
7310887,52629189,2015-10-31,8385078,Ian,"Jacklyn was great. She went the extra mile to make us feel at home and ensure our stay was comfortable. The apartment was clean, sunny, and spacious. Would stay again."
7310887,52960553,2015-11-03,39605156,Julia,"This was our 1st experience with Airbnb and what an excellent one at that.  Our hosts Jacklyn and Joel were very accommodating and available for anything we needed.  The apartment was beautiful, very spacious and comfortable.  It was stocked with all room amenities and supplies.  We really felt like we were at home, it was just that comfortable plus extra touches like a bottle of wine and since we were there for Halloween, a cauldron of candy.  The neighborhood is quaint, family oriented and in walking distance to many restaurants and the T.  We didn't have to drive very much however parking was not an issue at the apartment as there is a driveway.  With having family in Boston, we look forward to returning soon and hope that we'll be able to stay again."
7310887,53461130,2015-11-09,42620040,Mike,Loved it.  It was perfect for our family's trip to Boston.  Would absolutely stay here again.
7310887,54105017,2015-11-16,4605678,Michelle,"We chose to stay at this apartment because it is close to Boston University where we were attending a conference. The apartment is so spacious and light but also cosy and inviting at the same time. It was really easy to get to from Logan airport, and even more so with the directions that Jacklyn gave us. I'm so glad that we chose to stay at Jacklyn and Joel's place because we felt right at home! The apartment was spotlessly clean - I can't fault it at all. Jacklyn even dropped by to check that we had everything we needed.  Contact with her and Joel was also always super easy. If I ever go back to Boston, I'll definitely stay here again."
7310887,54882234,2015-11-25,28591960,Jamita,"My family and I loved our stay at Jacklyn's. It felt like a home away from home and when we return to Boston, we will definitely return to this place."
7310887,55351086,2015-12-01,39981001,Sheree,"Jacklyn and Joel made us feel very welcomed to their home! Their home is beautiful, very comfortable, and well-supplied!  They even supplied us with extra baking dishes and a bottle of wine when they knew that we were going to cook our Thanksgiving meal in their kitchen! It was easy to find, easy to get the key and check out.  The beds were comfortable and beautifully made up, and we had a great time playing board games, watching movies, and perusing their book collection! It IS a sunny, spacious and very clean home!"
7310887,56614630,2015-12-15,49346053,Andy,"This was not a rental for me but for 3 of our foreign employees who were coming into Boston to meet at our office for 2 weeks. In any event, I was the one who made the reservation."
The house was in impeccable condition when I arrived a few hours before our employees to leave some breakfast food,and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Jacklyn and her husband had also left some food,"including a bottle of \"\"welcome wine\"\".   The beds were all good with folded towels left on each one. A spacious living room and dining room.  Everything very clean. Good WIFI",AppleTV,etc.  It's the kind of place anybody could feel comfortable staying in during an extended visit.,
Early into the stay,Jacklyn contacted me to tell she was offering an extra cleaning service mid-way through the stay,seeing as it was 2 weeks,and when would it be convenient for our guests? I like that she wanted to be helpful but not impose.,,
Also,although the dishwasher stopped working the day before our guests arrived,Jacklyn got it replaced very quickly and a new one was installed and functioning by the second day of our rental.,,,
The location of this home is very convenient.  Walk to the left or right of the house for five minutes and you get to an excellent supermarket (Whole Foods to the right,BFresh to the left).  Walk 5 minutes to the left and you are at the Green Line (B line) or at one of many bus stops on Harvard Avenue -- where you can get into downtown Boston in 20 minutes or Cambridge in 15. Walk 10 minutes and you are in the heart of Coolidge Corner in Brookline,where you can find a ton of sophisticated restaurants,or go 15 minutes and you are in the heart of student-oriented food and entertainment (including at least 1/2 a dozen live music clubs).,,
"You won't be disappointed staying here. \"",,,,,
7310887,57524406,2015-12-27,565507,Kim,"We stayed here for our Christmas holiday and it was wonderful! Boston is a great town and the location of Jacklyn and Joel's house is a short train or uber ride away from historic downtown Boston. We stayed with out two kids and having a large place to stretch out, be able to cook meals, do laundry etc was a great way to save money and travel light. The apartment is stocked with everything you need and Jacklyn is close by if you need anything. We will definitely be back!"
7310887,57905828,2015-12-30,43541255,Lisa,"The apartment is super comfortable, and very spacious. The beds were comfy with warm comforters and cozy furnishings. The street is a little busy for prepare for some city noise but it's a great location close to a lot of restaurants and shops. I would definitely stay there again."
7310887,59045578,2016-01-06,45618275,Alexander,Our family (3 adults and two kids 10 and 12 years old) had a chance to stay at the end of december 2015. It is really good location in Brookline (Boston)  - center of Boston is 20min by car. All were as expected inside the apartments (clean and comfortable). Even we have received a bottle of wine for our New Year celebration!!! Only positive impressions. Highly recommended !
7310887,59993208,2016-01-18,41136759,Maria,The apartment was very bright and clean - the location is excellent and very convenient as I had a rental car - the owners were very responsive when the dryer did not work and fixed it the next day
7310887,60706150,2016-01-26,1158879,Rowan,"I can't even describe how great our stay was at Jacklyn's place. Although I didn't get to meet Jacklyn myself, we emailed back and forth - communication was a breeze. The apartment was beautiful with so many things above and beyond what you would expect, from good quality utensils to coffee, tea and even wine :) I cannot recommend this place enough!"
"We were in Boston when there was a big snow storm... and woke up the next day and our car was dug out and ready to go. Just another awesome touch to a perfect stay. Thanks guys!\"",,,,,
7310887,61518469,2016-02-05,4710040,Matthew,"Jacklyn was a perfect host! We had immediate and thoughtful communications from her, and this lovely, well-located apartment was immaculately clean and well equipped. There were loads of fresh linen/towels, a full kitchen, and books and games to enjoy. Apple TV was a real plus. Brookline is an area where street parking can be tricky, so the driveway access was really beneficial. All in all, a terrific stay. We will be back!"
7310887,62033432,2016-02-10,54723812,Kitty,The apartment is great! My family spend the weekend there and loved it. The place is great for families. The host is very nice and helped us with TV setting.  I would choose this place again!
7310887,62737900,2016-02-16,40129965,Jodi,Jacket and Joel were great host during our stay in Boston. They responded to every inquiry quickly and were so helpful and accommodating. The house was the perfect location for a weekend in Boston to look at Boston university and Northeastern. It is exactly as pictured in the photos.
7310887,63259373,2016-02-21,46439229,Charlie,"This was my first Airbnb stay and I can say that it set the bar pretty high!  The Apartment is very spacious for a place so close to the city.  More than you need is provided with towels, kitchen needs ect.  The neighborhood feels safe and has good restaurants and a grocery all within a 10 minute walk.  Also two public transportation lines (trolleys) are within a 11 minute walk."
Never got to meet meet Jac and Joel but they were very responsive to my texts to help us out with local knowledge.,,,,,
I would not hesitate to recommend this as a relaxing place to spend a Boston vacation.,,,,,

7310887,64323234,2016-03-02,58010886,Stefano,"The house was clean, warm, and very spacious. The listening description was very accurate. The neighborhood was quiet yet close to many shops and restaurants.  We could not ask for anything more."

7310887,66467781,2016-03-22,58896969,Jiuhan,"Jacklyn and Joel are great hosts! Their place was very spacious in a quiet and convenient neighborhood. At one time, six people stayed in the apartment with one person slept on the big comfortable sofa. Communication was very easy and they accommodated all our needs. My family came to Boston for medical treatment from China, and this beautiful apartment and the gracious hosts made them feel like home away from home."
7310887,67477022,2016-03-29,32207681,Suzanne,"Our family of five stayed in the apartment for three days. It was perfect for our needs - spacious, comfortable, and clean. Jaclyn messaged me the day before with information on location and how to get in. They left nice touches like mints and water bottles and a welcome chocolate bar (kids were very appreciative), as well as a note with all the information we needed about wi-fi, tv, etc. It was a cold March weekend and it was easy to warm up the apartment as needed., plus there were cozy extra blankets and even sweatshirts for our use. The location is very convenient - Whole Foods a couple of blocks away and good access to services and transportation. We did have a car with us and utilized the driveway. We come to Brookline at least once a year to see my parents, and would definitely try to stay here again."
7310887,68280410,2016-04-04,40437630,David,"A bottle of wine, mints and beautifully arranged towels and water."

From the first email to Jacklyn and all those in between, she was so helpful & responsive. The apartment was so conveniently located, clean & cuter than I imagined-the photos don't give it justice. Joel paid a visit to chat & make sure everything was alright & wished me luck in my run! We had a great time and I would recommend this place to everyone. Definitely 5 stars!"
7310887,71449823,2016-04-25,21485606,Ian,"Our hosts were marvelous, and extremely accommodating when my plane landed far earlier than expected. They even made arrangements to store my luggage while the apartment was being cleaned, allowing me to tour the city at my leisure."
The apartment itself is delightful,the complimentary wine a wonderful surprise,and the neighborhood very walker/commuter friendly.,,,

7310887,74786851,2016-05-16,41471338,Claire,"Jacklyn and Joel were very welcoming with instructions emailed and texted to us so that there was no confusion. We were welcomed on arrival by Joel who told us where he would be if we needed anything extra and then in the apartment there was a lovely bottle of wine; very much appreciated after a long day of travelling. The apartment itself was exactly as described and definitely lived up to our expectations; very roomy even with 4 adults. There was extra everything, towels, shampoo, and a washer/dryer for those that prefer to travel light. Travel was easy as there was a T stop a leisurely 10 minute walk away; it runs from 6am to 12.30 which is great if you fancy a night out in Boston."
7310887,75301464,2016-05-20,26349328,Jonny,Jacklyn and Joel's home is a wonderful place for anyone thinking of visiting the boston area.
The home was very welcoming and clean when we arrived and the system in place was perfect if you're in a small group. We were able to move freely in and out of the house as we pleased without interrupting anyone else's plans.,,,,,
As well it was really nice to be in a home that offered such an easy access to downtown. As someone who didn't grow up with a lot of public transit I can find it confusing.  But this was a very simple train to the heart of downtown. And if you're not interested in that only short uber or cab ride.,,,,,
Also we had a confusion on our end with our travel plans and Jacklyn and Joel were very helpful in accommodating our needs. Very much appreciated.,,,,,
"Thank you again for such a wonderful trip!\"",,,,,

Joel came out to greet us right as we drove up, and he showed us around. It was exactly as described, clean and spacious, and they provided everything (and more) we might have needed. Each bed even had a bottle of water and a mint! The A/C units worked great, too, on the days when it was super muggy out, and the neighborhood was very convenient. Not located on a busy street, but the grocery store and lots of restaurants were still just a 10- to 15-minute walk away."
"Would definitely recommend staying here!\"",,,,,
7310887,78071978,2016-06-05,45598753,Kimberly,"Lovely place in a quiet, green neighborhood. Felt like a get away from the busy city. Spacious and well-appointed. The hosts were very responsive. Wine in the fridge and coffee pods beside a good machine were much appreciated. Small problems with slow draining sink in bathroom and water leaking out of dishwasher. Would absolutely stay here again!  Thanks!"
7310887,79011026,2016-06-10,64349708,Jeffrey,"Our host provided a well equipped kitchen, some food to get started and clean and welcoming place in general.  The room fans and air conditioners worked.  The neighborhood is safe, convenient to public transportation and Whole Foods. Corey road can be noisy, so you if your're a light sleeper, you will need to close the windows.  Walking around the neighborhood was pleasant and felt safe."

Sheets are clean and fit the bed.  We've been to other hotels that didn't come close, and some B and B s that skimped in this area. I'm very particular about cleanliness in the bathroom.  NO MOLD or stinkiness. Hooray!  In addition, they have many amenities which made us feel treated well--the wine others mentioned, Kurig coffee, tea, mints on pillows, shampoo and conditioner, body lotion, 2 choices of brand new toothbrush and toothpaste for my son who forgot his. The parking space is great, and though the house is close to the T we drove in to Boston to save time--very easy.  Lovely walk to downtown Brookline, which had good restaurants and shopping.  I would recommend this place to anyone and would definitely return!"

In the kitchen you can use a nice coffee machine, a toaster, there's a spacious fridge and freezer, and you can do your own cooking if you like.  There's a nice food store on walking distance, and also the subway is only a short walk away.  In the apartment you also find laundry facilities as well as a dishwasher.  Jacklyn and Joel were always ready to advice and assist.  We certainly recommend this airbnb to anyone visiting Boston."
7310887,87986432,2016-07-22,47150454,Tony,We sadly left this Airbnb yesterday - sad because we enjoyed the experience so much. A very well organized welcome greeted us along with a much appreciated bottle of wine and some water. One of the cleanest rentals that we have ever been in. We cooked in each night and never lacked for any utensil or vessel. The fact that we could walk less than 2 blocks to the Whole Foods made this perfect. We honestly couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thanks so much!

Fue muy útil el supermercado cercano, y disponer de todo lo imprescindible y algunos detalles, incluyendo café, una botella de vino, aceite, sal, azúcar... Lo imprescindible para poder prepararnos el desayuno en casa, e incluso cocinar después de algunas compras. Todo se ajustaba a la descripción, la casa, el barrio... y estuvimos muy cómodos. El tren estaba cerca, aunque el trayecto se hacía lento por las numerosas paradas, fue mucho más práctico desplazarnos con Uber, funcionó perfectamente. Jacklyn atendió todas las dudas que le planteamos, y nos facilitó toda la información que necesitábamos. Gracias por todo!!"

We found it very well positioned for the T into Boston. There's a good variety of eating  places at Washington Square which is a 15 minute stroll away. For a fantastic range of beers try the Scotch & Hops at Coolidge Corner.
Jacklyn and Joel were very responsive online before we arrived,"and Joel came up and saw us to check everything was okay. Highly recommended if you want to avoid staying downtown and want to experience a little of life in Brookland. \"",,,,
7310887,94088130,2016-08-14,17559004,Doug,"Jacklyn's place was perfect for our baseball weekend trip to Boston.  The apartment was spacious and had everything you could ask for. The apartment was very nice and in a great neighborhood. The apartment is walking distance away (5-10 minute) from a  Whole Foods and nice restaurants/bars. The T was about 5-minute walk and train ride to Fenway took about 20-25  minutes. Uber ride to and from the airport took about 30 minutes.  Jacklyn was very attentive and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. We did !!  She answered all questions we had in a timely manner. While the weather was extremely hot for our stay, Jacklyn's place was awesome to come home to.   If my travels ever take me back to Boston, I would not hesitate to stay here, if she would have us :)"
7310887,96304231,2016-08-22,13902332,Carsten,"We had a lovely five-day family vacation in the Greater Boston Area staying at Jacklyn and Joel's apartment. It's spacious, clean, comfortable, and stocked with all sorts of practical amenities that are really useful when you're away from home (like sandwich bags and extension cords!). There was convenient parking for our rental car in the driveway, a Whole Foods grocery store down the street, and plenty of restaurants nearby. Would definitely recommend!"
7310887,97199880,2016-08-26,32622785,J,Lots of WOW!
Jacklyn and Joel were great communicators from the very start.  The apartment description and pictures show you exactly what you get.,,,,,
They are kind and generous hosts and pay attention to the small details.  They gave us some great suggestions about what to see and where to go in Boston and always made sure that things were going well over our 5 day stay.,,,,,
The apartment was spotlessly clean on arrival.  The apartment is a pretty,gets lots of natural light,and is spacious.  There are lots of windows for cross ventilation and ceiling fans--given the moderate weather,we didn't have to use air conditioning during our stay.  It has a lot of living space: a full-sized kitchen with full-sized appliances,a real dining room,a large living room with a big-screen TV.  There's even a small pantry with a well-stocked Keurig coffee machine and a small washer/drier--key when you're traveling with a family of five and want to pack light.
The location couldn't be better.  You are walking distance from the restaurants and stores on Harvard St.,a big Whole Foods,and the Boston Transit green line that will take you to the heart of Boston.  Our car basically stayed parked in the driveway (yes! this Airbnb domes with off street parking,which is key when you're visiting a city) most of the time during our stay.,,
When you are traveling with a family of five,there are very few hotels that will can really accommodate sleeping arrangements for 5,where everyone actually gets to sleep in a bed.  And no hotels at this price that have this kind of living space or are this pleasant to stay in.,,,
We would definitely stay here again when we are in Boston.  This is a winning Airbnb,in a great location,with amazing hosts!  If I know anyone traveling to Boston,I will recommend that they stay here.,,
Highly,"highly recommended!\"",,,,

13345701,81114567,2016-06-21,78177989,Meghan,Joe greeted us when we got there and showed us around the place. It is more like a hotel or B&B than staying in someones house which was nice if that's what you're looking for. It was very clean and quiet. Nothing super special but worked well for what we needed and in our budget.
"The neighborhood was walking distance to local bars and restaurants! It was also very quick to the airport if you are coming or going through Boston Logan.\"",,,,,

First time staying at an Airbnb so I have nothing else to compare it to, however everything was what the pictures and description made it out to be. Great stay all together."

We would have liked a coffee maker in the kitchen or a small one in the room. But there is a Duncan donuts a short walk away. Also a mirror in the room would be nice, so make up etc can be done there to free up the bathroom sooner for other guests."

Nice kitchen and two bathrooms. Neighbourhood seems safe. The pictures capture the room very well.  There is a Duncan Donuts around the corner.
Joe is a great host. He usually replied to my questions in less than a minute. He even picked me up from the Airport at 11pm. I totally understand why he is almost always booked,"he truly deserves the 5 stars. \"",,,,

We loved that she had water bottles out for us, and extra toiletries in a basket in case you forgot anything. The cat and dog were adorable and super friendly.

Marcia's home was located in a very nice neighborhood, about 10 minutes away from the conservatory and about 5 minutes away from the Massachusetts Ave Silver Line stop. Marcia and her family were very kind and hospitable. I appreciated that she provided a Keurig, protein bars, toiletries, and towels in the room. I also made use of the wifi in their home. I felt very comfortable there, probably more so than at a hotel. I'll definitely be staying here again when I return to Boston!"

Provided water, maps, toothpaste and other amenities I was not expecting.   The location seems safe and very near NorthEastern University, which was my goal.  Overall positive experience."
9362821,61710759,2016-02-07,56744221,Greg,"There are a lot of things I really enjoyed about this listing - the bedroom was clean, warm, and cozy, there were tons of amenities in case you forgot to bring any toiletries. There was coffee and a Keurig in the room and the bathroom was clean and private. The location was convenient and the neighborhood seemed safe. Although the physical space was great, I hesitated to give this listing a higher rating because I was greeted at the door by a minor (I believe the host's son) who appeared to be the only one at the home, and I wasn't given any advance notice that the host (or another adult) wouldn't be present. Although her son was very polite, the situation made me uncomfortable. Had the host or another adult been present, and had the host communicated with me who to expect to be at the house when I arrived, I would have given this listing 5 stars."

She set the tone for a lovely trip even before we arrived by being quick to respond to messages and being very flexible on our arrival time (we had a late flight and didn't get in until after midnight, but it wasn't a problem for her at all). Her home is warm and inviting and the room was more than we could have hoped for! There were bottles of water, granola bars, a selection of personal care products in case we forgot anything- even a first aid kit! My favorite was the coffee machine and selection of coffees and teas, plus to-go cups and lids so I could take my coffee with me when we left for the day. We were given a key to the room along with one for the house, so we could lock up our room while we were gone. And Marcia's son was just as great a host as Marcia and even offered to get more coffee for us when my favorite kind ran out. Having such a comfortable, beautiful room to come back to made our trip to Boston that much more wonderful and relaxing.  And her lovely pets- Dolce (the dog) and Gabbana (the cat) were so sweet! We can't wait to come back and visit again! Thank you Marcia for opening up your home to us!!"

The room was very comfortable and inviting. We had everything we could possibly need and more. The bed was more comfortable than my own.,,,,,
The location is ideal. Its part of a great neighborhood for sites and close to the subway for further travel.,,,,,
"Thanks again Marcia!\"",,,,,

Her room is equipped with all the comforts of home: water, coffee maker, snacks, wine, toiletries, hair dryer, tv with Netflix, and a comfortable bed. The private bathroom was great, as I was in town for work and was concerned about sharing a bathroom with the family or other guests in the morning. The location of her home is very close to the T station (5-6 blocks) and bus stops, which made it very easy to get around town."
My main complaint about the listing was the neighborhood. I did not feel very safe walking down the street that Marcia's family lives on,and as a result,I ended up paying extra money to take an Uber to and from her house anytime I was carrying my laptop or returning after dark. One of my Uber drivers confirmed my concerns about the neighborhood and suggested that I not walk outside alone after 9pm. Overall I had a good stay and nothing bad happened to me,"but I would not feel comfortable staying here again as a young woman traveling alone.\"",,

Location is good as well - Whole Foods Market is in the next building,easy transportation around the city. 15-30 minutes walk to any place in Downtown.,,,,
The only downside is a street noise - you probably won't open the windows at night,but otherwise it's not too bad.,,,,

7921131,51465893,2015-10-20,36996,Jennifer,The condo was very clean.  The furnishings and appliances were modern and like-new.  Wi-fi and cable TV were a nice benefit and aided in our enjoyment.
"Check-in was easy and the Flatbook Team was welcoming and responsive.  The location was convenient for subway access (less than 10 min walk).  Light sleepers may benefit from earplugs due to the nearby rail and road traffic.  Would definitely stay here again.\"",,,,,
7921131,51809316,2015-10-24,20786016,Ryan,"This apartment was excellent and had everything I needed for a great stay in Boston.   The Flatbook team is extremely helpful and checked on me throughout my stay via e-mail to ensure I had everything I needed.  The  apartment felt new (and almost unused!), and there's a Whole Foods and coffee shop right at the bottom of building, which kept me fed and full of caffeine."
7921131,52117796,2015-10-26,5007760,Hanah,"Flatbook was extremely professional, prompt, and accommodating.  They were very proactive with emailing us details about our stay, and checking in on us.  Highly recommend them, and the apartment we got had a marvelous view!"
7921131,54518515,2015-11-21,2007084,Mike,The Flatbook team and apt is awesome. Perfect for what I needed. Close to everything and a nice quiet neighborhood.  I'm probably going to stay here everytime I come to Boston for long work trips. Place was awesome.
7921131,55395955,2015-12-01,29758340,Shucheng,"It was truly a pleasure to stay with Flatbook. I spent a week at the Ink Block apartment in South End Boston. Like other reviewers have mentioned previously, the apartment was very spacious and clean, almost like new. All the cooking and bathing essentials from olive oil to shampoo are provided, towels neatly folded, everything looks nice. Nice neighborhood, lots of great restaurants close by and a wholefood right downstairs. The building is very stylish and safe, only residents with key card can operate the elevator. Flatbook representatives were very proactive regarding my stay, and sent me emails during my stay to check if everything's alright. Overall, it was a perfect stay, definitely would stay again."
7921131,63370307,2016-02-22,45859853,Natalia,Excelente apartamento y edificio. Muy nuevo y todo en perfecto estado. No dudaría en volver! Muy cordiales tanto el anfitrión como el concierge. El whole foods al lado hizo que la nieve y el frío fueran mas fáciles de llevar. Excelente barrio y muy cerca del downtown. Todo como si estuviera nuevo. El gym y las zonas sociales maravillosas. Seria genial poder volver en verano para usar la piscina. Gracias!
7921131,67642515,2016-03-30,40509252,Lauren,"We had a great stay in Boston! The apartment was exactly as described. We were permitted to check in early and someone who works with Flatbook was there to let us into the apartment. Flatbook responded to email questions in under 10 minutes! The apartment itself was very  nice, fully furnished with kitchen cookware, and the building had a nice gym. The apartment was also in a great location. It was walking distance to all sightseeing locations, but was not in the middle of downtown, which was great because we were away from the crowds. I would defintely recommend this apartment and using Flatbook. It was a great stay with great service!"
7921131,69489642,2016-04-11,62842549,Eli,The place is spotless and the building is great. Good fitness center and amenities.   It is a home away from home.  We would stay there again.  The area is really convenient.  The only very small issue is the train is in back and there is some noise.
7921131,70190831,2016-04-16,2721738,Elena,"We booked a different place through Flatbook way in advance, but after we paid for it and about two weeks before our trip the host canceled and offered us this place.  It was too short a notice for us to find something else, therefore we agreed."
The place is in a new apartment building near China town.  It's clean,safe and well stacked. Great view of downtown Boston which is within 20 minutes walk.,,,,
Having Whole Foods right in the building is great.  Wi-Fi signal is strong.,,,,,
However,there is one major flaw in this place.  It's right above two busy highways and a railroad,so the street noise is substantial.  We had a couple sleepless nights before we got used to it.,,,
If you are not used to street noise,be prepared for some discomfort.,,,,

7921131,72519492,2016-05-03,58861374,Mirella,"My experience with the flatbookteam at the inkblock building was excellent. The team was very friendly and made all instructions easy and clear. The appartement was great. All we expected. Clean, spacious and shampoo, coffee etc. available."
Cute to know that 'inkblock' (name of the building) comes from the fact that the Boston newspapers were ones situated at that spot :-),,,,,
"We loved it and would recommend the place and the friendly team. Best regards mirella. \"",,,,,

"Apartment looks exactly like the pictures. It's a \"\"show room.\"\" Clean",neat. View of pool area was nice out of this unit as well as access to the pool,gym and grilling/lawn area. WiFi was super fast as was TV service. Flatbook team was super nice and accommodating. Whole Foods in the building as well as the Capital One Cafe were great and convenient. If you're there on a Sunday,all the craft,antique,farmer/food truck markets are literally down the block. Fun way to spend a day. Area felt safe/doorman at building
Cons,,,,,
It's on the South-South-End of the South-End. This is going to be a bustling neighborhood once the transformation is complete. Right now,it's a great apartment complex in the middle of a lot of revitalization. The Ink Block backs up to a highway and a lot of construction. Yes,you can walk to Tremont or China Town,but it's not out the front door.,,
While stylish,the furniture was far from comfortable. I ended up calling Flatbook after an evening of unrest,which ultimately led to piling the comforter (and extra one in the closet) on the floor as I found it more comfortable than the bed (spring mattress/Ikea low-end quality at best) or couch. The screaming infant next door (not a Flatbook issue) didn't help.,,,
They were amazing related to customer service,but their solutions were limited. Ultimately,they had another apartment in the same building they could move me to. Unfortunately,it wasn't as well-appointed as the first (lost the great view along with the modern furnishings),and was facing the highway. The good news is the couch was definitely a better choice than the bed in the original apartment.,
I felt I overpaid for something that was just okay. I would not stay in the Ink Block again,and not sure on Flatbook given I was told all apartments are furnished with the same bedding.,,,,
I recognize I am the only person who has had issues with the bed (based on reviews as well as my call with Flatbook). So,take that with a grain of salt. I may just have a super sensitive back!,,,,
"\"",,,,,
7921131,79247576,2016-06-12,31231936,Xiyu,The apartment is extremely convenient. It literally had everything I want in the kitchen. Only 10 mins walk to China town and 2 mins walk to a Whole Foods. I will definitely choose to stay here next time.
7921131,89226720,2016-07-27,23357353,Serena,Lovely space! Really enjoyed our time here.
7921131,89615813,2016-07-29,29868904,Reid,The apartment was a great home away from home while traveling for work. The pool was a perfect way to relax after a long day on client site.
13515084,81591695,2016-06-24,62006567,Kimberly,"The house is very clean and neat and the room is exactly as shown in the picture. The host really prepared well for us and is very responsive and helpful when it comes to questions. The area is fairly quiet and within walking distance from restaurants (asian, western, fast food etc), convenience stores and pharmacies. This is our first ever Airbnb experience and I am very impressed with how Joe handled the place. Definitely recommending this host."
13515084,82455721,2016-06-27,26870454,Ariel,Joe was very helpful with our trip to Boston and very accommodating with our arrival time. The place was freshly renovated and clean and comfortable. We had a very pleasant stay.
13515084,82617398,2016-06-28,16639159,Bryan,"Centric, Comfortable and very nice and Modern. kitchen, Water, Shower and everything was just perfect."

13515084,84405161,2016-07-07,23266107,Heidi,"The room was exactly as pictured. Easy to park and walk to public transport. Nice, affordable stay in Boston area. Everything was perfectly clean."
13515084,84692388,2016-07-08,2445235,Cait,"There was a lot to like about Joe's place, but I do have to say upfront that this house is let out by the room. You will have a bunch of visitors to share the kitchen and bathroom with and if you are unlucky like I was, some may lock themselves out and bang on your window all night to get back in. There wasn't really a host here, so no one is in charge to handle problems. We had a pretty negative time of it, but that's not really Joe's fault. The room itself was nice, the bathroom was clean and there were generous choices of toiletries for us all to use. We never met Joe, which would have been fine except the other guests in the house seemed to think we were in charge and expected us to let them in. If you're used to a college dorm of hostels, this place will work for you. (The area, Allston, is awesome.) But if you value AirBnB's community feel and host interactions, maybe find another place."
13515084,85817520,2016-07-13,35218310,Tijana,I had a very pleasant stay in Joe's apartment. The place is very clean and very well organised. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. Will highly recommended to everyone. And I would definitely stay there again if I go back to Boston.
13515084,86287253,2016-07-15,44357424,Irina,"Great location,very close to Cambridge,Harvard,Boston university is just 15 min driving by car."
Nice,clean house and comfy room.,,,,
What a pity,all Joe's rooms are fully booked,"wanted to stay more(\"",,,
13515084,86984092,2016-07-18,63978419,Uthman,"It was a great time,  Joe was very accommodating. Most of all his place was very clean and we'll kept.  It was a great stay. Thx Joe"
13515084,87457554,2016-07-20,52312434,John,The location is nice and the space is clean.  It's fairly easy to get around Boston with public transportation from the house.  The parking spot next to the house was a bonus.  We had privacy and enjoyed our stay.  We would stay there again.
13515084,89033582,2016-07-26,22825392,Kritika,The listing was just as advertised. It was a convenient location for a one night stopover. Centrally located and has private parking. Close to the Harvard campus and therefore close to restaurants and cafes. Joe was very prompt with communication. It was a value oriented listing- great for students or travelers on a budget.
13515084,90490959,2016-08-01,4706514,Martha,"The listing was accurate and Joe was very responsive. We loved the convenience of the house, the great neighborhood, and how spotless everything was."
13515084,91164208,2016-08-04,2775898,Jay,"Everything worked out for me, though there's nothing special to mention. Felt a bit like I was staying at a hostel, rather than an B&B."

13515084,92045832,2016-08-07,62619683,Swapnil,It was a super awesome place to stay. Very well maintained and close to everything. Will definitely stay here again
13515084,92883342,2016-08-10,40442115,Sara,"I needed to learn to use the washing machine by quarters. It took me a bit while to learn it, I asked the host's Mother if I need to get my luggage out of the room. she was kind and said not necessary, so I ended up check out a little late than usual. Everything else was fine."
13515084,93958369,2016-08-14,11404884,Bonny,"The listing was exactly as described, there was even a water cooler that provided fresh filtered water and shampoo/soap/conditioner available for the guests to use which was above and beyond."
13515084,94508525,2016-08-16,74572565,Jack,"Hosts were friendly. The description was very accurate. The neighborhood was alright, but a little shady at night."
13515084,95636222,2016-08-20,86927154,Emanuel,"Loved this place. Very clean, quiet, very close to where I work. Plenty of parking space. I can only recommend this place."
13515084,97609296,2016-08-28,35528171,Stoyan,The place is really nice and very clean. Close to the Harvard Business School (10 min walk). Rooms are newly painted and furniture is new. Nice kitchen and two bathrooms. Big flat screen TV with cable and fast WLAN. Neighbourhood seems safe. The pictures capture the room very well.  There is a Duncan Donuts around the corner I case you need breakfast ;-)
Joe is a great host. He usually replied to my questions in less than a minute. He even picked me up from the Airport at 11pm. I totally understand why he is almost always booked,"he truly deserves the 5 stars. \"",,,,
13515084,99654494,2016-09-05,93350341,David,"La casa es exactamente como se describe, hasta mejor diría yo. Llegamos muy de noche, pero el propietario se arreglo para dejarnos ingresar a esa hora. El cuarto muy bien cuidado y con todos lo servicios ofrecidos. Muy recomendado y lo volveré a usar en un futuro."
1178106,4780766,2013-05-25,5853115,Diogo,Great location and great staff. Check in and instructions were easy. Strongly recommended.
1178106,4914557,2013-06-01,5752384,Luca,"as advertised, very good host and responsive even at short notice. Easy, and very well organized house. About 5 minutes walking to the subway. Airbed is decent but not really good and flat, and room is very small (only the bed), but good for the price. If it's really hot outside than it's a problem because it's small and doesn't have air conditioning."
1178106,4957254,2013-06-03,3815156,Jerry,Great value for money.. Neat and clean living space.. Very accessible by public transit.. Overall great experience. Thank you
1178106,5074706,2013-06-10,6778614,Lindsey,"This is definitely great for those of you visiting Boston for a short stay from foreign countries. The house was kept clean and nice. The location is a few t stops away from some great attractions, but there isn't much nearby within walking distance. The room itself might be a little cramped for a more long term stay, but in general it was a good experience."
1178106,5477221,2013-07-01,2032369,Charles,"Well located, not to far from the subway station, and with many nearby commerces."
It should just be noted that it is in East-Boston,which is not evident from the title of the listing,but the area seemed safe,with very frequent patrols of police cars.,,
The only drawback - I was on my own. I never met the host once,"but there is a phone number to call his friend.\"",,,,
1178106,6729633,2013-08-23,3210750,Ole,Perfect hosts!

The hosts are very friendly and for sure they will help you with everything you need help or information for. They made our stay very comfortable with their easy way to go and we had so much fun!!,,,,,

1178106,6962430,2013-09-01,7189005,Dirk,"I really enjoyed staying with Islam, it was absolutely fantastic."
He had everything perfectly organised with everything that i needed before i got there,it was clear he's been doing this for a while and is a great host. Islam was extremely welcoming and spent time with me straight away to give me a rundown of the city and some local places to visit.,,,,
The location in east boston is really close to the airport and public transport was very easy to get a handle of. I stayed there for four days and had a great time. I didn't spend a huge amount of time in the house as its such a fun city,but everything that i needed was there and i was really comfortable when i was at Islam's house. He was more than happy to let me use the fridge,and had a washing machine and dryer that came in handy of course - i can't say enough good things about it really.,,,
"Loved it. Thanks Islam\"",,,,,
1178106,7704979,2013-09-30,7514305,David,"I didn't actually meet Islam while staying at the house, but I did meet his helper who showed up and cleaned. The room was small but comfortable, and the facilities just fine. The location is within easy walking distance of the Airport T and there is a grocery store a short walk away. Everyone seemed to be friendly."

1178106,9922639,2014-01-19,4274489,Landon,Nice room. Great location. Accepted me on short notice. Place was easy to find. Perfect if you are going to Logan airport and have a flight in the early morning.
1178106,12483083,2014-05-04,10892106,Hooroo,"Dangerous, shady neighborhood, did not feel safe so we didn't stay, he refused to refund, took every penny. Do not stay with a person with such low character."
1178106,12578594,2014-05-05,14575792,Bm,"Preis-Leistungsverhältnis war wunderbar. Alles sehr sauber, Bett bequem, Küche gut benutzbar. Izzy selbst habe ich nicht kennengelernt. Bei meiner Ankunft waren zufällig andere Gäste da, die mich reingelassen haben. Also am besten im Vorab-Kontakt sicherstellen, dass die Schlüsselübergabe klappt. Der Flughafen ist wirklich nah und die Verbindung ins Zentrum sehr gut."
1178106,13508739,2014-05-29,13689592,Sunwoo,"Izzy's house is in a good location. This is the best thing about staying in his house. On the other hand, there are several things that I want to complain about staying in Izzy's house. I texted Izzy before I leave for Boston and I called him twice when I arrived in Boston, but he didn't answer! I found Izzy's house and finally got into his house after 4pm, there was no one there. There are four rooms and only one was empty. The room was not cleaned up and it made me feel bad. That day, I met Najad in the evening. He said he is Izzy's assistant! And he told me about the room and promised me clean it up next day. Najad was helpful and nice. I understand Izzy hired assistant maybe because he is too busy or something. But I think Izzy should have written about his assistant and leave the assistant's phone number or something in airbnb!"
1178106,14243778,2014-06-15,14400147,Alejandro,"The hosts were VERY good, welcoming, open and easy going. They are always trying to help and to keep your experience good. Izzy is easy to reach and will always (in my experience) respond to whatever you need and is achievable by him. Nahshon is superb also!"
My expectations were covered in terms of the place itself. It has some nice common areas (TV,kitchen and the small patio/solarium). It was a good place to be,clean because everybody (guests and hosts) collaborate to keep it that way.,,,
The only comment I have to say is the neighborhood. It's a latin quarter,so it has a certain feeling. The first day I felt a bit unsafe by walking towards the house at 1 in the morning,but as I spent days (was there for 12 days) I realized that it is actually a safe neighborhood. It tends to be more crowded from early morning until perhaps 11 pm,afterwards,streets are lonelier,but after that first walk I felt way more safe.

1178106,14803047,2014-06-26,16528897,Karsten,Very warm welcome and helpful. The place was shared with more people which I like a lot.

1178106,16217582,2014-07-23,8859767,Matthew,The room was as advertised. I didn't meet Izzy during my stay but his roommate was helpful and friendly.

The kitchen was perfect to store the occasional snack or leftovers in.  The place had a grown up hostel feel to it, with several other guests staying there.  It was rather fun.  Izzy answered all of my questions promptly via text and his brother was also a great host.  I would recommend this place to anyone staying in Boston."

The house is exactly as advertised and is very close to the train to Boston and airport. For the price and location,"you can't beat it. I would stay here again when I am next in Boston. \"",,,,

1178106,20150630,2014-09-24,100512,Sesalee,Nice stay and the room was clean.  Easiest Check in with Keys and Check out system . 4 rooms rented  with 1 + guest > at least on my stay  and only 1 bath room available. I didn't expect to share the only bathroom with so many people. House mates where nice to let you get in before showers. Always seemed rushed and someone was waiting on the bathroom when I got out.  Easy to get to Subway and airport. Would stay again for a short stay.
1178106,20220351,2014-09-25,3149897,Matthew,The place was not hard to find after leaving the Boston airport.   It was clean and tidy inside.   The wifi was fast and bed was comfortable.  My only gripe is that there was only one bathroom and with several guests staying at one time you may have to wait for your chance.

The room is very clean and cozy; just what I needed before getting on a flight back home. He even offered me dinner that he and his friends were cooking (Peruvian) and instead of going out, had a great time hanging and getting to know them. All in all, a great time!"
1178106,21386104,2014-10-16,21212767,Kelly,"Staying at Izzy's was exactly the kind of experience that my boyfriend and I needed while staying in Boston.  As travelers on a budget, we couldn't expect anything more.  The towels and sheets were clean along with the bathroom.  There is only one bathroom, so be prepared to take turns with other guests getting ready in the morning and evenings.  We ate out the majority if not all of our meals which meant that the kitchen area wasn't a big deal for us.  It seemed like it may have been difficult for the host to keep the kitchen spotless with full time renters and so many Air Bnb guests.  You can easily see that Izzy's is an overall good place to stay by the good reviews and frequency of guest staying in the home.  The neighborhood was also a good location as it was just five blocks from the airport T station.  THIS made the stay completely worth it as you can hop on the train and be to downtown or the airport in a breeze. Definitely check out the restaurants that the host recommends as he knows what he is talking about.  Delicious food right in the neighborhood! Overall...perfectly decent spot for travelers on a budget."
1178106,22244456,2014-11-02,866643,Joshua,"I stayed here for two weeks waiting on an apartment to open up. You gets lots of living space in the house, although the room itself barely holds a bed and a suitcase. The other rooms looked quite spacious, albeit more expensive. The facilities were generally clean and tidy, although the dishes piled up quite a bit. Like another reviewer said, it feels like an adult hostel -- there are 4 other rooms that can be rented concurrently with your own. One bathroom for that many folks can get a bit competitive. Overall, I would stay here again, but in a larger room."

시설은 그냥 사진그대로고 나쁘지않습니다 매일 11시이후에 청소부가와서 관리하는것같습이다 지하1층에 세탁기와 건조기를 무료로 이용할수있어서 좋습니다 부엌을 사용가능하지만 실질적으로 음식은 하나도 없어서 먹을것이나 식재료를 사와야합니다,,,,,

Again I came super late (my flight landed just after midnight), Izzy stayed up to make sure I got in, he completely didn't have to do that.  Most importantly though he's just... nice, you know?

1178106,27865586,2015-03-13,24318052,Jeff,Great! Izzy responded quickly to my last minute request and provided exactly what I needed! I needed an inexpensive place to crash between flights at Logan airport. His place gave me a clean room that was basically within walking distance of the airport. Check in and check out was smooth and simple.
1178106,27906699,2015-03-14,29066194,Jack,The neighborhood is sketchy and their was nobody at the home to welcome me. The room was shockingly small and not very clean. The bed was in horrible condition and was topped with a musty comforter. There was a towel with a huge bleach stain on the bed. I opened the window to let some air in the room and after ten minutes decided to leave. I booked another room in a different area and was much happier.

The place was kept clean downstairs but was minimalist and devoid of a cozy home feel. Also, going upstairs to my room it became apparent that this was more like a boarding house with several others staying at the apartment in other rooms. That threw me off a little bit because even if the host was well rated and he screened for guests it still made me feel uneasy to have these strangers in close quarters. The room was small but functional. The bed was terrible and needs to be replaced. Quite lumpy. The neighborhood was nice. There were great pupuserias to eat at nearby and Sacred Heart parish was a short walk away which made going to mass easy. Overall it was good and I would probably stay here again."

Despite the super-low price which led to me there'd be just a bed and nothing else, the place actually had all the little perks -- a bottle of water by the bed, toiletries in the bathroom, tea and coffee in the kitchen, etc. GREAT value for money!"
The host was easy to contact and answered my questions quickly.,,,,,

1178106,29080871,2015-04-03,14001967,Serene,"Izzy is very efficient in his replies and he gives very long and clear instructions so if you follow them, you will have no problem with the check in. It feels like a diy process with other airbnbers in the house. The room is very small and hardly any place to open my luggage. The bedsheets smell good however the towel was dirty with lots of hair! There was also a broken light that needs to be cleared. Communicated with lzzy and he asked me to help myself to a new towel in the basement. The toilet and kitchen is fully equiped, however you are not sure if you can use anything because there are other airbnbers around and not sure if it belongs to them! The location is not as close to the airport as i thought! If you have luggages, you dont want to drag them for ten mins walk from the T station. And with a cab ride, its almost $25 away. The neighbourhood doesnt feel as good too, but still you can find many food places walking around. If you like some privacy or diy process, it can be a good choice."
1178106,29575901,2015-04-09,931327,Swizec,The room was great! Literally a 10 minute WALK from the airport subway station. And it took me less than 20 minutes to get downtown from the front door.
The neighbourhood was great as well,very residential so not somewhere you'd hang out and do stuff,but it's quiet at night and feels pretty safe. There are also two corner stores nearby.,,,

1178106,30172086,2015-04-18,23122561,Roger,"I would not describe this place as cozy. Far from it. There was a weird odour permeating throughout the house that was unbearable. I also thought it was a dirty. In terms of the room itself, the mattress was terrible to sleep on. All the finishings in the house were incredibly cheap. I got the impression during my entire stay that Izzy placed little effort into making guests feel welcome. All in all, not a good experience. I encourage guests to find a better Airbnb host in Boston."
1178106,30566863,2015-04-24,12452479,Sonja,"The place was not what I expected in cleanliness but the room itself was clean. The directions are written in a more complex way than they have to be. It wasn't clear to me, before arrival, that the house has several rooms, fyi. Everyone there seemed nice. I didn't get to meet Izzy, he wasn't around. Place is close to the train. Great if you want/need to be close to the airport."
1178106,31369442,2015-05-04,31487214,Richard Aka Dick,Izzy is a good distant communicator in a time sense - very quick to reply but he made no physical presence over the 3 day period of my stay and my experience was similar to being accommodated in a hostel. The room was smaller that the description given and the facilities - bathroom and toilet in the same room downstairs was shared with 6 other people.  In communicating my unhappiness to Izzy over the size of the 'cosy' room he used the word 'transparent' as his objective in describing his offering. I found this very ironic given the lack of description of the actual situation Izzy operates which is very removed from what I understand 'hosting' to mean. The kitchen and tiny room was clean and tidy and the building itself is in a central location with a shabby facade.
1178106,32035453,2015-05-12,32304618,Omkar,Izzy was a great host. Was there only for a night this time. The room was small but comfortable. Very close to the airport.

Positives: Short walk to train station,clean room,simple/unassisted check-in available,coffee/tea stand available,free street parking,and a very good deal for the Boston area
Negatives: The room was much smaller than the pictures depicted,but we didn't plan on spending a lot of time in the room. We also didn't find any towels available,so be sure to bring them.,,,
"I think it is also important to note that if you aren't familiar with \"\"city\"\" living and an urban atmosphere","you may be *slightly* afraid of the area at first appearance. It is a diverse neighborhood with a good bit of foot traffic during the day with locals \"\"hanging out\"\" in front of their homes",etc. It didn't bother me personally and we didn't have any bad experience,"but I could see how certain people would be a little hesitant; especially when you combine this with the \"\"hostel\"\" feeling and absence of Izzy on the premises.

He is also a fantastic guy to spend some time in conversation with, as he's had a wide range of experiences and is enlivened by new ideas."
The house was pleasantly communal and comfortable,while my room was private and simply yet adequately furnished. It was nice and clean,"and a great place to decompress and rest before an early morning flight.\"",,,
1178106,34912599,2015-06-13,35225137,Pedro,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was an excellent one. Izzy was very friendly and helpful. I arrived after noon and my room was ready to be occupied, which was a great relief after such a long flight from Houston. Izzy recommended excellent places to grab lunch. The neighborhood is a bit colorful, but nothing to be worried about. The room was exactly as described, small but comfortable. The house was in very good shape, clean and tidy. Shared bathroom also spotless. As a plus, it was relatively easy to get to the apartment from the airport, since the shuttle drops you at the T station. Overall a very good experience!"
1178106,35244649,2015-06-16,34298787,Yan,"Initially I booked the room for a 3 days' travel, but something came up I had to reduce the stay to 1 night. 3 days before the arrival date, I asked the owner if the stay period can be changed from 3 nights to 1 night. Airbnb showed there should no problem, but I didn't hear anything from the owner."
Eventually I was charged 3 nights for my 1 night stay. The house rule said cancellation can be made one week before arrival,which is unreasonable,since most hotels have 24 hours full refund cancellation policy. Also I didn't totally cancel the stay,just wanted to adjust the duration of stay. I don't think the owner is sharing the spare space with good faith,because charging someone 3 nights for 1 night stay sounds like a robbery to me. The owner was obsessed with money. If you want to book this place,make sure your plan is never going to change in one week prior
1178106,36040535,2015-06-24,12320244,H,"Izzy was a great host and the room was immaculate, temperature controlled in the room, the bed perfect in terms of comfort. Much to my very great delight the bedding, towels and room had no added perfume or scent. How amazing!!  I could not have had a better experience."

1178106,36815691,2015-07-01,86595,Adèle,"Izzy was quick to respond to my request and sent me detailed information about the airbnb. I did not meet Izzy in person, but there was an assistant available to answer any questions I had. The room was cozy and clean like the rest of the house."
I was on a layover and the location was perfect. Easy access to the city and easy access to the airport. I arrived pretty late in the evening so I would recommend if you're not familiar with the area to take a cab (13$US) if it's dark. During the day,it was a quick jaunt to the airport shuttle.,,,,

1178106,37092520,2015-07-04,31994968,Dan,"I enjoyed my stay in room A! Small, but comfortable.  I didn't have much luggage, so the room was just right."

Although Izzy was not there when I arrived,his directions were very clear,"and my room had a nice welcome sign. \"",,,
1178106,37694665,2015-07-09,24261903,Mateusz,I can sincerely recommend this place. It is easily noticeable that Izzy put much effort and professionalism to make airbnb guests comfortable. Location is very close to Logan airport. The house is quiet and offers all facilities mentioned in the description. You won't be disappointed on any level.
1178106,38794537,2015-07-18,29394956,Chris,The host was not present. It was self check in and the host gave instructions on the Airbnb website.
1178106,38925885,2015-07-19,4982994,Colin,Great place. Exactly as described. Very easy to check-in and very close to the airport. Perfect place for a landing pad in Boston.

1178106,40801443,2015-08-02,30313149,Ryan,Very casual environment at Izzy's place.  It's nice that it's just a walk from the airport and also very easy to get to downtown.
1178106,41182268,2015-08-04,24774959,Ronald,It was as advertised. Some noise from other guests kept me up but overall good experience. Izzy was very friendly.
1178106,41245531,2015-08-05,37913979,Aaron,I only stayed one night. But the place was clean and Izzy was very friendly
1178106,41426123,2015-08-07,25714505,Rachael,"Clean, close to airport, nice hosts. Would stay here again!"
1178106,41810426,2015-08-09,17816681,Sara,"Izzy's place was as described and easy to find. I was a little surprised by the surrounding neighborhood; it didn't feel as safe as I would have liked. However, the actual street and house were fine. The room had a window A/C too!"
1178106,42027435,2015-08-10,3474750,Joanne,This room was ideal for our purpose. We flew into Boston at a very late hour and needed somewhere to sleep until we could take the bus home on the final leg of our vacation (URL HIDDEN) host has easy-to-follow instructions on how to find the place from the airport and how to gain access into the house. I would probably choose somewhere else if I was going to be staying for more than one night.
1178106,42198243,2015-08-11,5181752,Gina,"The room is exactly as described: cozy, clean, comfortable, and close to the airport stop on the T. The section of town is a bit grittier than I was expecting, but I did not feel unsafe. Izzy gave very clear check-in instructions, and everything went smoothly even though he was not there on premises. We REALLY appreciated being able to leave our luggage at the house even after check-out so we didn't have to carry it around town all day. If you're looking for a reliable, professional option close to the T and the airport, this place is highly recommended!"
1178106,42323622,2015-08-12,4107208,Dan,"My stay was great! It was a sparse, but comfortable room: perfect if you just need somewhere to sleep prior to catching a flight. I was allowed to check out late and hang out in the wifi enabled common room, too!"
1178106,42443647,2015-08-13,36813099,Jessica,"I didn't meet Izzy but he was upfront and let me know when attempting to make the booking that the room was small and price reflected conventions in town.  Very clear directions about arrival and very walkable to airport shuttle/public transit. First room at the top of the stairs is noisy when guests arrive late at night (due to creaky stairs/thin walls?) Very nice to allow us to leave our bags after check out, since our flight wasn't until later that evening!"
1178106,42591382,2015-08-14,38301688,杨,That house is very convenient to go to the light rail and airport shuttle bus station. lzzy gave us a password before our arrival. That room is comfortable and clean. We'd like to stay there again in future.
1178106,43572663,2015-08-20,40784213,Neelima,Got all the details I needed from Izzy in a timely fashion. Had no difficulty finding the place and checking in. The listing description is fairly accurate; I appreciated the fact that the place was very clean and guests were required to leave their footwear downstairs in the cabinet so as not to carry dirt all over the place. The neighborhood was very nice and appeared safe. Lots of nice restaurants around. The only issue I had was that my friend who brought me over had a hard time finding parking.
1178106,43838069,2015-08-22,18048420,Maxime,"This place is like a mini youth hostel, with rooms and public spaces, located in the hispanic populated part of Boston (East Boston), about 5 minutes walk to the closest metro. Although we didn't meet Izzy in person, we had good indications on how to get in the place and what to do. The room we were in (Room A) was small, but had air conditioning and had a good bed. Finally, we had a good time at Izzy's, and Angela's Cafe nearby was a good guess for breakfast."
1178106,44315463,2015-08-25,35064082,Caitlin,"The location was perfect! Only a few blocks from the airport T station, which was extremely convenient for arrival and departure. Only a few stops on the T to get into the heart of Boston to do all the tourist activities. Izzy was flexible with our check-in/check-out due to flight times, allowing us to drop our bags off early before check-in and to leave our bags after check-out until our flight left. The fully stocked kitchen with a coffee station guests were free to use was a nice touch. The room was quite small but cozy, and it was perfect for what we were looking for as we only used the Izzy's home as a place to sleep and shower. There was only one bathroom to be shared between several guests staying in the multiple rooms, but we rarely ran into a problem getting in when we needed to.  We had a wonderful time!"
1178106,44677628,2015-08-28,30356463,Wayne,The room and location were as described. There was also an air conditioner which helped on the hot evenings. There was often a queue for the bathroom however it was not too long. There was always hot water when I needed it. I would stay here again.
1178106,44979370,2015-08-30,26418944,Gaelle,"Izzy's place was very convenient and it felt as if he has put a lot of thought into making his guests feel welcome.  I parked my rental car around noon and walked to the T stop (about 1/2 mile away) to explore the city, and didn't return until long after dark, but it was easy to navigate and I always felt safe.   I didn't get a chance to meet him, but he provided clear and thorough instructions and I had no problem finding the house, my room, the wireless password and everything.  Several other people were staying at the house, and everyone was friendly, considerate and welcoming.  There's an amazing and authentic mexican cafe about 2 blocks away that one guest recommended for breakfast -- one of the best meals of my entire trip.  Would definitely stay there again!"
1178106,45470997,2015-09-03,36518136,Marina,"Izzy's place was very convenient and well located, the room was clean and big enough for a comfy bed and a desk. Common areas were great too, I loved the patio the most. Only thing was that, due to the extreamly hot weather, the AC had to stay on all night and unfortunately it's very noisy. . Hadn't the chance to meet Izzy, but was in good company with a few other guests. Overall a nice stay, I suggest the place."
1178106,45578460,2015-09-04,39382323,Sofia,"I had a very short stay at Izzy's place but it worked great. Very close to the airport, and very convenient if you need to check in late and check out early. As it says in the ad, the room is very cozy but if you don't plan on spending much time there, it's great. Plus, it's got a very spacious kitchen and living room if you do plan on spending some time at the home. Also, Izzy was great at responding quite quickly to messages."
1178106,45809412,2015-09-06,38647629,Dan,Izzy is a gracious host and great to talk with.  His place is warm and inviting..excellent location!
1178106,46907243,2015-09-14,3478186,Bjorn,Just as described and conveniently located to the airport. Izzy was friendly and laid-back
1178106,47371025,2015-09-18,40568194,Lisa,"I would definitely stay here again if I have an early departure or late arrival from Logan airport, since the location is super convenient. The neighborhood seems very safe (I arrived late at night) although it is a little tricky to find the apartment at night because the park by the T stop near the apartment closes its gates at night so you have to walk around.  Izzy was very prompt at responding to my many inquiries, as my plans were changing."
The room itself is very small,as described,"but the bed is actually bigger than it looks in the photo (full size instead of single bed).  Which means that you have more room in the bed but less space in the room than you might imagine.\"",,,
1178106,47506087,2015-09-19,1216578,Manuela,"Great location, very close to the airport was a short walk to the bus stop. We only stayed one night but the it was perfect, room was very cozy - would definitely recommend"
1178106,47796688,2015-09-21,7044030,Danielle,"Just as described - cozy room, nothing fancy. Neighborhood has some great restaurants but it's a different atmosphere than downtown Boston."
1178106,48316140,2015-09-25,30359726,Ana,Izzy was there to great us upon arrival at around 6 pm. He was helpful at giving us recommendations for dinner and a great location for a view of the skyline.
The room was as described. A very small room on the second floor of the house. The bed wasn't very comfortable and the room didn't have a pleasant odor. The room could use a mirror since the bathroom is shared by multiple guest and Izzy's family.,,,,,
Our light was out the first night we arrived and past midnight by the time we noticed so we didn't bother contacting Izzy to fix it that night. We did however message the him and he fixed it before our return to the room that second night. It did however take him a reminder and several hours for him to even acknowledge our request to have the light change.,,,,,
"Overall we had a decent stay. The room is perfect if you are on a budget and will only need the room to sleep and store your luggage.  \"",,,,,
1178106,48416751,2015-09-26,42427398,Huimeng,"Izzy made a clear introduction on how to get his house, which is quite closed to the airport. Very good choice for people who have early flights:)"
1178106,48719168,2015-09-28,41145665,Philippe,"Accueil de piètre qualité, Izzy a été présent durant cinq minutes, le temps de délégué son jeune frère pour nous montrer la chambre et nous donner de trop maigres informations. Chambre très petite où le manque d'aération occasionne une odeur désagréable."
Place insuffisante pour le rangement des bagages.,,,,,
Une salle de bain pour,au moins six personnes.,,,,
Nous avons du mal a comprendre  que les avis s'accordent à donner 5 étoiles à cette  maison qui,pour nous a été le pire logement de notre  voyage se composant de sept étapes.,,,,

1178106,48886122,2015-09-29,40390662,Claire,"Izzy was so kind and welcoming. He rents a few rooms and runs the house very professionally, it was spotless and comfortable. He was great to talk to!"

House was as described,"easy to get to and self 'check in' had really clear instructions. \"",,,,
1178106,50323002,2015-10-11,43901643,Michael,"What we liked: the location. Although the neighbourhood is a little bit sketchy and dirty, we didn’t have any negative experience with the locals. As advertised, the room is about 5-6 minutes away from the MBTA station and the Airport shuttle."
What we didn’t like: the room is extremely-extremely small – there is no place for two people to stand in it; one has to sit down. It has a non-standard size,very short,self-made “bed” with a poor quality mattress. The owner mentioned that the house is professionally cleaned,but we saw some traces of bare feet on the floor when we checked in. We also saw some old UPS packaging and rugs on the front porch that looked like being there for a while. Therefore,I would question the professional cleaning statement. The main floor and bathroom are reasonably clean,though.
Bottom line: I would not recommend renting this specific room for two people or taller people (I’m 6’2”). Nevertheless,the other two guest rooms on the second floor are much bigger and have normal beds in them.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1178106,50874685,2015-10-15,2173929,Andrew,Izzy wasnt there but there was a nice young guy called Jake over-seeing things.
The room was small comfy and fine. Bathroom clean with a nice hot shower. Kitchen was good.. Hostel feel with coffee and tea and biscuits that people had left behind available for communal use.,,,,,
Nice mellow safe neighbourhood with useful shops and eateries around.,,,,,
Close to airport.,,,,,
Sure its pricey for a small room but i guess this is the north eastern US and thats the market - with average hotel rooms at 200+ dollars.,,,,,
"I can recommend this place. \"",,,,,
1178106,51303153,2015-10-19,30873414,Allison,The description was definitely accurate with the size of the room.  The room was VERY cozy.  We were not even able to lay down our suitcase and open it up on the floor.  Very tight space.
The other parts of the house were not very clean as advertised.  In the directions,it said to clean up after yourself in the kitchen and bathroom which were both a mess.  When we arrived late Friday night,"the kitchen was full of dirty dishes.\"",,,

1178106,54363800,2015-11-18,933,Jill,"This place was PERFECT for my needs and saved me big time.   It was great that you can walk there from the airport (from where the airport shuttle drops you at the Blue Line)  I was traveling back from Paris after the attacks and my flight from Boston to Denver was canceled due to an expected snow storm.  I was so lucky to find this perfect, close, affordable place!  I would have loved to stay up and chat with the other, friendly guests there, but I was beat.   There are 4 rooms in this listing and one bathroom, but it presented no problems for me.  Nice kitchen and living room.  If you go to a highly recommended Italian restaurant a couple of blocks away, Rino's, I highly recommend splitting a  meal.   They served me about 2 pounds of pasta in a giant bowl."

1178106,56700194,2015-12-16,50992499,Moiz,It's definitely easy to get to from the airport. Pretty accurate description. Room was small but clean. Bed was comfortable. There were fresh towels available. Bathroom was fairly neat and tidy. Overall I think this is a great place to stay at and the host is very easy to get in touch with. The iron in the basement did a fantastic job in preparing my suit for the interview I was in Boston for.
1178106,56745521,2015-12-17,4888959,Evan,"The check in was very simple and well explained, I never met Izzy and it was a short reservation and yet all components worked well and there were no concerns. The house was simple and comfortable. The house is old and the stairs can be very noisy and sounds carry from other guests in other rooms. Not the quietest location. The location is however right next to the airport and very quick metro to the downtown Boston area!"
1178106,57277379,2015-12-23,32288039,Chris,"Great place to crash after a loooong flight delay! Clean, close to the airport, and the price was right."

Especially if you are a light sleeper,you should know that sound travels very easily throughout the house. This room is right in front of the staircase,so I could hear footsteps every time someone went up and down the stairs,"and I could hear voices of the other guests (not sure if they were downstairs or in their rooms).  \"",,

The entrance to the T and the airport shuttles are about 4 or 5 blocks away from the house but I would recommend a taxi or Uber for late night traversing. The air conditioning unit did not work and the house was very hot - which was fine for a cold winter night, but I wish that I had brought a hand-held fan. There were towels folded neatly on my bed and the bathroom amenities were thoughtful. Overall, a satisfying stay!"

Clean rooms, use of kitchen if necessary. The housekeeper is wonderful and helpful. A little noisy as the walls are thin,  but a great deal nonetheless. Izzy replied promptly to all emails."
1178106,64657227,2016-03-06,49460311,Sarah,The description was accurate and it was an easy check-in process. Bed was comfortable and the small closet was a nice feature. Only downside was its location next to the stairs (which are super noisy)- allowed for you to hear all traffic up and down them as well as anything going on downstairs. Overall a comfortable stay.

1178106,65720894,2016-03-16,4129475,Mehmet,Everything was as they were described in the listing and shown in the photos.
1178106,66121243,2016-03-19,2384877,Snow,Rosa (the lady that met us in the house) was very nice and the place if very close to the airport.  You can easily walk from the MBTA.  This is a great place to stay if you have an early flight.  Don't look for fancy services and chocolate on your pillows at night.  But your not paying for chocolate or services either.  Thanks Rosa and Izzy - worked well for me and my boy.
1178106,67040284,2016-03-26,50660835,Sunshine,that room was really stuffy and small.. also I had to share a bathroom with even 4~5 people but it's clean!
1178106,67302967,2016-03-28,12681517,Danielle,This is the second time I stayed at Izzy's Airbnb and it was great! My room was exactly as described.  I interacted with other visitors who were very kind and considerate with shared spaces. Thanks for another great stay Izzy!

1178106,69763909,2016-04-13,6758049,Justin,"This is my 3rd time staying here because it is so comfortable and convenient. Proximity to airport, cleanliness, friendliness of host, bed and room comfort are just some of the reasons I stay at Izzy's."
1178106,69889327,2016-04-14,20514191,Feyaad,"Stayed for one night before leaving on an early flight. The place had all the basic necessities and seems like a place to just stay for one night. Neighborhood isn't lively you have to take the T to get to the more busy parts of Boston. Place was exactly as described. If you just need a place to stay near the airport, I recommend."
1178106,70668652,2016-04-19,49285340,Patti,I loved the location and the people!  Evelina was so warm and welcoming.

I liked seeing my name on the whiteboard. Simple as it was,it made me feel that I was expected and that someone had made arrangements for me.,,,,
The room was,as promised,cozy in size but also very clean and tidy. The bed was perhaps a little too soft,"but my back felt fine in the morning.\"",,
1178106,73850731,2016-05-10,47438842,Reinhard,Check-in and out was very uncomplicated (we arrived before normal check-in and it was no problem to deposit our luggage). The house has four rooms which are Airbnb'd. Kitchen and bathrooms shared as described. Kitchen is well equipped and there is a large fridge. The room itself was kind of small (as described) but perfect for us as we just came there for sleep. There is also a big shared living room. Perfect connection to subway (~10mins to city) and free airport bus.
1178106,74273658,2016-05-14,43087727,Long,The location of the house is perfect. It is very suitable for the people who wants to catch up the early flight. The house is clean and I feel so comfortable in the house. Lzzy is a very nice host and he give the response in time.

1178106,79491162,2016-06-13,47278588,Yating,"The location is great and really close to airport. So if you have to catch up a flight early in the morning and only needs a quick stay, it works. The room is as small as it can be and there are four tiny rooms on the second floor. We could hear others coming up the stairs and talking in their rooms. The bedding is grey instead of the white and red color in the picture so it's really hard to tell whether it's clean."
1178106,80644094,2016-06-19,74800570,Mandy,"The lady who greeted me, not the host, was sweet but the price was very steep for the condition of the property and the neighbourhood."
1178106,80940649,2016-06-20,39978706,Isaac,"The instructions to reach the house were clear, and I was capable to get there fast after I arrived at Boston."

The room was clean and he provided clean towels and linens for the bed, the bed was comfy. I even got to do laundry there which was nice! Nice, local restaurants within walking distance."
1178106,81562765,2016-06-23,71644747,Haiting,We chose it because it is very close to the airport. The house is very clean and private and we had a good time!
1178106,82370717,2016-06-27,20546271,Jasper,"I stayed here during a layover in Boston, so I came in late and left early."

The room was clean,and was quiet. There is a little area by the kitchen where we had our meals,"and it is nice.\"",,,
1178106,83611744,2016-07-03,24579873,Hanh,"The house was very close to the airport, and the instructions how to get were very straightforward.

1178106,84300452,2016-07-06,7270259,Nicole,"Very friendly host (who was not Izzy, but his cousin).  I booked this space at the last minute during a layover and I couldn't have asked for a more convenient location, etc.  10/10 would book again!"
1178106,84858776,2016-07-09,81688077,Maddy,This was our first time using Airbnb and it was a perfect welcome. We arrived early and the man who was cleaning the house went and got our room ready even though it was only 10:30am. He was very friendly and the house was very clean and welcoming. We really enjoyed our stay in Boston and would stay here again next time.
1178106,85647107,2016-07-12,13777673,Jocelyn,The location is close to the airport. The room looks the same as the pictures. Izzy is responsive and nice. It's a convenient place for a layover in Boston.
1178106,86155380,2016-07-15,72383365,Kim,This is a self-check-in home with about five bedrooms. The other Airbnb guests were so friendly and welcoming yet understood privacy of each guest. The place is immaculate. And the neighborhood is a lovely working-class place. Wifi is good. Great (great!) Mexican restaurant just around the corner plus a corner grocery-store for snacks and necessities.

1178106,87311938,2016-07-19,8755661,Stephanie,"The room was clean and comfortable. The house was full but noise was not an issue. The apartment is extremely close to the airport, which is very convenient. Those with early departures should note, however, that Bremen Street Park is gated and locked before daylight--making the walk to the Airport T station much longer. (I gave up and called an Uber)."

Cara was enorm gastvrij, toen we aankwamen stond er wijn koud, lag er een briefje en lag er allemaal informatie over Boston die we mochten gebruiken. Het huis zelf is prachtig (we hadden een slaapkamer en een badkamer voor ons zelf) en de buurt is de mooiste van Boston, op loopafstand van het stadspark en het centrum. Er zijn gezellige restaurantjes in Charles street, op steenworpafstand. Kortom, een aanrader!"

The apartment is ideally located in a beautiful part of the city ideal for walking and transport and history. Its a short walk to Boston Common. We walked the black rights walk and freedom trail right from our door. We used the nearby train to visiting the JFK museum. We also saw the Boston Tea Party and Ships area, the harbour area and enjoyed eating out in Beacon Hill. Cara provided maps and information and we were afforded plenty of privacy but also some lovely interactions with Cara and Eliot during our stay. We would definitely stay there again."

The apartment was awesome and the private room was cozy and clean. The neighborhood was also fantastic and just a short walk to Boston Common.

6793945,37395184,2015-07-06,36751297,Aditya Reddy,Location: The location is a nice neighborhood in back bay. Walking distance from good restaurants and Walgreens. Not too many bars though. Most of the city is accessible with a $5 Uber ride. Be a little cautious as the area gets a little seedy a few block away.
Apartment: The apartment is amazing. Well done décor and interiors. Newly remodeled kitchen has everything you need and is super fancy. Nothing seemed broken except a clogged sink in the bathroom,but it didn't bother us too much. There is small patio out back looking over the back yard. Lots of trees and greenery to enjoy. Overall a very upscale luxury apartment.,,,,
Host: The host,Yoshika,was very nice and prompt to respond to any questions or concerns we had. The process was super streamlined,airport-cab-apartment. Would definitely recommend to others.,,

With this being our first time, we had lots of questions.  We also didn't confirm our reservation until the week of our trip.  That didn't stop Yoshika from responding almost immediately to any/all of our questions.  Yoshika's kind words really put my wife and I at ease for this mini-vacation.  The apartment was exactly as advertised on the site and the neighborhood was awesome.  We walked to breakfast each morning and used Uber for most of our daily transportation.  Wherever we went the most costly Uber ride was only $11.00!  This apartment is in the perfect location!  The apartment was clean and just the perfect size for a long weekend.  If we ever go back to Boston, we will be sure to get in touch with Yoshika and hope that her apartment is available.  Thanks again Yoshika.  Both you and your apartment were great!"

Yoshika was also wonderful at recommending local restaurant options.  We mentioned our son had food allergies and Yoshika made sure a food processor, blender and extra pots were available in the apartment."
2) Location: South End reminds me of Lower East Side in NYC.  It is a diverse community and artsy.  It is close to Back Bay (Shops at Prudential Center and Copley Mall are about 15-20min walk away).  If using Uber,it is only 5min away.  We did not use public transport.  We either walked,Uber'ed,or used a Zip car to get around.,,
3) Apartment: Apartment was clean and it is an open kitchen/living/dining room.  The king size bed is amazingly comfortable (a nice,"firm bed) and we slept very well.  Kitchen is stocked with everything needed to cook (we cooked quite a bit while there).  There is also a washer/dryer for laundry which we found very convenient.\"",,,,

I travel to Boston regularly for business and my normal hotel was booked - as were most of the hotels in the area. Yoshikas’ apartment was an excellent alternative, and far more comfortable than a hotel."
Although I only stayed 3 nights,but would have been comfortable for a much longer stay. The apartments amenities were ver good,and made for a relaxing and enjoyable trip.,,,
"Thanks again Yoshika!\"",,,,,
6793945,41907874,2015-08-09,2819195,Sarah,"This place was amazing! My husband, 2 yr old son and I stayed here after having to switch from a different airbnb place because of cleanliness. Yoshika's place is incredibly clean, tastefully furnished, stocked with everything you would need, and in a great location! I liked it so much that I told my husband I would live in this apartment!! I really can't recommend this place enough. Also, Yoshika was nice enough to recommend some local places that were kid friendly. Really can't say enough great things!"
6793945,42495843,2015-08-13,41093256,Mike,Yoshika was a fantastic host and the apartment was perfect for us. She was extremely responsive and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood close to all that Boston has to offer.
6793945,43864602,2015-08-22,41194516,Shree,"The apartment was well-kept and hospitable. This seemed like one of the few cases where the apartment looked better in person than in the photos. The bed was also very comfortable, to boot. The neighborhood was central to lots of other exciting Boston areas. I would definitely stay here again."

6793945,68644032,2016-04-06,53634852,Dana,"Yoshika was a great host, very responsive and professional. The property itself exceeded expectations based off of the images and description, and was situated in a great part of the South End. There are a number of great cafes and eateries in walking distance, and you're a short Uber ride from almost everything the city has to offer."
6793945,69360834,2016-04-11,9377168,Cindy,We had a wonderful time! The home is beautifully furnished and comfortable!! The location is very convenient! Our host was very attentive and responsive. I'd highly recommend this home!
6793945,70697919,2016-04-19,16328844,Miguel,"Yoshika our host was very efficient and clear in the way she communicated, provided very good details for our arrival. The place is wonderful, very clean and confortable, excellent location to get around town, the neighborhood is very good and not noisy. The bed was great and the kitchen is perfect, we did not cook, but its an excellent setup for a professional cook. I will highly recommend it. I will definitely stay here again. Also I must say Yoshika went beyond as I forgot an item and she mailed it to me, THANK YOU!"

6793945,74436707,2016-05-15,13812895,Demi Marie,Came on a reunion trip with 3 of my girlfriends. Location was convenient to restaurants and some bars. We were able to take short Uber rides to central attractions in Boston. The bedroom and sofa couch were very comfortable. We had a lot of space to move around. We do wish there was another mirror in the bedroom so we wouldn't have had to crowd ourselves into the bathroom. Other than that we had a wonderful 2 night stay.
6793945,80426116,2016-06-18,2457730,Kelly,"This apartment was exactly as listed: convenient, comfortable and clean. I usually stay at the Park Plaza when I come to Boston for business - but now will try to always stay at Yoshika's. - Steve"
6793945,80926860,2016-06-20,6229282,Sandra,Great location. Lovely apartment. Very comfortable bed. Will definitely choose to stay there again when situation arises.  Easy check in and check out.
6793945,81310338,2016-06-22,1911807,Chris,"My stay at Yoshika's lovely apartment was 5 star. Communications were perfect and the apartment was exactly what I needed for a quick two-night stay in Boston. The apartment is as pictured, spotlessly clean, perfectly laid out and wonderfully quiet. The king-size bed was super comfortable and the kitchen had everything I needed. The neighborhood is a close to a Walgreen's and the lovely Flour Bakery and a nice 10-minute walk to all of the South End attractions. The Silver Line bus into downtown is right on her doorstep. The bathroom, while only big enough for one person at a time, was clean and well-equipped with towels and a hair dryer. Overall, a great place."
6793945,84160619,2016-07-05,22551957,Jose Alberto,"We loved this apartment and felt like locals in Boston where we went for July 4 th weekend to help our daughter settle in to her college dorm, therefore we needed a nearby place to stay in order to come and go to the university moving process."
The apartment is conveniently located in a quiet and yet busy street where we could easily move around downtown Boston.  We noticed a totally renovated place and yet located in a traditional brownstone building.,,,,,
The modern remake of the place makes it highly attractive with an open concept kitchen,high end appliances,wood floors,spacious areas,with good lighting.  We loved the kitchen!  Everything was clean and organized.  The owners provided almost everything one needs to feel like at home:  information booklets,kitchen soap
6793945,86205944,2016-07-15,1314268,Kimber,"Yoshika's apartment is exactly as pictured. It's beautiful and spacious with air conditioning and high ceilings. Her furnishings are lovely and comfortable. I actually wished I could have stayed longer and taken advantage of her beautiful kitchen. It's really something! The big bed is most comfortable, I slept like a baby which is really saying a lot since I normally don't sleep well in a new environment."
The neighborhood is a richly diverse,thriving community and I really enjoyed it. I found an excellent salon just across the street that welcomed me in and fixed my greying tired hair,"too! That was a treat to say the least! Transportation was a snap with the bus and trains throughout the city. I quickly acclimated to the system. I'd definitely recommend this apartment. \"",,,
6793945,87659881,2016-07-21,13147466,Monica,"We stayed two night, the apartment was clean and comfortable, next the bus station, in an very quiet street, wi-fi perfectly working. The price is little bit high.....but Boston it self has high prices."
6793945,88955933,2016-07-26,61652369,Peter,"Our experience at Yoshika's apartment was fabulous.  It is located in Boston's South End -- an area full of hot, trendy new restaurants.  The apartment is extremely clean, very comfortable, and very well equipped.  The kitchen has very high grade appliances and equipped with very nice utensils, dishes, and tasteful details.  The bedroom is spacious with a very comfortable bed, and an extra office room -- ideal if you need to work.  Note also -- the apartment is on the parlor level, so has extra high ceilings and is more spacious than upper floors."
Yoshika's check-in procedure is easy to follow and she communicates very well.  There is a Silver Line station right outside the door,as well as bus stops very near by.  So it's easy to get around.  We stayed during an extreme heat wave.  Fortunately,"the air conditioning works very well.  Everything went perfectly as planned.\"",,,
6793945,90798630,2016-08-02,29836340,Sean,"I stayed at Yoshika's place for a few days with my family before moving into my apt in the South End. As far as location goes, her listing is top notch. I've been using Airbnb for a couple years and I've noticed that pictures for listings usually aim to make them seem bigger than they usually are. Luckily, this is not the case here and her apt seems much larger than the pictures show and is very luxurious. One of my favorite listings!"
6793945,95774570,2016-08-20,88043253,Malik,Yoshika is a first class host!
6793945,98643783,2016-09-01,55910289,Kathleen,"This was one of the best AirBnB experiences I have had.  I was settling my son to start his first year at NEU, it was the perfect location.  The restaurants and local eateries were excellent and representative of the Boston lifestyle.  Yoshika had a thorough guide of the area printed out for her guests and there were no questions or concerns with our stay in her home.  I will stay here again.  Thank you!"

13555596,95096697,2016-08-18,82203952,Mike,This place is your typical boston style apartment. nice and quaint. Very safe neighborhood and using Lyft Line only cost an average of $4-9 to go to anywhere in the city.
Richard was very good at communicating and making recommendations on restaurants and bars. Although I never had the chance to meet him,we did keep in touch the whole trip via text.,,,,
Place was really nice with modern updates and furnishings,nice comfortable california king bed.,,,,
Recommend this place to anyone looking to explore the city,singles,couples,"or business travelers. Convenient to alot of fun stuff.\"",,
4000384,18868703,2014-09-01,10556232,Mikhail,Great place and great host.
The place itself was adorable. Nice cozy room on a top floor of beautiful house with lots of sunshine in the morning was a pleasant place to wake up. And the bath is worth mentioning - gorgeous and huge almost the size of the room itself. Effectively we had all the top floor for ourselves for the price of the room.,,,,,
Particular thanks to the host. I was setting up the trip to Boston at the last minute and was running late for the check in but prompt response from the host and flexibility with check in made the stay smooth and pleasant.,,,,,
And the last but not the least their dog is just awesome.,,,,,
"Overall a perfect place to stay for a couple visiting Boston.\"",,,,,
4000384,19172115,2014-09-07,20795897,Kim,"Evelyn was a very welcoming host.  The moment I arrived she helped me with my luggage, showed me my amazing room with lots of storage and privacy and then walked with me down to the Subway, only 8-10min walk, so that I would be comfortable walking there first thing in the morning.  The bathroom is large, clean and very bright with all the natural light.  I will definitely go back the next time I am in Boston."
"I you have trouble with steps you may want to consider another option this room is on the third floor so you do climb stairs:) It was totally worth it to have the space and privacy:)\"",,,,,
4000384,19389599,2014-09-11,51538,Jeremy,"Evelyn was one of the most welcoming and considerate hosts that I've had the pleasure of meeting through AirBnB.  She has a terrific home, a great private guest suite (at the top of the house) and goes out of her way to make guests feel welcome.  I would highly recommend her, and her home, to anyone considering a stay in Boston!"
And,to those that are leery of traveling outside of the downtown section,"this is a wonderfully safe community with lots of great authentic restaurants in close walking distance.\"",,,
4000384,19498054,2014-09-13,9464344,Daniel,"Evelyn is very friendly and accommodating. She has great local knowledge and can offer directions and neighborhood recommendations.

4000384,19901198,2014-09-20,18382193,Mark,"Evelyn proved to be an excellent host, and greeted me with a chat and a glass of wine. The room was clean and cheerful, and the bed most comfortable. She has a small dog, which was very friendly. The house is about 5 minutes walk from Stoney Brook T station. The fare to Central Boston is$ 2.75, and a weekly ticket at $19 is a bargain for longer stays. Get it on your first journey."
4000384,19967082,2014-09-21,18483182,Sebastian,Even if we came a little bit late (traffic jam) Evelyn was a friendly host and even recommended us some places for having a late dinner. The rooms are quite large. We had a whole floor on our own. There was a comfortable bathroom as well. The neighborhood was very quiet even if it was near the inner city.
4000384,20065773,2014-09-22,2418407,Emily,"We had a nice stay in Evelyn's home. We were only there for one night and had to leave early in the morning, so we didn't get to check out the neighborhood much, but Evelyn was welcoming, helped us find a restaurant for dinner, and even loaned us her umbrella to keep us dry on the way. The room was nice, the bed was comfortable, the space was private, and there was nearby street parking, which is pretty much all we could ask for. And Evelyn's dog is super sweet. =)"
4000384,20592309,2014-10-01,21853797,Bob,"Evelyn was welcoming and accommodated my late arrival.  The room is at the top of the house with a door that closes at the bottom of the stairway, so you feel that you are in your own apartment.  The room is large and the private bath is enormous.  The bed is comfortable and fresh towels are provided."
It is situated 5 minutes from public transportation and the neighborhood is calm.  Highly recommended.,,,,,
"One caveat: the door frames are 6' 3\"\" high and the roof in the bedroom is sloped.  I'm 6' 4\"\" so I just needed to remember to duck when moving between the room and bathroom.\"",,,,,
4000384,20779014,2014-10-05,14551006,John,"Evelyn was an amazing host and the accommodations were exactly what I needed. Even as I was delayed getting in Friday evening for the weekend, Evelyn was gracious and made me feel right at home. The room was spacious and comfortable, the bathroom large and modern, and extra blankets and towels were out for my use. The house is charming and proximal to the Stony Brook T Stop. All in all a great experience - I'd recommend this to anyone. Thanks again Evelyn!"
4000384,21215327,2014-10-13,10466968,Keith,"Evelyn was very nice. She allowed us to check in early, once we arrived in Boston.  We had the entire third floor, and she actually spent the weekend with family, so we only saw her for a short time. Even though it was raining, she offered to walk us to the subway station. And her dog is great - he has a nice, calm disposition."
The home is lovely,the room is comfortable,and the neighborhood is nice. We parked on the street and felt very safe.,,,
This was our first stay at a B and B,and based on this stay,"we would do it again.\"",,,
4000384,21639361,2014-10-20,22400305,Gabi & Franz,We had a great time at Evelyns house. Everything is very clean and cosy. There is a privat bathroom right next to the sleepingroom. As both rooms are on the second floor and seperated from the rest of the house lots of privacy is guaranteed. The furniture is very nice and the bed is very comfortable. Everything looks like on the photos.
It takes about 10 minutes to get to the T and then about 15 minutes to the City center.,,,,,
Thank you very much Evelyn! We had a great time in Boston!,,,,,

Once I arrived, she was very friendly, accomodating, and helpful. She seems to know Boston very well, and is also the definition of a polite host, can't go wrong here."
Her house is beautiful and clean. The bedroom is spacious and comfortable. Not to mention,the bathroom is large and luxurious. To top it off,"this may have been the most comfy bed I've slept in.\"",,,
4000384,22045526,2014-10-28,22402001,Danielle,"My husband and I booked a last minute trip to Boston, and were so happy to find Evelyn's place. Evelyn was very kind and inviting, and although we only saw her a few times (we were gone most of each day) she checked in with us, making sure we had everything we needed. It was conveniently located less than 3 blocks away from the Orange Line and was a 20 min. ride into Downtown. We used the T in the morning, and took a Taxi home each night (apparently Roxbury is not the safest area at night..? That's what we were told--but NEVER felt like this was proven to us...)"
Her house is gorgeous and well taken care of. The room and bathroom are on the 3rd floor of her house and feels very private. The room and bathroom are exactly like the pictures and very spacious with plenty of storage and space. It was perfect for us,"and we would happily stay there again. \"",,,,
4000384,22253408,2014-11-02,22218763,Jami,Evelyn was a wonderful host. When I arrived she personally walked me to the T station and gave me excellent directions to where my conference was located. Her home is beautiful and the guest space is on the third floor and very private. I would make a special trip to Boston just to sleep in that bed again! It was very comfortable. Easy and quick commute into Boston.

4000384,22803261,2014-11-15,51538,Jeremy,"As a repeat visitor to Evelyn's well-priced room, I can wholeheartedly recommend this listing to anyone considering a stay in Boston.  Even though it's not in the heart of downtown, it's only a quick subway ride to the heart of Boston."
4000384,23100376,2014-11-23,12903528,Geoff,This setup was great!  My wife and I really enjoyed it.  It was exactly as advertised.  The room/bathroom were clean and large.

4000384,28682523,2015-03-28,13618231,Jack,"Evelyn is a great host. Unfortunately, we only had a chance to speak briefly.  Her place was exactly as listed. Loved how much privacy the room offered, as it was the entire 3rd floor.

Evelyn was helpful in every way when we needed guiding but also very relaxed with us coming and going early mornings and late evenings.,,,,,
"She has a wonderful dog that greets you every time you enter the house. So you always came \"\"home\"\" with a good feeling.",,,,,
Also there is a nice yard/garden that we didn't had a chance to explore. But next time!,,,,,
Yes,and there was always a nice breakfast prepared in the mornings. We were jet lagged and were up really early so that was a great saver at some points.,,,,
It takes 5 minutes walking to get to the subway which is great. Orange Line. Only downside is that there isn't a lot of café,restaurants or stores in the neighborhood so if you're looking for that they are a 15 minutes walk away at centre street/south street.,,,,
On the other hand the quit,"beautiful neighborhood gives you a chance to reload your batteries which we enjoyed for example by doing our own spa in Evelyn's wonderful bathroom :) \"",,,,

She made every effort to make our stay in the city enjoyable, and provided useful information about getting around, as well as a tasty bite to eat to get us on our way in the mornings. The neighbourhood was safe and, while not in the centre of the city, was very accessible to the transit system (2 blocks away) that would get you there in 10-15mins.

We left our car here for the weekend, and took the subway (only a 5 minute walk away) into the city (~10 min ride - MUCH better than driving/parking).  Breakfast was also a nice touch! The neighbourhood around her house is quiet, but the proximity to main streets came in handy for getting there."

Étant les deux seules pièces du dernier étage, on a presque l'impression d'avoir un appartement privé complet! Le reste de la maison est magnifique et Evelyn, même si elle s'est fait discrète lors de notre séjour, est très accueillante et accommodante. Nous avons beaucoup apprécié le petit déjeuner qu'elle laissait pour nous le matin dans la cuisine, ainsi que la proximité du T (subway) à 5-6 min de marche.

Evelyn provided a range of breakfast options for us in the morning, and was available for guidance on local attractions, etc. The house is a few blocks from the Orange Line Stony Brook T station, and the location was convenient for everywhere we wanted to go. It's located in Jamaica Plain, is about 6 blocks from the free Sam Adams brewery tour, and is very safe. I'm glad we stayed there, and we would not hesitate to book with Evelyn again."

Evelyn provided suggestions of where to go in Boston and each morning she set out breakfast items for us.  The area is convenient walking distance to the T line yet in a family friendly neighborhood.  Love the older homes in Jamaica Plain and exploring the area.

4000384,67038508,2016-03-26,13548511,Zack,"Evelyn's home is absolutely incredible! The stay was very comfortable and the accommodations cannot be any better. The room itself is cozy with the most comfortable mattress you will sleep on in your entire life. It's situated on the top floor which you get to yourself and you are greeted every time you walk through the front door by Kobe, the friendly dog. Evelyn also lays out breakfast every morning which makes for an incredible stay! If all listings were like Evelyn's, the world would be a happier place."

4000384,68832141,2016-04-07,47096003,Deborah,Staying with Evelyn was wonderful! My husband and I really needed a quiet place to get away and Evelyn's home was perfect. Evelyn was very knowledgeable about the area and recommended some great restaurants for us to try. Her neighborhood is really nice and only a short walk to the subway. Our room was amazing! The room itself is on the third floor and it has a large private bathroom. The bed was large and very comfortable. Evelyn gave us a key to the front door so we could come and go as we pleased. Evelyn also has the cutest dog named Kobe who greeted us every time we came home and she was so kind to lay out a healthy breakfast for us each morning. I would not hesitate to stay with Evelyn again. We came back rested from our vacation and plan on visiting again.
4000384,71451599,2016-04-25,32017621,Caroline,"Evelyn was a wonderful and accommodating host. The room was amazing, roomy, and comfortable. We had the upstairs to ourselves with a private and large bathroom. The neighborhood was quiet and was close to the orange line. Evelyn provided us with breakfast everyday we were there and we were not left wanting. She also has a very friendly dog, Kobe, who would greet us whenever we get back. We highly recommend staying at her place and would stay again. Thank you again Evelyn!"

4000384,86322918,2016-07-16,41401704,Courtney,"We had a great stay in JP at Evelyn's lovely home. She was very hospitable. Her home was very convenient with access to the T and local shops/restaurants. The heat was up in Boston during the week of our stay, but the A/C window units kept our part of the house very cool and comfortable. The wifi was efficient for my daughter's need to netflix. Parking was easy at Evelyn's, and we only used the car on two occasions when we decided to drive to a nearby restaurant in JP. The area seemed very safe and secure.  We walked to and from the subway each morning and afternoon without concerns. Thank you, Evelyn, for making our first time in Boston a great one. We will definitely be back."
4000384,87698437,2016-07-21,60538632,Shelby,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was far better than we had ever dreamed. Upon our arrival, which was a little later in the evening due to delays in our flights, we were greeted by Evelyn as well as her sweet dog, Kobe. Evelyn showed us to our room, as well as private bathroom, which was on the 3rd floor of her beautiful Victorian home. She gave us maps as well as brochures of things to do while in the city. The train station was a few blocks away from the house which was very convenient. Each morning there was an assortment of bagels, fruit, yogurt, cereal, juice, and coffee that was left out for our enjoyment. Definitely gave it the bed and breakfast feel! If you are ever in the Boston area you must stay with Evelyn. 5 stars for location as well as hospitality. Thank you Evelyn for such a wonderful stay!"
4000384,88826714,2016-07-25,76015015,Michele,"It was a pleasure to stay in such a wonderful home. Evelyn was a great hostess that made sure our stay was comfortable and enjoyable.

The room is big, comfortable, the private bathroom is so beautiful, a luxury treat and so was the breakfast Evelyn arranged for us in the morning. Evelyn has been Kind and helpful to us, she has Many useful maps and info to get along in the city. Last but not least, Kobe the dog is simply adorable."
4000384,92214556,2016-08-08,10734327,Joel,The room is nice and very private since you have a whole floor to yourself. The bathroom was ginormous. And Evelyn put out a very large spread for breakfast.
4000384,93271944,2016-08-12,57120983,Sarah,"Evelyn was a fabulous host, her home is stylish and homely; everything exceeded expectations. The room and bathroom were on the attic floor, and was like a private suite. One night I couldn't sleep (jet lag), and it was great to be able to go into the luxury bathroom, curl up on a lovely armchair and read without waking my husband. Evelyn left continental breakfast out for us every morning, all fresh and lovely. Kobe the dog was adorable, it was all I could do to stop myself dognapping him...  Jamaica Plain town was a bit of a disappointment but we found a good restaurant and cafe at the Brewery. It was about 20 mins by T (the underground train) from Evelyn's house to Boston centre - really easy journey.  All in all would highly recommend."
4000384,95643822,2016-08-20,75582462,迺惠,The house is nice and it is only a five minute walk from the subway station. Evelyn made us breakfast for us every morning and is extremely hospitable. We enjoyed our stay and would definite recommend this place for those who will be planning to visit Boston.
6453686,34042085,2015-06-03,34670294,Birju,"This stay at Son's apt was my first Airbnb experience and what a great one it was! Being Son's first time as well, he was always just a text away if I had any questions or problems."
We booked his apt just a day before we were to stay in Boston. Son was quick in his responses and easy to get a hold of. He met us at the building with keys and simple instructions to leave them in the apt when we checked-out.,,,,,
The apt is in a safe area where there are lots of young students,faces Fenway Park,and is near another large garden/park. The location was within similar walking distance to either the Hynes Convention Ctr station or Fenway Park station. About a 7-8 min walk. Not bad but we did get caught in the rain so do consider that.,,,
The building the apt is in is an old one but has elevator access. A pretty vintage one that zips you up to the 3rd floor apt. The apt is larger than a studio with a bedroom,bathroom,hall,and closet. That's it and that's all we needed. Son had taken care to keep it clean and had fresh,new towels and soap ready for our arrival (last minute booking that it was). The bed was comfortable but a bit firm,which I like but beware. The view out to Fenway Park from the bedroom is just awesome at night. Bathroom was small but had plenty of hot running water and a good size shower. We didn't use the kitchen much but we had access to a stove and fridge as well.
We only had one issue with our stay. The apt had just gotten set up with wi-fi access but wasn't working. Son had to call the cable company tech to come out again but it wouldn't be fixed til our 2nd day there. No worries. We were at this apt for 2 days to explore Boston and we didn't spend much time at the apt during the day anyway. I just appreciated that Son felt bad that we were having trouble accessing it and did his best to resolve the issue in a timely manner as he could.,,,,,
When we checked out,we just left the keys behind. Thanks,Son,for making our first Airbnb experience a great one,"and hope it went well for you too!\"",
6453686,34566850,2015-06-09,22573767,Jawwad,The apartment was very conveniently located close to Boston University and was a short walk to major shopping area on Newbury! Or Über it anywhere and it didn't cost much. Really allowed to have a great Boston experience.
6453686,35587920,2015-06-20,5691118,Alberto,"Centrally located, this apartment is easily accessible from the T stop, and has a wide range of eating opions within walking distance. All the amenities are as described an a very well appointed and spacious apartment for the Boston area. Son was very organized, welcoming and thoughtful. He checked in on me to make sure I was enjoying my stay. I would definitely stay here again!"

6453686,36692157,2015-06-30,4069838,Cammy,The service from the host was excellent! They were very attentive to our needs and made sure that our stay was pleasant.
However there were a couple of things in the apartment that needed fixing: table drawer and wooden slat from the bed were broken; the hose from inside the toilet kept sliding out of the tube,so you had to fix it occasionally when you flushed.,,,,
"Overall it was a good stay but could have been even better if things were fixed before our stay.\"",,,,,
6453686,37481867,2015-07-07,34781893,Janee,This was my first time trying airbnb and Stephanie made it a wonderful experience. She was a great host. I couldn't have asked for a better stay.
6453686,38137104,2015-07-13,21363883,Melissa,I had a fantastic stay at this apt; Son was an amazing host.  Communication with him prior/during/after my stay was great.  I really enjoyed the space and the location was perfect.
Unfortunately,the Red Sox lost to the Yankees during my stay,but that was outside of the host's control.,,,
I would definitely recommend this space to anyone looking to visit Boston.  Truthfully,one of my best experiences with airbnb.,,,,
"Thank you!\"",,,,,
6453686,39307370,2015-07-22,35919840,Sonia,"My friend and i stayed at Son and Stephanie' place for couple of days. We had a blast, the location is perfect, very accessible. The place is small but hey! We weren't there to stay in. We enjoy and recommand this place. The only thing is that there s no parking... Thanks for everything!!!"
6453686,39768270,2015-07-26,25869008,Blake,"Great experience! The apartment was even nicer than pictured. Communication was excellent and the process for getting the keys was painless. The location is amazing so close to Fenway, food and shops. You truly to get to see Boston from the local prospective. Everything we needed is the apartment was provided as well as a map and recommendations of things to do. Safe neighborhood, can be somewhat loud but,I would for sure stay here again."
6453686,40216780,2015-07-29,34318951,William,Stayed at this place for a couple days and couldn't be happier... It is minutes away from Fenway Park which made going to and from the stadium a dream.
The apartment is a short walk away from several places to eat as well as a pharmacy should you need anything else.,,,,,
Communication with the hosts was great prior to and throughout as they left contact information should any issues arrive. The place was very clean and everything was advertised correctly.,,,,,
Not to mention they told us about an airport shuttle which saved us a significant amount of money on our ride back to the airport!,,,,,
"If I ever make my way out to Boston again I would certainly look to stay here again in a heartbeat.\"",,,,,
6453686,40596122,2015-08-01,34929652,Amie,We had a great time at Son and Steph's. Thank you for having us and with directions and tips to the train stations. Uber was very useful too in this area and surrounding bars/restaurants were a plus too!

6453686,41227328,2015-08-05,36866469,Brian,"Son and Stephanie were great hosts. We arrived late into the night due to a delayed flight but were graciously greeted. The apartment is cozy as one expects from a studio, however it is perfect for those who will be active and use the place as a home base for their adventures. Cozy as it is, it did not feel cramped for me and my wife and provided all of the necessities that were needed while being conveniently located to get anywhere you need around Boston. Highly recommended."

6453686,43922873,2015-08-23,15876035,Patrick,"Son was a lifesaver! My brother locked us out of the apartment and Son was able to get the key back for us no problem, allowing us to not have to change plans."
The apartment itself was great for the price and the location can't be beat!  Easy to make ourselves at home and it was great to come and leave as we saw fit.,,,,,
"If you want to go out and enjoy a Red Sox game to fullest ability I would highly recommend this place!\"",,,,,
6453686,44542706,2015-08-27,15725771,Julie,The studio is quite spacious and in a nice neighborhood. It's near 2 museums and the mapparium (which is worth a visit) and near a nice shopping street (Newbury street) and good restaurants.
Even though we didn't really use the kitchen,it looked like you could prepare some nice meals in there as there is all kitchenware you need.,,,,
Everything we needed in the apartment (such as shampoo,soap,towels and so on) was provided.,,,
Son was very kind and helpful and always very quick in answering our messages (before/during/after our stay).,,,,,

L'appartement est propre,confortable,avec une bonne aération (air conditionné) et correctement équipé (la cuisine est bien pensé et suffisamment équipé).,,,
Il s'agit d'un immeuble occupé par des étudiants,nous sommes arrivés lors de la rentrée scolaire et les couloirs étaient jonchés de cartons vides et d'ordures.,,,,
Son était bien présent à l'heure pour nous accueillir,par contre il ne nous a pas particulièrement aidé pendant le séjour (lorsque nous l'avons contacté pour une question,il nous a renvoyé vers la description déjà présente sur le site airbnb...),,,
Le logement a parfaitement répondu à notre besoin lors de notre séjour de 3 jours.,,,,,

The apartment is spacious and comfortable and had everything we needed and more! (the snacks and candy were a great touch!) Having toiletries and other essentials was useful too.
Son massively helped us out by letting us check out late which meant we were able to fully enjoy our last day before our night flight . Thanks!,,,,,

Tiene de todo. Plancha. Secador de pelo. Shampoo crema de enjuague hasta comida para el desayuno. El lugar también es genial. Cerca del parque lugares para cenar y tiendas.  Muchas gracias ppr todo!!!
6453686,75293063,2016-05-20,58079703,Isaac,"Son was a great host through out the whole stay, he would send me a text every other day asking if I needed anything for the apartment that I might of ran out of. I really appreciated that very much. The apartment is everything I expected nice, clean, and a really comfortable bed. The neighborhood was quiet and close to lots of bars and restaurant. If I ever come back to Boston I will stay here again."
6453686,76166779,2016-05-25,60524057,Charity,"Son was great! We chose this apartment primarily for its proximity to Fenway- it was prefect! We had a wonderful time in Boston, in part because of our stay at Son's. The apartment was clean, (but certainly and older Boston apartment) There were plenty of linens and other necessities, including kitchen items. We felt safe walking around at night and were able to catch a couple of games and enjoyed the wonderfully short walk home afterwards! Thanks Son!"
6453686,78857890,2016-06-09,34999441,Mandy,"We had a great stay in the apartment. It is exactly as advertised and in a cool location with a view on Fenway park. Son was a good host, he met us at the apartment and was available for questions. We would recommend a stay there."
6453686,79671924,2016-06-13,2629958,Edward,Son's place was great. View of Fenway Park from the bedroom window.  He was always checking in via text to ensure things were going smoothly.  Very clean and conveniently located.
6453686,80733136,2016-06-19,4636270,Case,"Son's apartment is perfect! Great location, very clean and everything you need. Communication with Son was fast and easy. Dream play to stay if you're a Red Sox fan. Would definitely stay there again. Can't go wrong!"
6453686,81885994,2016-06-25,21160038,Véronique,Nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans le studio de Son. Il s'est montré très disponible dès que nous avions une question avant et pendant le séjour.
L'appartement est très mignon,il n'est pas sans rappeler le charme des appartements parisiens. Il était propre et bien décoré. Nous avons apprécié l'air conditionné (en contrepartie prévoir les boules Quiès pour le bruit que cela occasionne; il y a également une autoroute à proximité).,,,,
L'appartement est bien situé,non loin de parcs et des musées qui valent le détour (notamment Isabella Stuart Gardner). Nous avons apprécié voir un match de baseball aussi facilement (Fenway park est juste à côté,on le voit depuis la fenêtre!) et nous mêler à la foule des fans des Redsox. Cet engouement était très impressionnant,une véritable institution à Boston!,,
La ligne verte du métro mène facilement au centre historique.,,,,,
"Merci Son pour l'accueil!\"",,,,,
6453686,84360147,2016-07-06,48851088,Megan,"My guests had a wonderful time, thought the apartment was in great condition, in a nice location and that the host was great to work with!"
6453686,85886232,2016-07-13,70917720,Mauro,Son was a perfect host! Everything worked out fine. The apartment is close to the subway and everything else was just as advertised. We enjoyed our stay at Sons place!
6453686,86591548,2016-07-17,29147083,Doug,"Everything was just as described, and Son made this experience super easy. No problems whatsoever. Highly recommended!!!"
6453686,87570281,2016-07-20,56712065,Calvin,"He was absolutely the best host. Place was very nice, perfect for Fenway baseball games. Son would check in with us to make sure everything was perfect and it was perfect."
6453686,89743933,2016-07-29,40800225,Julie,"I can't say enough excellent things about Son and his charming place. What a perfect way to see Boston, and what a kind, gracious host! Thank you, sir!"
6453686,90286787,2016-07-31,40800225,Julie,"I booked twice for the same week, and as I previously said, I can't say enough great things about my stay!"
6453686,92446357,2016-08-08,5837048,Chantal,Perfect appt. Clean right next to fenway.. We had an amazing time. The decoration is cute and fun with all the maps on the wall. Tiny but all you need is there. Thank u Son
6453686,94345457,2016-08-15,70855258,Sarah,Great place to stay for any Red Sox fan! We had a great time and the space was perfect for what we needed. We only planned to attend 1 game at Fenway but because it was right outside our bedroom window we went to 3 games! We loved Boston so much that we would want a different feel next time we come otherwise we would consider staying here again. Boston is a great city with a lot of unique experiences to offer.
"Son was extremely nice and readily available. I really appreciated his quick responses to texts regarding my inquiries. Great Host!\"",,,,,
6453686,95243360,2016-08-19,47758919,Tim,"I couldn't ask for a better place than Son's studio during my stay at Boston.  It is right next to Fenway park if you're into baseball and close to the subway.  The pictures are accurate and the studio was very clean.  My fiance and I had a great time in Boston and was very glad to have his studio during our 4 day stay.  The only downside is parking, but thats not at this studio's fault, its Boston in general.  Almost every damn street in Boston is resident parking only so you have to place your car in a garage.  Cheapest is $22/day at GREEN ST GARAGE NEAR MIT.  Just use the subway and $6/day rental bikes thats all over Boston.  Everything else was fantastic!"
4518380,23140211,2014-11-23,2874807,Trevor,"We actually were upgraded to the McPhee location in the North End which was a great location.   Comfortable accommodations and convenient!  Had a great time in Boston, thanks!"
4518380,24008065,2014-12-16,2849993,Andrea,"This was a great place to stay in Boston! We had a holiday party in the city on a work night and decided to stay here with another couple to spare the commute back to the suburbs. The apartment is GREAT! Literally everything you'd need is there - towels, iron, clean linens, dish-ware,wi-fi etc. Amazing location!"
4518380,24273526,2014-12-24,23949694,Catarina,"Great apartment, very confortable and clean. The location was perfect and the area was very safe. Perfect place to stay in Boston!"
4518380,24395263,2014-12-27,1026395,Henri,Excellent value for money because of 2 nice bedrooms with very good beds.
4518380,25029806,2015-01-05,23955756,Jason,I was actually upgraded to the North End location at 16 Battery St. The place was great and I had a wonderful stay in Boston. 10/10 would recommend.
"Great location with its easy access to tons of eating places and the subway to get to anywhere else you need to go.\"",,,,,
4518380,27638677,2015-03-09,19182222,Abbigale,We did not stay in the apartment in the pictures; we stayed in a different location in North End.
The host is a property management group that we had minimal contact with,but that contact we did have was the perfect,just enough to let us get in and on with our vacation.,,,
Our North End location was literally around the corner from all the amazing shops in Little Italy.  My Cousin's Place is a half block away and it's a ten minute walk to the Haymarket T stop (as well as a bunch of cabs driving around).  There was even a Farmer's Market by the station on Saturday and the produce was so cheap it made my heart hurt.,,,,,
The apartment itself is nice,there are two bedrooms,one with a queen bed and a second with TWO queen beds into it,as well as a futon out in the living room.  Some cooking essentials are in the kitchen,which is always appreciated even though we ended up not having time to cook.  The host also leaves shampoo,soap
As usual with AirBnB,"I am very happy with my stay and would surely consider this location again.\"",,,,
4518380,27918886,2015-03-15,23500472,Jennifer,Stayed at the 16 Battery location and it was nice and cozy. The two bedrooms and three queen beds made it a comfortable stay for me and my friends.
4518380,30440747,2015-04-22,26182107,Donald,"We actually stayed at Cindy's apartment on Battery Street, and though the ceilings were low for my 6 foot plus son, the apartment and location were wonderful. We were close to the wharf and so many wonderful restaurants, it was tough just picking places to eat with so many choices."
Though the map appeared to show a different perspective of distance,everything we needed was very close and easy to get to. A very quiet neighborhood and a wonderful stay.,,,,
"I loved being so close to the North Church and getting to see the Paul Revere reenactment on Patriot's weekend.\"",,,,,
4518380,31094029,2015-05-02,16744376,Marlene,"We get upgraded to an appartment in the north end. Key pick up was very easy, the appartment was great. A lot of space :) we got very good restaurant tipps and erverything worekd out very easy :)"
4518380,42154487,2015-08-11,9689365,Julia,"Apartment was basement level with very little light. I would set a morning alarm if you want to be out at a decent time. It had everything we needed and was very clean. The place is funky, but what historical  building isn't?"
Check in and out was easy and right around the corner. Host also offered to let us store luggage which was amazing for check out day with an evening flight.,,,,,
"Fun place. I would definitely stay again.\"",,,,,
4518380,46066172,2015-09-07,1160965,Mayumi,The location was ideal and the hosts made everything very easy for check-in and check-out. Loved the fact that we could walk to Fanieul Hall and North End. Parking was not the easiest though.
4518380,47457072,2015-09-19,29539007,Pat,"We were never contacted by the host when we arrived, or anytime during our visit.   We were not able to stay in the unit pictured but one on the Northend.  It was not as pleasant as the one pictured.  We were told it had 5-6 steps to go down but it actually had 11 steps! It was dark with small windows that looked out on a dirty alley, one window was covered with plastic and duct tape.  The location was very good!  Wish the actual unit would have been viewable before accepting it, perhaps our decision would have been different and less disappointing."
4518380,78104186,2016-06-05,57947978,Samuel Alberto,"El anfitrión siempre estuvo al pendiente de las necesidades que teníamos para la renta del apartamento, contestó siempre puntual, la recolección de llaves y entrega fueron inmediatos. El departamento en excelentes condiciones, el barrio italiano, maravilloso, y cerca de grandes lugares. Una experiencia maravillosa y que sin duda repetiría."

11992431,72609634,2016-05-03,43934510,Jabin,"It's my pleasure to write this review about my host Rafael, Rio & their beautiful apartment in Boston. I was currently in the US for a few months completing an internship in NY & Boston at Mass General Hospital. I needed a place to stay for an entire  month in Boston & found Rafael's place to be fairly inexpensive, conveniently located and Rafael seemed to be a nice & respectful guy. He was very quick to reply to my AirBNB messages, making me feel more at ease."
When I arrived Rafael was pleasant,courteous and helpful. I was a bit shy at first and Rafael respected my privacy. He made sure I had everything I needed & respected my privacy. After a few days I opened up a bit & discovered what an awesome host Raf was. He owns the house and lives on the first floor apartment. His apartment is very nice,spacious and was always kept clean & organized. The bedroom he rents to AirBNB guests is great!! Big comfortable bed,a good sized closet & windows.,,
The apartment is about a 10-15 minutes walk to the Fields Corner T station or if you don't want to walk much a 2 minute walk to the bus stop. It's about a 7 minute walk from the commuter rail which stops at South Station in Boston. Very convenient for the price. The house is next to a  basketball court & a park.,,,,,
Since I was staying a month Rafael allowed me to use his washer and dryer & kitchen freely.,,,,,
Rafael himself is a successful business man and knows Boston very well. I asked him for recommendations and he took his time to make sure I had a good itinerary for sightseeing. He's a very nice guy & a fantastic host! Then there's Rio... my new favorite dog! He's the sweetest & most lovable dog I've ever met - big personality!,,,,,
"Overall this place was incredible for the price I paid. I strongly recommend Rafael & Rio's place on your next visit to Boston.\"",,,,,
11992431,75487933,2016-05-21,64607443,Nadezhda,"Rafael is the best host we have ever stayed in. His pet dog Rio is so amazingly friendly that sometimes it seemed he was a human. We really fell in love with him. The bed is great, the room is cozy. Apartments are located in the convenient place. You can easily get to downtown by metro. Last dinner that Rafael cooked for us was fantastic. Thank you Rafael!"
11992431,76574137,2016-05-28,32804685,Andres,"Staying at Rafael's was a great experience. The room and apartment is clean, comfortable. The kitchen is furnished and completely functional."
The apartment is conveniently located near the red line and multiple grocery stores.,,,,,
"Rafael is extremely helpful and a great host. \"",,,,,
11992431,77922713,2016-06-04,2589541,Sven,Rafael is the nicest guy in Boston! We had a wonderful stay at his beautiful house while he helped us in any way to enjoy the city. He is fun talking to and has a lot of knowledge to share. See you next time!
11992431,79912347,2016-06-14,70494832,Celine-Aimee,Rafeal was amazing. We stayed with him for 2 nights so we sadly didn't have a lot of time but he made a complete ittanary for us so we could maximize our time in the city. He didn't have time to cook for us so he gave us gift cards for his restaurant which was amazing.
My husband enjoyed watching game of thrones with him and the last night we all stayed up talking for a few hours. Rafael was an amazing host,his house was clean and tidy,"and the bed very comfortable. I would definitely stay with him again and recommend his place to anyone I know.\"",,,
11992431,81102157,2016-06-21,23197296,Mélissa,Rafael nous a reçu à pied-levé suite à une mauvaise expérience dans un autre endroit réservé sur AIR BnB pour le weekend. Nous sommes arrivés à l'autre réservation et l'endroit était inacceptable pour nous.
Nous avons pris une chance et communiqué avec Rafael le soir même à 20h00 et il a accepté que nous allions visiter sa maison. Il nous a accueilli chaleureusement,nous a renseigné sur le quartier pour nous aider à faire un choix éclairé.,,,,
L'appartement est entretenu avec soin,la chambre qui nous était dédiée est sympathique. Le lit est très confortable. Le quartier a été bruyant la première nuit mais le reste du weekend a été reposant.,,,,
Rafael a été un hôte extra malgré qu'il n'attendait pas de visiteurs ce weekend là. Il nous a conseillé des lieux à visiter et nous a indiqué des stationnements publics bien situés en lien avec les activités que nous avions réservé. (RedSox et spectacle de musique dans le Blue Hill Pavillon).,,,,,
Nous retournerions sans aucun doute habiter chez Rafael. C'est un gars vraiment gentil et super accueillant.,,,,,
Nul doute : Rafael a sauvé notre weekend à Boston suite à la mauvaise surprise du premier endroit que nous avions réservé. Espérons maintenant que AirBNB nous rembourse notre première location.,,,,,
"Merci Rafael de ton hospitalité! On garde un super souvenir de notre séjour à Boston grâce à toi!\"",,,,,
11992431,83124720,2016-07-01,20806695,Roan,"Rafael was a really great host, cordial and considerate.  The apartment was clean we had a lovely room to ourselves.  Rafael gave some great advise of how to get around the area as well as things to do there.  We were a little apprehensive about the neighborhood at first, but once we got acclimated we realized that even though it's a little loud, the people are really nice, kids playing all the time and very enjoyable."
Public transit takes about an hour to get anywhere but bring a book and enjoy the ride.,,,,,
I would highly recommend Rafael as a guest and host,"and his apartment is great.\"",,,,
11992431,84856803,2016-07-09,53737818,Jessica,"Rafael was extremely nice and knowledgeable! Though he wasn't there when we arrived, he still communicated beforehand and made sure everything went smoothly!"
He also gave great advice about where to visit and eat in Boston,which was great because it helps a lot when you're trying to plan your days! Additionally,he was always there to reply to any questions or messages I have.,,,
"I would definitely recommend anyone who wants to stay in Boston and feel like you're staying at a friend's!\"",,,,,
11992431,91687300,2016-08-06,79397649,Jose,"I stayed at Rafaels place for a whole month and I felt comfortable the entire time. As soon as you arrive Rafael will check up on you and see if you have everything you need. The room and bed is comfortable and clean with nice sheets and extra towels, accurate to what the pictures show. The living room and kitchen is always available if you need it but I was mostly out for work so I didn't use them much. Rafael was nice enough to give me some fridge space since my stay was so long and would come home hungry. He also offered me food whenever he would cook; he cooks a lot and its always delicious. If you have any questions about where to go and how, Rafael will definitely help you."
I drove every day so I didn't use public transportation. The place has space in the back for a couple of cars,three with a tight fit. There is also always street parking next to the park so i never had an issue.,,,,
"Rio is a good dog and also deserves a good review. \"",,,,,
11992431,96629929,2016-08-23,65368694,Hanna,"Rafael was a great host! Though he wasn't home for the week we stayed at the bnb, he did a great job communicating with us and was overall very kind. The house was very clean, especially the kitchen and the bathroom!! The neighborhood was a bit scary at night, however, it was very convenient getting in and out downtown Boston and the surrounding areas. 5 stars for the host!"
11992431,97773925,2016-08-28,21388123,Alex,Rafael contacted me promptly and made sure I had all the necessary information for a smooth and pleasant stay in Boston!
11992431,98737651,2016-09-01,53459170,Leslie,"For any solo female travelers looking for a safe, comfortable, and private place to stay this is your spot!"
My time at Rafael's house was one of my best airbnb experiences so far.  The pictures of Rafael's home are exactly as they appear online.  I was a bit stressed during my stay in Boston and Rafael really make me feel at home,relaxed,"and comfortable.  The first morning I was there he made breakfast and we had a nice conversation with coffee.  That same day he offered to drive me into Cambridge as he had a meeting in the same area. This was a huge help and it allowed me to see more of the city. I was also able to use his washer and dryer which was a great as i'd been traveling for several days.  I highly recommend anyone to stay with Rafael if you need accommodation in Boston.  If you are lucky enough you'll get to meet his adorable (dog smell free) dog Rio who is just as sweet as Rafael!\"",,,

12708781,74107273,2016-05-13,71276348,Theo,"Right from the initial contact I knew Alex would be a welcoming host. I got a call from my uncle who said he and his family (wife and 2 kids) are making a surprise trip to visit me in Boston. I reached out to Alex and within minutes, got a response from him informing me that he would be glad to accommodate my uncle and his family --- that same day! Alex asked for 2 hours so that he can tidy up and get the place ready. Considering that it was a same day booking, I was so amazed to show up with my uncle & his family to a clean, beautiful, and cozy home. It was exactly as described. The neighborhood was so quiet and peaceful. The house was tastefully furnished; the bedrooms were nicely proportioned. The backyard was perfect for my uncle's kids. There was central air conditioning in the house, making the stay comfortable, even during those hot days. From the beginning to end, Alex was easy to communicate with, emails & texts are usually answered withhin minutes. Very responsive!! I would definitely book Alex's place again if my uncle & his family (or any out of town friends for that matter) ever come back to visit."
12708781,76016680,2016-05-24,44015831,Bruce,We had a good time at this home. Alex welcomed us with a bright and energetic smile and a small welcome gift of a beautiful Mango cake. During our stay there was a small problem and Alex was extremely responsive and fixed the problem within a half hour. Alex's personality and knowledge of the area made this experience even better than we hoped it would be.
12708781,76551785,2016-05-28,71148766,Χρηστος,"The house was absolutely perfect. First of all Alex was helpful and responded immediately to every inquiry I had. The house was spacious, well furnished and equipped with anything you might need regardless if your stay will be short or long. The house was perfectly cleaned. The kitchen was equipped with with every appliance we might need. Everything in the appartment was so brand new that seemed as if we were the first ones to use it. From the kitchen appliances, to the beds, to the sofas in the living room (absolutely great sofas!!). Furthermore the furnishing of the appartment was modern, tasteful and useful. After my stay at Alex's house I cannot think of something that was not perfect. Additionaly there was a couple of things like the huge TVs, the convenient combination lock in the front door and the shophisticated thermostat that stood out even further to how much effort Alex put to make our stay there perfect. Thank you very much Alex!"
12708781,78593843,2016-06-07,40642835,Jing,"The place is lovely and spacious. Alex is a very nice host. He contacted me before I arrive and he provided very detailed instruction about how to access to the property. He also stored a pack of bottle water in the fridge for us. The property is conveniently located, close to Boston College. There are several supermarkets and restaurants near the neighborhood."
12708781,79751120,2016-06-14,32414827,Stefan,We had an excellent experience with Alex. They really do their best to make you feel comfortable. I won't even get started on all the nice things they have done for us (that really aren't required for an AirBnB host) but we could tell they wanted to make us feel comfortable.
Also,since we were there they got super highspeed internet,"which everyone who uses the internet frequently will enjoy\"",,,

He was also extremely helpful in giving tips on getting around Boston, and things to do."
"The house itself was perfect for our family - modern appliances etc and to a hi spec -  and is in a great location for Boston - only 15 mins by car to Boston city centre - and surrounding areas. Just sorry we didn't have time to use the new BBQ Alex had bought.\"",,,,,
12708781,85093267,2016-07-10,16529829,Jen,"My stay at Alex's Airbnb was amazing from start to finish. Before my friends and I even arrived, Alex made himself available to us, checking in to see that we've arrived okay and had everything we need. I mentioned to Alex ahead of our arrival that we plan to grill one of the nights we'll be there and he made sure we knew where everything was."
Walking in,everything was exactly like the photos depicted. It was clean and bright,and each bed came with folded bath towels and travel sized toiletries.,,,

First of all,the house where the transportation is convenient,the life also is very convenient。,,,
Alex is a super sweet super warm a person! He prepared for us not only a fridge full of food and water to welcome us,and we also found that the Asian people use electric rice cooker,rice,all kinds of Asian seasoning,all we think about and never thought of,more let's surprise

The few decorations were tasteful and well-placed. The full kitchen had everything we needed to prepare meals (except a potato peeler!). The bedrooms were a nice size (one had two full-size beds and still plenty of space). Lots of natural light in the rooms. The location was superb, the street is one-way, but easily accessed. It's a block away from the parkway into downtown Boston (20 minute drive) and two blocks away from 2 different bus stops (51 & 37). Two grocery stores and Centre St. are a 5 minute drive away. Located in a residential neighborhood, we met some of the neighbors who were super friendly. All in all, the house was ideally situated for us and Alex was a superb host."

The terrace is unbelievable and the location can't be beat if you're looking for something in the area of the BCEC.  The view from the bedroom is only rivaled by the ridiculous comfort of the bed.  Slept like a baby.  Max was super communicative and very accommodating.  Was a wonderful place to spend a weekend."

It's half a mile from the Boston Convention Center, so very convenient for conference goers. Max was very friendly and has lovely furniture and artwork in his place, plus a grill, heater and full couch on his patio. The sunrises are exquisite. We also enjoyed the huge lounge down the hall, which has million-dollar panorama views of Boston's skyline, a pool table, a full kitchen and a huge furnished patio. The neighborhood is great, lots of restaurants and a grocery store down the block. A great experience, one we would happily repeat the next time we're in Boston. Thanks Max!!"

Max was an awesome host who was easy to contact and immediately responsive,,,,,
"to any questions.  He had a fridge a full of drinks and snacks and one of his best tips was to use uber or uberx to get around Boston.  The apartment is very comfortable with a great view of the harbor from the terrace.  The people at the front desk were all very friendly and helpful. Easy walking distance to some great restaurants.  We will  definitely  plan on staying again next time we are in Boston!\"",,,,,
2384107,14627995,2014-06-23,15810254,Karen,"Max was very responsive, professional and friendly.  He answered our emails right away and was flexible in meeting our requests.  The apartment was spotlessly cleaned, sun-filled and with amazing views, as advertised. All private (in the apartment) and public (in the building) amenities were exactly as described (or better!). The restaurant across the street although not particularly impressive from the outside, lived up to its great reputation for a chic atmosphere and amazing food.  The small market/wine shop on the next block was a convenient bonus."

The apt is really bright, clean and spacious and Max was very welcoming with his instructions. The concierge staff were also really friendly and helpful."

Max was very welcoming.  Even though he was out of town for the weekend he made sure we were able to check in and out at a time convenient for us, and called to make sure everything was okay.  He offered us a bottle of wine and some excellent advice on dining in the area.  As a bonus, the conference center is just blocks away, an easy walk."
2384107,21397778,2014-10-16,22067344,Kay,"Max made me feel very welcome and made sure I had directions to the apt, and suggestions for local restaurants.  I couldn't figure out where to put the water in the coffee maker and he got right back to me to guide me through it. The apt has super light and the floor to ceiling windows and deck makes the place feel very spacious and contemporary.   The neighborhood  felt convenient and safe."
2384107,22582113,2014-11-10,5461138,Brit,Max made us feel right at home during our stay in Boston. He made sure we arrived safely and knew exactly how to get in when we arrived. The listing was even better than we had anticipated. His apartment had wildly clever and carefully chosen decor. During our stay I messaged max to see where his favorite restaurants and bars were around the area. He directed us to some fabulous food and drinks! I would absolutely recommend staying at Max's when you're in Boston!
2384107,28934065,2015-04-01,16128406,Caitlin,"We just returned from Boston and feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to stay at Max's beautiful apartment.  Max was very welcoming and his apartment was walking distance from everything we could have needed on our trip.  Max made check in incredibly easy and left us some tips for some great dining in Boston. I can not imagine a better place to have stayed on our trip or a better host for a first-timer in Boston.  Thank you, Max"

Max was accommodating to my arrival time and a all around genuine person.Upon arrival at the penthouse I felt right at home . The house was asthetically pleasing with great artwork throughout the house . Everything was on point from the cleanliness to the large deck overlooking south Boston  . The price exceeded the value . I would defineitly rent this place again next time I am in Boston .
2384107,87700970,2016-07-21,82540954,Randy,Max provided great communication from the start and made my first Airbnb experience nice and easy. Thanks for the great place to chill out and get my work trip done.
2384107,92602566,2016-08-09,31812894,Phoebe,Max's place was terrific! The location in Fort Point could not have been better. We hit as many of the neighborhood restaurants as we could and they were all within walking distance! For the cutest coffee shop around just around the corner you have to try out Nero!
The apartment was in a beautifully decorated building and parking at the near by garage was easy. The entire apartment is nice but the balcony steals the show! The views and the beautiful morning sun to enjoy your coffee with is priceless. It's well equipped with everything you need for your stay.,,,,,

Right next to Fenway T-station, walking distance to stores like Target, Star Market, Marshalls, Bed Bath & Beyond and may restaurants. It is exactly as described on Airbnb, a very quiet & spacious apartment with all necessary utilities. Very newly renovated with a gym. Parking in the area would be a problem as the near by streets with meters are reserved for resident parking only, it's even harder to get a space on the very few available meters for parking when there is game playing at Fenway."
13546070,94184555,2016-08-15,5388923,Chris,"This unit was in a clean, nice building with good amenities, including a full kitchen, gym in the building, and secure entrances. The location was perfect for what we wanted to do: very close to Fenway, the T, art museums, and good food. We arrived much earlier than expected and the host greeted us early and allowed us to leave our bags in the unit while it was being cleaned. Highly recommended!"
13546070,98331805,2016-08-30,43138863,Steve,Bean Town Suites is a great place to stay when visiting Boston for a Red Sox game! Very short walk to the ballpark and there are several great bars and restaurants along the way!

Not only did she make time to be there when I got to the address, she went out of her way to show me the room and made me feel comfortable in her home. Not only that, after the visit she carefully looked for my lost keys (which I had forgotten elsewhere in the city) and texted me that they were not in the room. The room is surprisingly spacious, with its own walk-in closet, and a ceiling fan/light with remote control. I will stay here again!"

Check-in was easy, and the hosts were very accomodating of my schedule. I was able to sleep well, the room had things I liked and overall I would stay here again if the opportunity arose. Very convenient to the airport and my conference which is what I cared about."

1644031,72258128,2016-05-01,26598804,Nancy,Brooke is in the middle of a renovation so things were a bit dusty and unsettled. Nonetheless the bedroom was spacious and street noise pretty much died down by 11 pm. Brooke is personable and accommodating.  We shared the room with a large fish tank but Brooke was willing to let us turn off the noisy aerator when we asked.
1644031,73090914,2016-05-06,1610972,Katherine,"Brooke was a nice guest & welcomed us. We were busy with a work trip, and it was fine to come & go as we needed. Convenient location to the conference hotel, and the place worked well."

Bunch of great local nightlife just a few blocks up on Broadway, and there is an amazing breakfast spot not far from there we found called My Diner. The rate is an amazing value, considering local hotels charge 3-5x a night for similar spaces. Would definitely stay again the next time we come up to Boston. Brooke was extremely accommodating, even with the fact we didn't arrive in Boston until 9PM on a Saturday Night."

It's a good spot for kids too, if they are small as there is a big yard to run around in. The A/C kept things cool at night while the available Netflix kept us entertained when coming back. The driveway is quite narrow, but I navigated with a full size Durango without issue. The neighborhood is quiet and well maintained."
6401859,83184916,2016-07-01,68538316,Ellen,"We stayed in this backyard carriage house for two nights in July. The place was clean and the air conditioner welcomed us in. The TV provided video options. Bedroom was upstairs. Unfortunately, you have to go to the main house for restroom/bathing. It was slightly awkward, but the family does a good job of letting you have your privacy. Be careful of the driveway as you will bottom out."

6401859,85755688,2016-07-13,16975323,Steph,Great- as described.
6401859,87536840,2016-07-20,18050959,Robert,Uns hat die Unterkunft sehr gefallen.
Alles war sauber und ordentlich. Im EG befindet sich ein Wohn- und Essbereich (mit Kühlschrank,Kaffemachine etc.) mit gemütlichen Möbeln. In der ersten Etage steht die Klimaanlage und das Bett.,,,,
Das Bad befindet sich im Haupthaus,welches man zu jeder Zeit betreten kann (Auf diese Situation wurde von Grace&Mark auch mehrfach hingewiesen).,,,,
Durch diese gesonderte Situation kommt man aber auch immer wieder mit Grace und Mark ins Gespräch.,,,,,
"Wir würden hier jederzeit wieder buchen.\"",,,,,
6401859,87988844,2016-07-22,38246937,Sven,We really liked the beautiful barn in the backyard of graces and marks home. Unfortunately we only stayed for one night so we couldn't enjoyed this great place more. Grace and Mark were very nice and great hosts. Everything was clean and comfy. They had an air conditioner in the bedroom to battle the hot temperatures outside so the sleep was good. We highly recommend a stay at this place. Thanks for everything you two!
6401859,89454099,2016-07-28,64968811,Salomé,Grace and Mark guest house is a really nice place to stay near Boston. They have a beautiful and well equiped garden they let you enjoy during your stay. Travelling with a little one it was really convenient for us to have access to this outdoor space!
6401859,91034748,2016-08-03,78665552,Nick,"The guest house is beautiful. Big comfy bed, a big TV with access to Netflix, a big couch... I stayed here with my girlfriend and we loved it. Grace and Mark give you a ton of privacy if you want it."
6401859,92031329,2016-08-07,81926871,John,"I had an absolutely wonderful time at Grace and Mark's carriage house.  Very nice family, and a wonderful location. No complaints whatsoever, and highly recommend!"
6401859,95192286,2016-08-18,74023930,Geraldine,Mark and Grace were excellent hosts; very quick to respond to any queries and available to speak to in person should you wish without being intrusive.
All facilities were as described and their were no issues accessing the private entrance at any time.,,,,,
At the time of writing the area is a 10 minute walk and a $9 return by rail to Boston City Centre for two people.  Trains run from early morning until 11 pm.,,,,,
Grace and Mark supplied both local and Boston Tourist Information which was very helpful as we were oversees visitors.,,,,,
We would like to thank Mark and Grace for their hospitality and a job very well done.  Thank you,,,,,

6401859,97019730,2016-08-25,49185465,Chris,"Beautiful place. The interior design was great. For the value, the best place to be in order to see Boston. Easy walk to the train station and then a 15-20 minute ride to South Station. Mark and Grace communicated via the Air BnB chat and gave us all sorts of information. Highly recommend people to stay here."
13344433,82522067,2016-06-28,1964128,Norman,"Chris was a truly awesome host. The apartment was very modern, nicely decorated and had everything you need to feel at home. Just be aware that there is no real kitchen (fridge, microwave and coffee machine is available, though). The place was very cean and dealing with Chris was as easy as it could be. I would definitely stay in this apartment again."
13344433,90573353,2016-08-01,1964128,Norman,"Chris and Jin are great hosts and the apartment is perfect. I've stayed in their apartment twice already and would definitely recommend it. Jamaica Plain is a very nice neighborhood with plenty of restaurants, bars and little shops. The subway (10 minute walk away) takes you Downtown in about 15 minutes, which makes this apartment an ideal place for visiting Boston."
13344433,91238977,2016-08-04,6787341,Sandra,"Had a lovely time in this beautiful, well-kept space. Chris is a very attentive host and was always eager to be of help."
13344433,92022710,2016-08-07,5847612,Te,"Chris and Jin are warm and respectful hosts. Their house locates in a quiet neighborhood but only 5 minutes walk to the robust central street ft. all kinds of fun boutiques and café. Rooms are on the third floor, clean, spacious, tastefully decorated with modern simplicity. Big window in the attic allowed sufficient sunshine so we woke up in the morning feeling zesty and ready. In addition, communication with our hosts since reservation has been smooth and friendly. I highly recommend their place."
13344433,93045074,2016-08-11,6604137,Jessica,Chris and Jin were kind and helpful throughout the entire reservations process. Their home was lovely and my family had a great quick trip to Boston thanks to their help. Highly recommend!
13344433,93613008,2016-08-13,45541499,Janae,"Our visit to Boston was enhanced by the stress-free accommodations that Chris and Jin provided. The cozy third floor almost spa-like environment was top notch along with the high end fixtures, gorgeous skylight view, and spacious layout. It is located in a quiet community with convenient access to many activities. Chris and Jin provided excellent recommendations for things to do and eat in the city. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it!"
13344433,94377308,2016-08-15,3293489,Cara,"Chris and Jin are incredibly accommodating, available, and helpful! The photographs simply do not do this incredible space justice.  I booked this for some out of town relatives in August 2016 since my apartment is not air conditioned. We were all overwhelmingly pleased with the booking and I will be recommending this location for out of town guests in November! Thank you Chris and Jin!"
13344433,98080003,2016-08-29,3510895,Jason,"Great location, clean space, friendly host. Would recommend to any friends staying in Boston!"
13344433,98513434,2016-08-31,86523090,Debra,"From the time I met Chris then Jin, I felt welcomed and at home. Their home is even more beautiful in person and they provided items that I was not expecting. What a pleasant surprise. The bed was so comfortable and I slept very well. I truly wish I could have stayed longer but I will be sure to look for availability in their home next time I'm in the area. I definitely recommend anyone to stay here."
12726343,74623005,2016-05-16,51601861,Michelle,"The listing description was very accurate, and the location was close to Charles Street and several historical sites. Great Location!"
24240,120062,2010-10-16,193583,Marion,"\"Really enjoyed our 2 nights on the Golden Slipper.  Although not a new boat, all mod cons are there, with lots of little touches to make life on board comfortable.   As boat owners ourselves, we thought it was excellent - and we've never seen such a huge master bed before !   Location is very good - North End of Boston, and handy for everything.  Supermarket a few minutes away, and what the Rough Guide terms \"\"the mother of all food courts\"\" just a 5-min walk away"
If using Logan Airport,a water taxi takes you right there - although allow for it being late,and you then missing the connecting shuttle bus to the airport at the other end - led to a few anxious moments !,,,
Gretchen is a very good communicator,both before and during the stay,"and very helpful.   Thoroughly recommended !\"",,,
24240,126183,2010-10-24,168330,Matt,The boat was awesome and Gretchen was a perfect host.  I would definitely stay on the Golden Slipper again.
24240,129568,2010-10-29,271188,Grace & Clinton,"The Golden Slipper is just fantastic. The boat is charming, and the whole experience couldn't have been more lovely -- excellent neighbourhood near the cute, Italian North End with lots of restaurants and cafes, and the water taxt to Logan Airport comes right to the boat! Thanks, Gretchen."
24240,135659,2010-11-08,216891,David,"Best houseboat ever!  Gretchen was very nice, and swans meet you every morning when you leave!"

24240,244795,2011-04-29,348971,Karla,"What an incredible time I had aboard the Golden Slipper!  It took a few minutes to get used to the compact quarters and a few boat 'quirks' (the maritime plumbing) and from there it was simply heavenly.  The location is as ideal as it could be for walking, supplies and peaceful floating..."
It's secure and safe too...,,,,,
I will not soon forget the fabulous sleep and relaxation aboard the Slipper.  Hanging out on the deck the sounds,sights and smells of the Harbor have a healing quality.  I have FINALLY seen the REAL Boston! Thank you Gretchen & Jack.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
24240,337051,2011-06-27,570458,Ruth,Gretchen was great.  She met us when she said she would and everything on the boat was well maintained  We enjoyed it very much
24240,535260,2011-09-15,483655,Gabriel,The Golden Slipper was a great experience. Relaxing on the back deck of the ship was so wonderful as the breezes came through the harbor. I was there for a business trip but I felt like I was on vacation! Gretchen had Meghan & Damien meet me to let me and show me around - they were both very pleasant and accommodating to my schedule as well since I booked the night before and I couldn't arrive until 9pm. The ship is also nicely located within walking distance to many restaurants and bars. If you need fast wifi though bring your own as there is an open signal from a nearby building but it is slow. I would definitely stay at the Golden Slipper again.
24240,1222255,2012-05-03,202381,Jade,"For my husband and I, staying at the Golden Slipper was a truly unique Boston experience.  Gretchen is a fabulous host who was in touch with us the entire time, making sure that we had all the info about the boat and was also a great resource for ideas and things to do/see nearby.  The location is top notch - you really can't get any better if you're wanting to stay in the North End.  And of course, its a boat, which is unique and different compared to a standard hotel room.  The amenities on the boat are great - the upper deck w/ patio furniture and blankets for evening relaxation, the comfy beds, and yummy muffins & coffee really make the stay even better.  I'd definitely recommend this place!"
24240,1264220,2012-05-11,1266004,Mian,"\"This houseboat stay was an amazing one. After the initial \"\"getting-used-to-boat-living\"\" period"
Gretchen was a very great host who did her best to accommodate to our every need - many thanks! My parents (57 and 55) and I had a great time staying here. Joe's and Legal Seafood Restaurant (2 top-notch restaurants) were nearby too,and made for really good food.,,,,
The boat itself does not have WiFi though - for your (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) and Internet needs,"you can head over to the Starbucks cafe nearby! \"",,,,
24240,1298309,2012-05-18,824351,Tracy,"I would say this is the only way to stay in Boston, the boat is moored in a perfect postion so you are able to walk to so many interesting sights and places. Gretchen was the perfect host, leaving breakfast things for us so we didn't even have to go out early on the first morning, it was such a lovely touch. Have already recommended friend to stay there. Tracy"
24240,2292361,2012-09-14,2379644,Collin,"Gretchen was available, flexible and accommodating as a host. The Golden Slipper was just lovely--everything we might have wanted, we had. The boat was clean and comfortable and very well maintained. We enjoyed our evening there and would certainly recommend it."
24240,2422433,2012-09-26,2196507,Betsy,Thank you for the lovely space Gretchen and Jack! Best way to stay in Boston hands down.
24240,6306370,2013-08-07,155043,L,"We loved our night on the Golden Slipper. We will never stay anywhere else when we come to Boston. You have to be prepared for the parking, which can be a challenge, but the boat itself is an awesome place to stay, Gretchen and her husband are very helpful and we really enjoyed our stay. The location is convenient, in the North End, very near Italian neighborhood and lots of great restaurants. We ordered takeout and had a family picnic on the deck There were 5 of us, and the only thing I would do differently is to limit the family to one small bag each."
24240,8509026,2013-11-03,5065556,Aaron,"Gretchen made us feel very welcome, provided a great overview of the Golden Slipper and some suggestions for places to visit.  A very smooth experience.  Would definitely recommend."
24240,8542263,2013-11-04,1384036,Jacob,The Golden Slipper is an extraordinary experience with local access to many spots around the Boston area.  I would highly recommend a stay at the Golden Slipper to anyone looking to break away from the monotony of hotel rooms.
"Gretchen was a great host as well which made the experience complete!\"",,,,,
24240,13128137,2014-05-20,6308277,Jen,"Gretchen was great.  She accommodated our early arrival, was very clear on operations of the boat and a pleasure to deal with.  The beds are super comfy, and the fireplace was perfect for the couple of cool evenings we had.  Our daughter having her own room and bathroom was a bonus and she loved it!"
A few minor downsides - wifi would be a must for us in the future,as well as basic t.v.  We would have loved to use the stern sitting area more,both for shade and during a bit of rain,however there was no option to put up canvas  for that.,,
"We had a truly great stay and recommend this experience! \"",,,,,
24240,18589363,2014-08-28,18286028,Scott,We had a great stay on the boat! Perfect location for a downtown stay and great back deck for wine and boat watching.
24240,21205512,2014-10-13,20175646,Sara,The Golden Slipper was great-- accurately described and in a fabulous location. We felt comfortable and very secure.
24240,31033520,2015-05-01,20968789,Scott,"My three friends and I had a wonderful time. Great location, all the amenities you need, and the host was gracious. Spending a quiet evening at the marina, relaxing on the back of the boat is the perfect way to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. Would stay again."
24240,31640113,2015-05-08,19673452,Matthew,"The boat is docked in the most perfect location in Boston imaginable. The boat is clean, comfortable, and Gretchen is a wonderful host that made the check in, check out, and boat orientation process seamlessly pleasant. Breakfast was included and contained fruits, bagels, cereal, juice, and many other things that worked both as a breakfast and as snacks."
24240,31774461,2015-05-10,27323727,Don,"Stayed on the Golden Slipper for a long weekend in Boston and it was excellent. The location could not be better for seeing the sights. One can easily walk to lots of restaurants, the Freedom Trail, and the downtown area. The train is close by for anything further. Gretchen gave us a great tour of the boat and pointed out the nearby sights before leaving us to tour Boston. We all slept amazingly well on the boat and just enjoyed the quiet, relaxing environment whenever we needed a break from sightseeing. Definitely recommended!"
24240,33278647,2015-05-26,32007779,Larry,"The Golden Slipper was a golden experience. Close to everything, water taxis at the dock whenever you need them and a host extraordinaire. Gretchen gave us the skinny on living on the boat and made us feel right at home. The locale is perfect for seeing anything in town or in the water. Magical!"
24240,34014566,2015-06-03,21753038,Bill,My wife and I had a wonderful time on The Golden Slipper. The boat is well maintained and the location can't be beat. Staying on a boat was a unique option and I highly recommend it!
"Thank you Gretchen! You are a wonderful host. \"",,,,,
24240,36863549,2015-07-02,26429809,Rebecca,"We enjoyed a brief but wonderful stay at the Golden Slipper. Gretchen met me at the wharf and was kind enough to help me get to the houseboat, as I had recently had ankle surgery. She is a gracious host, and interesting to talk to."
The boat itself is clean and stocked with everything you could want. The location is fantastic,within walking distance of many restaurants and shops. My husband and daughters walked to the TD Garden without a problem. The North End is my favorite part of Boston,so this accommodation couldn't have been in a better spot. While not quiet at night because of the usual city hubbub,once inside the boat to sleep,the noise was muted,even with windows open.
I can't recommend Gretchen or the Golden Slipper highly enough. Oh,be sure to visit the Golden Goose Market,located just across the street and through the alley! I don't even know how to begin to describe it,but it has a European vibe and offers anything you could possibly need for your stay--food of all kinds,alcohol and other beverages,toiletries
24240,38736222,2015-07-18,406671,Kurt,Great place to stay. Great location. The host was there waiting for us and walked through the layout of the boat. A comfortable place with a nice way to sleep as the boat softly rocked on the waves.
24240,40797913,2015-08-02,38191980,Elton,Gretchen was very Welcoming and was Wondering GREAT at showing us the ins and out of the boat and telling us about the area.
Dated but comfortable,and very peaceful setting,"easy access for water taxis.\"",,,
24240,43529768,2015-08-20,52140,Mike,"The area at the Wharf was safe, convenient & as described. It was a wonderful setting and very economical as well."
24240,44897976,2015-08-30,31232887,Melinda,"Absolutely incredible experience staying on the Slipper! We reserved the boat for the last weekend in August for our annual girls weekend (4 ladies), and it was perfection! Very clean, plenty of room, awesome deck to enjoy apps and wine under the sun and the moonlight, and incredible location! In the HEART of the north end on the waterfront. You cannot buy this location. We walked all over Boston (north end, Newburyport St, the Boston Common, Faneuil Hall, and walked to dinner on Hanover St). Susan (the boat manager), was so welcoming and accommodating and showed us a local market to grab anything we needed (food, wine, etc), and also picked up breakfast for us to have on the boat. Amazing overall experience, would (and will) reserve it again in a heartbeat. Boat living is THE way to live in the north end. Can't wipe the smiles off our faces from our time on this boat, and couldn't stop talking about how we would be cooped up in a hotel room otherwise....and instead here we were, on the water, on a beautiful boat, under the sun and stars. Perfect. And thank you!"
24240,47953399,2015-09-22,9993109,Sunanda,"Susan was really great about meeting us and helping us find the boat, as well as thoroughly explaining everything we needed to know about staying on it. It's a really unique experience to stay on a boat, and we loved the rocking of it, as well as the location. The decoration was amazing. Very 80's and interesting to look at."
We were left ample food for breakfast,and loved the nearby deli where we could buy ANYTHING that we needed.,,,,
"A good experience. Thank you!\"",,,,,
24240,48683950,2015-09-28,35469325,Jo,"\"This was the PERFECT place to stay in Boston! We had a wonderful time and absolutely loved the 'boat living\"\" experience.  I was a bit nervous at first because we were traveling with my parents and our 10 month old"

And The Golden Slipper is the best choice to stay in Boston. Best location,5 mins walk to Quincy Market and city tour bus station.,,,,
The ship is very clean,and Gretchen prepared a big breakfast for us,cake is very delicious.,,,
I will suggest my friends stay here who want to travel to Boston.,,,,,

24240,86826015,2016-07-17,22686725,Mark,My wife and I and another couple found this gem of a place last minute and figured it might be fun to stay on the water instead of on land.  It turned out to be a great experience.  Gretchen met us at the Golden Slipper to explain the nuances and we took it from there.  The location is great and the accommodations comfortable.  We'd definitely be back should we be in the Boston area again!
24240,89002585,2016-07-26,39542588,Jessica,The Golden Slipper was a fun and unique place for six of us to stay. The location was great with it being within walking distance of the North End. Our favorite part was waking up in the morning and relaxing on the deck. I am prone to motion sickness but didn't have any trouble on the boat as the water was very calm and taking bonine just to be safe worked. Gretchen was very helpful with accommodating an early check-in time and walking us through all of the nuances of the boat. Thanks Gretchen!
24240,91468839,2016-08-05,82485114,Dustin,Gretchen was hands down the defentition of the perfect hostess. When we arrived at her boat she was on deck waiting to meet and greet us. She took us on a tour of the boat and explained how everything worked and where everything was. She then took us on deck and pointed out where interesting sites were in the area and good places to get a meal. Her boat is located in the best part of the city for dining and site seeing. Could not recommend this location more to people traveling to Boston and want to stay on the water.
24240,94700040,2016-08-16,21140036,Daniel,"We had a great stay on Gretchen’s boat. We are a family of four with two daughters, ages 7 and 11, and we spent four nights on board. The location is super, especially for kids that age—right next to the aquarium, boats offering harbor tours, the Children’s Museum, Faneuil Hall, and the North End. The photos accurately reflect the size and condition of the boat. Gretchen was very welcoming and was flexible about our arrival time, which I deeply appreciate. I think four adults with suitcases would find the space a little tight, but if two of your four are children under the age of 12, I think it’s fine. The only other caveat is that the air conditioning and ventilation were not sufficient to defeat the stifling heat of the one night when temperatures were over 85 F / 30 C, but if it’s cooler than that—which it usually was—then everything was fine. The harbor is tranquil, the windows have insect screens on them, so there’s no reason not to sleep with the windows open. It was also very relaxing to sit on deck eating fruit or having a drink. We had fun – you should give it a try. Definitely made our stay in Boston more memorable."
12441,43526,2010-05-17,119070,Noreen,Miss Franklin is prompt and professional. The apartment was everything that it claimed to be. Comfortable and clean.
"Thank you.\"",,,,,
12441,267304,2011-05-17,369406,Marie,"Location was fantastic and the view at night was great for adding colour to entertaining. Small issues detracted from the overall decor. The leather lounge suite was very worn. The bedrooms were disappointing because the curtains were inadequate and some walls and windows needed repair. Being a penthouse and for the price, these items should have been fixed."
12441,482895,2011-08-29,359600,Wendy,"We had a wonderful time in Boston, even with the intrusion of Irene!!! This rental exceeded all that I was hoping for, which is a rare event.  The descriptions of this wonderful place are right on with the exception of two minor things.  We only found 2 bathrooms vs. 3 and there are a few more stairs then we expected.  Building elevator stops 1 flight before entrance.  A little challenging for elderly people but well worth the climb! We loved the place, the view and the location and look forward to returning again & again!  Thank you!!!"
12441,1271183,2012-05-13,295310,Anna,"Very nice penthouse with kitchen and dining area with a wonderful view, the only disappointmet was that 1 of 3 bedrooms was really small."
12441,1533767,2012-06-22,1900282,Cameron,"Great apartment, great location, great views!"
12441,2367449,2012-09-22,1822460,Tony,"The area is excellent, however, the accommodations are not worth the price that is charged.  TVs do not work, the cooking utensils are limited and do not fit the stove.  The showers are very cramped.  The sink did not drain because the drain plug was stuck.  The lights flickered at times.  The rooms were tiny.  Sleeping eight is a stretch."
12441,2534935,2012-10-08,1978920,Marc,"The penthouse apt. was very nice. However, the elevator wasn't working, and we had to climb 6 flights (4 times, as it ended up). That can happen. However there were other problems that a checklist would have corrected. The cooling did not work until an air conditioning contractor was called (the apt was in the 80s when we arrived after climbing stairs). First, the thermostat in the LR didn't control the cooling, though the sign on it warned against setting it too low. We later were told the cooling was controlled by a thermostat behind the front door, in a closet or niche, but it was inoperable because the battery needed replacement. There was no bath or hand soap, an omission we did not discover until we were ready to shower -- then an 8 block walk to buy soap. The coffeemaker is broken (line that distributes hot water to the grounds was missing); the filters provided were the wrong type (we poured boiling water manually); the toaster oven on/off knob was missing; remote controls on bedroom TVs didn't work (discovered 2 could be turned on at the device on last morning); the front lights in sw bedroom didn't work (had to climb riser to turn on the rear set); the shower head in upstairs hall bathroom aimed at the wall (bracket was broken), so couldn't be used.  I always leave a tip for housekeepers -- they have the worst job -- but didn't this time because a basic review would have solved most of these problems. If they had turned the AC on before our arrival on a hot day, they would have known it didnt work.  A great apartment made very unpleasant by neglect of little things."
12441,6454046,2013-08-13,5622940,Paige,The apartment had a couple of issues. The TV was not hooked up in one of the bedrooms. The master bath has a stained glass window behind the toilet overlooking the bedroom.  A less than private experience.
12441,8346664,2013-10-27,8287847,Suyash,Great location and apartment. We had no problems at the place.
12441,9928628,2014-01-20,9802151,David,The unit itself was nice. Great views. Cleaning could have been better- IE used shampoos and toiletries in the bathrooms.
Kitty was great however. We had an issue and were unable to use the whole reservation. She tried her best to help,"but unfortunately change and cancelation policies are strict. Nonetheless she was great to work with and very easy to reach by phone. \"",,,,

Only critisism: the kitchen is badly equipped and the rooms are a lot smaller than they appear in the pictures. Nevertheless, this apartment is totally worth it!"
12441,15870552,2014-07-17,16224029,Gianna,Did not see or speak to anyone the whole stay! The location of this apartment was great walking distance to most attractions. The apartment itself needs some TLC.  The pantry was totally empty we thought at least the bare essentials such as tea coffee sugar salt pepper should have been provided. The lift only takes you to the 6th floor then you have to walk up 2 flights of stairs which could not have been more narrow. All ok but there were 4 of us with a fair bit of luggage a very difficult and awkward thing to do. The air conditioner was not user friendly the info left really not helpful.
12441,18708702,2014-08-31,12190924,Pedro,My friends and I had a great stay over the weekend.  Perfect location just off the commons.  Great accommodations.  The place was very clean.  The only issue we had was the furniture downstairs needs some tending to.  Wobbly chairs and old leather couch that was flaking off.
The apartment was quiet,private,"had a great view of Boston areas and the AC was perfectly cold.   Highly recommended for a nice get away with family and friends.  \"",,,
12441,23641202,2014-12-07,23542385,Emily,"The neighborhood, Back Bay, was absolutely beautiful, safe, and the ideal location for our group. The penthouse welcomed us with amazing views, just as the pictures show, and very clean living quarters. The bathrooms were a bit small (except master). The only toiletries available were deodorant bars, so be sure to bring your own. The apartment was stocked with extra sheets, blankets, and towels, which was very nice. The kitchen had a good supply of kitchenware, dishes, and utensils, but the refrigerator was completely empty. We encountered a structural incident where a very small window pane popped out from its frame when trying to open the window.  We contacted Kitty and property management immediately and they were both very helpful and concerned for our needs. The window did not affect our stay and we thoroughly enjoyed every minute in this lovely home. If we ever came back we would definitely consider staying here again! We thank you for allowing us into your home!"
12441,28405695,2015-03-23,26709215,Thomas,Terrific location in a terrific funky old building. Bedrooms are large enough and the kitchen living area is terrific for downtime. The old elevator is something out of a movie and fun in itself. We would definitely re-book the place. Showers and baths were clean with plenty of hot water for 6 of us.
12441,47389602,2015-09-18,44222110,Joyce,The host canceled this reservation 250 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

12441,61627191,2016-02-07,2854467,Lorena,"We a group of 6 stayed at the penthouse of the Beacon st location for 3 days. We arrived around 11:00am and were able to store our luggage at the management office. Everyone there was very welcoming and professional. It was snowing pretty hard and the staff was so nice they offered us umbrellas. We spent a fee hours at the mall right by the management office. We then picked up our bags and again the staff was extremely helpful by calling us taxi cabs. The rental property its in a excellent location. The Cheer bar is about half a block away. We rented the penthouse which is on the 7th floor. There is only one tiny 1 person elevator so we have to walk up the stairs. I didn't mind the stairs but I have to say It was a struggle and I consider myself fit. They are very narrow and in sort of a spiral (got dizzy a few times). The penthouse first floor is really nice. It has a BEAUTIFUL view. Living room is great, kitchen tiny but functional. There is a tiny bathroom by the entrance. There are three bedrooms upstairs. One bedroom its huge with an on-suite bathroom. The second bedroom is medium size but cozy. The third bedroom is quite small but very cozy. There is a bathroom in the hall. Now, everything went well for the most part. Location great, design interesting. Lovely place. Nonetheless, there were a couple of hicups; the sofa had not been cleaned. It was full of ton of white animal hair. Tons! Same with the pillows. We tried vacuuming the sofa but the vacuum in the closet did not have a bag. A person in our group is allergic to cats/dogs so his allergies kicked in right away to the point he considered going to a hotel. We called the office and they were very helpful and sent someone to vacuum the sofa. We also mentioned to the office that the closet door in the upstairs bedroom was unhinged and broken. Same with one of the glass doors in the upstairs bedroom and downstairs closet. Just an observation, There were a few blinds missing on the medium and small bedrooms and since bed is right under them due to slanted ceiling the sun hit you right in the face very early in the morning. We were fine with that but wanted to mention it. The medium and small rooms were warm but the big room.... It was FREEZING at night. It seems like the thermostat in the room is either broken or its there just for decor because it was blowing cold air. There were two very small electrical heating units in the closet which we tried to used but did not work at all. So our first night there was quite cold. We called the office the next day and thankfully they brought up a space heater which we used and made the whole difference in the..."

12441,80328276,2016-06-17,8524510,J Scott,"The apartment was in a great neighborhood.  The building and the apartment were nice and clean.  It is an old building and has lots of stairs.  Several to the entry of the building.  Once in the building, there is a small elevator to the 6th floor.  The penthouse is on the 7th and the stairway to the penthouse is narrow.  Once in the penthouse, there are additional stairs to the bedrooms.  We were were four adults with lots of luggage, so it was a challenge. Otherwise, it was a great experience.   With so much to do in the area, we were barely in the apartment."
12441,85514845,2016-07-11,51692756,Ronny,"Ideal location to see all of Boston. Steps from Boston Common, Cheers, and the start of the freedom Trail. Views of the city from both levels of this apartment are stunning."

The house is fantastic and in the perfect location in Boston's second oldest suburb. Walking distance to most of the major sights and great transport connections to places beyond walking distance.,,,,,
The room itself is big and the bed is extremely comfy and wifi is great. The original staircase is a lovely period feature. Breakfast pastries and coffee every morning is an added bonus.,,,,,

4303606,22671507,2014-11-11,23004578,Lucy,"Had a fantastic 4 night stay with Gustavo, who is such an accommodating and thoughtful host.  He let me leave my luggage there on the morning of my arrival and gave me the key so I could check in later.  His room is large and spacious, the bed and linen very comfortable, everything is so clean, smells fresh and the location is brilliant!  He is flexible with the timing of the breakfast, and would leave a bag so you can take-away the pastries!  The best thing is that he always replied promptly to my questions and wifi is included too. I would highly recommend a stay with Gustavo."
4303606,22992802,2014-11-19,23430506,C,"Gustavo is a wonderful host and the apartment is very comfortable, clean and safe.  Breakfast in the morning is an added benefit and Gustavo goes out of his way to do this for you, even early in the morning.  The location is close to the convention center and the block is very quaint, it makes you feel like you really live in Boston!"

4303606,27963904,2015-03-15,28718196,Rebecca,Gustavo's home was charming and right in the heart of boston as advertised. We first met him at breakfast he was very welcoming and was full of very helpful information.  He was very easy to get in touch with if needed and I look forward to staying again.
4303606,28185046,2015-03-19,25184126,Claudia,"Gustavo ist ein toller Gastgeber. Sehr kommunikativ und hilfreich. Das Haus ist alt, aber sehr charmant. Der Standort ist perfekt um Boston zu erkunden. Absolut perfekt für einen Kurztrip, können es nur empfehlen."
4303606,28475888,2015-03-24,2799425,Jorge,"I stayed at Gustavo's townhouse for 4 days and it was a great experience. The room was clean, ample, and had all the amenities one would expect in a hotel. The breakfast was satisfying and varied. The location is ideal to walk around Boston. Overall, it would be a pleasure to come back."
4303606,28669484,2015-03-28,20554211,Christof,"Gustavo was a really great host. We had a cozy room with our own bathroom. Everything was clean and tidy. His house is really charming, located in an historic part of Boston close to the city center. The breakfast was great and Gustavo gave us recommendations for good restaurants nearby. Overall a five star stay: recommended!"
4303606,30375596,2015-04-21,24917475,Vincee,"Everything about our stay was fantastic. Gustavo stayed in touch with us before, during and after our stay. We were in town for the marathon and the location where we stayed couldn't have been better for the price. I was able to have full use of the kitchen to keep food that was important for the marathon and my husband enjoyed the spread Gustavo made every morning. Would definitely recommend this charming b&b."
4303606,31219031,2015-05-03,30874760,Michelle,"For our first Air B&B experience, we were quite pleased. Gustavo was a great host. This is a nice house with old charm, what I would call a classic B&B for what we look for. The location is perfect within walking distance to many attractions, we didn't need to use our car and found easy access to all with walking, taxi, or the T. The area is safe to stay, great overall choice. Gustavo responded promptly to anything needed and is a great host."
4303606,31672260,2015-05-08,23470866,Matthew,"All good, clean, comfortable and nice walking access to Boston.  Bedroom is accessed from landing, dedicated bath is also a door on same landing, so a quick step from bedroom to bath.  Luxurious bathrobes and nice continental breakfast both a surprise."

Our host was attentive and accommodating given our special circumstances. The set up is great, and breakfast was perfect! We will be back!"
4303606,33504115,2015-05-29,27439212,Ashlee,"I was in Boston for a work conference and stayed at Gustavo's because the hotel my colleagues were staying at was sold out. The location was perfect! And I loved staying in a unique true Boston historic gem. Right in the heart of all the places I needed to be. Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay. I only wish that the bathroom would have been connected to the bathroom. I don't think it would have matter to me if I had been staying with my husband on vacation."
4303606,34572208,2015-06-09,32197925,David,This was a  great (and my first)  experience with accommodation arranged via Airbnb ..
The location is perfect -  a very quiet part of downtown Boston,an old house with quite a historic-Boston-atmosphere (a bit like Beacon Hill) and it is close to everywhere.    Everything went perfect with Gustavo - our arrival,getting extra set o keys for my mother,extra bed,info about whereabouts,we even could use the kitchen upstairs ..
Thanks a lot!  David and Jarmila,Prague,,,,

4303606,36060381,2015-06-24,25678745,Stanley,Great first airbnb experience!  Very convenient location.  Close to everything.  Bed and pillows were very comfortable.  Overall excellent stay.  Thank you Gustavo for being a great host.
4303606,38328952,2015-07-14,16964776,Kate,"The room was actually better than the listing, if that's to be believed. Very comfortable bed, spacious room, with a full closet, desk, and stuffed chair. It's a very quick walk from the Boston Commons and a plethora of T lines. I was in town for a conference at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center and it was a pleasant 30 minute walk from the apartment to BCEC, through Chinatown and out. I also ran several times while in Boston and the Esplanade is imminently accessible from this Bay Village brownstone."
The location is ideal,the area is surprisingly quiet at night,and Gustavo a very welcoming and accommodating host. He was very responsive via text message for any concerns,requests,or unexpected delays in arrivals - especially fabulous when you are out and about most of the day.,
"Would definitely stay again.\"",,,,,
4303606,40396804,2015-07-30,39370011,Josh,"It couldn't have been better.  When I arrived, Gustavo greeted me and took me through a tour of the room, private bathroom, and kitchen area.  The room was just as pictured.  It was a hot week, and the room had a window air-conditioner which kept the room at the perfect temperature at night."
The Bathroom was clean and private.  The kitchen area was nice.  Rather than indulge in the free continental breakfast,I got my own eggs and sausage that I was able to keep in the fridge for morning meals. I stayed for 4 days,so it was nice to have the capability to cook a full breakfast each day (you can't do that easily at a hotel).,,,
The location is convenient.  This is a great place to stay.,,,,,

I arrived in the morning before the check-in time but Gustavo very quickly accommodated for me to drop off my bags. He was very welcoming and gave suggestions on the best restaurants around the area and generally various locations in Boston. The apartment is in the central but quiet location within a walking distance to many touristy places. Overall it was a great experience staying over there! Would definitely recommend it to anyone.

4303606,46497374,2015-09-11,40601455,John,"Gustavo was very welcoming. I was one hour later than expected, but that proved no issue with Gustavo. He lives on the ground floor. It did happen to be a very warm and humid period and the entire house was very warm. The room is on the third floor of a very tight stairwell so know that going up and down takes care. My room was very warm. The air conditioner had not been on and the windows were closed, so the room was hot. Gustavo turned the air conditioner on and it was very weak. He did offer to go out and purchase a new one the next day but I told him that I would just open the windows. That night was very warm. Their is no airflow in the room and ceiling fan or regular portable fan would have helped a ton. When the outside temperature went down the following day, the open windows were fine and all was better."
The room is rather spartan. No TV,no radio,but Wifi worked and was adequate. The bathroom was in the hallway,just out the door,and I was told that it was just for me to use,but still would rather have a bathroom in my room. The bathroom is very small
The general common area is on the 4th floor,and that was too warm to consider. I did use ice cubes from the freezer. Again,there is little airflow in the house,and it really impacts the top floor lounge and kitchen areas.,,
My biggest issue here is the cost. I just do not see the value here. The location is great,and compared to hotels in the area,this is less expensive,but I would rather spend more for better AC,in room bathroom,"and better amenities throughout. \""

Yet it is tucked in a really quaint, quiet, quintessential Bostonian tree-lined street. I will definitely be back."

II is large, airy, with nice picturesque furniture and paintings and windows that look out onto a scenic street.  Nice comfortable bed and beautiful old wood plank floors.  The room comes with a private bathroom, but you need to go out of the room (right next door) to access it.  Lots of hot water and very clean.  Gustavo was a nice, thoughtful host.  His email, communications were timely and helpful, and in person, he was friendly and made sure everything was in order.  The free continental breakfast was nice, really appreciated being able to have coffee and a croissant before venturing out.  The upstairs breakfast nook is also very charming, with treetop views of nearby rooftop balconies and a bit of the Boston skyline.  Really nice, memorable stay.  It made me feel like I was a Bostoniian!"

There's a bed, desk, chair, and an armoire and dresser for clothes. Right outside the room is the bathroom. Although there were other guests staying during my time I never saw them--it was very private and quiet. Besides the comfortable room, the location of this AirBnb is UNBEATABLE! You are walking distance to public transportation, and walking distance (15-20 minutes) to get to the heart of Back Bay or downtown Boston. Just a few minutes walk from the Boston Public Garden. I would highly recommend staying with Gustavo!"

Definitly cleaner then most hotels that I stay at.  The beds were very comfortable.  The apartment has a great view of Boston, and is in perfect walking distance to the Andrew station - which has some great spots along the route for bars."

Mac's apartment was by far the best accommodation we came to experience during our road trip. The apartment is coveniently located in South Boston. It was very clean and all of us felt highly comfortable staying there. Mac also provided us with a wide range of useful links for our stay in Boston. We would like to thank Mac for being a great host and are hoping that we can come back in the near future."
9013631,92350768,2016-08-08,83284258,Michelle,"Our host was so responsive from the very beginning. He answered all of my questions and was so accommodating! He made it easy to get a hold of him as well if I needed him. The location is amazing! Yes, it is on busy road, but parking was easy to find and it was about a $7 Uber to any part of the city! The apartment itself was clean, well decorated, and lots of space to accommodate people! The beds were so comfortable as well making a great nights sleep! This apartment had everything that we needed! All in all it was great trip and I would definitely recommend staying here to everyone!"

Very responsive before we arrived and had a great set of instructions for the apartment, even had a little arrival gift for us which was unexpected and super sweet. The neighbourhood was great too, lots of great restaurants/bars, access to city shared bikes to get downtown was quick too. Apartment was clean, bed was comfortable. Can't say enough good things. Would definitely visit again!"
5593888,32081548,2015-05-13,709811,Jochen,"Wir haben 4 Tage  in Boston verbracht. Bei der Schlüsselübergabe erwiesen sich Christina und Drew als sehr flexibel und kooperativ , obwohl sie eigentlich zu unserer Ankunftszeit gar nicht da waren. Die Wohnung ist hübsch, man kann das Wohnzimmer mitbenutzen. Das Gästezimmer ist klein, aber ausreichend, das Doppelbett sehr bequem. Die Massachusetts Avenue ist relativ laut, man gewöhnt sich aber daran. Back Bay und die schönen Straßen des South End sind zu Fuß gut zu erreichen. 2 Querstraßen weiter, in der Columbus Avenue gibt es Leihfahrräder, mit denen man (dank der allgegenwärtigen Kreditkarte) immer für eine halbe Stunde fein Boston erkunden kann."
Am letzten Abend haben wir Christina und Drew dann noch kennengelernt: Sie sind ausgesprochen nett,unkompliziert,"gastfreundlich und interessiert - absolut vertrauenswürdige Leute.\"",,,
5593888,32565861,2015-05-19,31728493,Joëlle,"3 très bonnes journées passées chez Drew et Christina - ils nous ont accueillies merveilleusement bien et nous avons même dine tous ensemble le dernier soir ! Une belle rencontre ... La chambre est assez petite mais très agréable  , elle donne sur le salon ce qui est très pratique . Le lit est très confortable et on dort bien. Nos hôtes nous ont chouchoutés , conseilles ... Une belle expérience -"

5593888,34868620,2015-06-13,30356463,Wayne,"The hosts, Christina and Drew, were very hospitable and helpful. The location is a short walk from the Silver Line 4/5 bus to the city There are several good eateries down Washington Avenue, which is just around the corner. The accommodation is comfortable and there is air-conditioning to keep it cool."
5593888,35146178,2015-06-15,33904761,Ashley,Drew and Christina was very easy and accommodating to communicate with prior to the arrive.  They welcomed us upon arrival and gave us a tour of the room/ apt.  Great location in downtown Boston and was easy to get place to place. Drew made us aware of easy and free street parking right next to the apt.  For our quick one night stay this was the perfect place and location.
5593888,36099535,2015-06-25,32213640,Peter,"Very uncomplicated stay. They even asked if they shall pick me up from the airport when i was arriving late. One thing though - window is located to the street, therefor pretty noisy."
5593888,36566725,2015-06-29,34303342,Pooja,"Drew and Christina were great hosts! They made us feel very welcome and were so helpful throughout our trip, always making sure they were reachable in case we needed anything. The room is very comfortable and the apartment is clean and quiet. It's centrally located, safe, and there are a lot of great places nearby. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! :)"
5593888,37353852,2015-07-06,35427786,John,Drew and Christina were awesome!  My wife and I stayed here for 5 days over the 4th of July and absolutely loved it. Drew even let us tag along to a rooftop party with his friends to watch the fireworks. They're really awesome hosts and the house is in a great location. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
5593888,39201389,2015-07-21,36901002,Chelsey,"Drew and Christina were wonderful hosts! They have a cute little apartment that was close and convenient to everything.  We were accommodated with more than enough, including a list with restaurant suggestions and transportation tips.  They were incredibly welcoming and treated us like friends. Thank you!"
5593888,39404968,2015-07-23,36080019,Dan,Our experience at Drew and Christine's place was perfect for our time in Boston. The location was ideal for our busy sightseeing schedule and we enjoyed how close everything was either by foot or the T. Drew and Christina are both extremely hospitable and made sure that we felt welcome right away. Thanks again for the awesome time in Boston!
5593888,39783198,2015-07-26,35817238,Paige,The hosts were welcoming and allowed us to use any and all facilities in the apartment. Christina had some subway passes that she gave me to get around the city. The apartment itself was dingy despite the attempt to use bright colors on the walls. Everything had a layer of grime. The door handles were loose and the sink in the bathroom didn't drain. The whole complex inside reeked of weed the entire time I stayed. Bring earplugs because the room faces the main street and ambulances and cop cars pass all night long. There is really no consideration for guests. I would not stay here again.

They gave us a sheet of recommendations in the city, how to get around, and gave us earplugs to block sound from the street."
