5593888,40614644,2015-08-01,36589598,Dan,"Drew and Christina were perfect hosts. They provided us with very useful information about local transport, places to eat and drink etc. The room and the apartment were clean and tidy and we had full use of their facilities. We definitely recommend them."
5593888,43624054,2015-08-21,5796796,Barbara,"I had a great stay with Drew and Christina. They are both wonderful people, very helpful and it was nice to have a chat with them. They recommended lots of great places ( just to name flour bakery) and were very accommodating. The place is very comfy, clean, with everything you need and nicely situated in the south end with good connections to downtown and Cambridge. I highly recommend it!"
5593888,44465586,2015-08-26,40618068,Marie,"Amazing place ! Well located and lovely hosts : Drew and Christina had let us a note where they indicate the best restaurants, the bus stops, the Hubway station (free bikes), etc."
They both are very nice,"even if we didn't see them a lot. Special thanks to Drew for your lesson : How to tip properly !\"",,,,
5593888,45375562,2015-09-02,35723956,Benjamin,"We had a great time with Drew and Christina. They were very nice hosts. They were very accommodating and helpful. They gave a lot of informations about the south end. They also gave us a sheet of recommendations in the city, how to get around, and gave us earplugs to block sound from the street. The room was nice and clean as in the pictures!"
"We strongly recommend them!\"",,,,,
5593888,46516517,2015-09-11,41762544,Leslie,We had a very short stay in Boston at Drew and Christina's place as our flight was cancelled last minute. They were both easy to get in touch with and understanding about this sudden change. Our time there was great. This is a great location and we loved that we could walk everywhere. Everything was as described and they were both very nice. We got some great recommendations for places to eat and visited what we could in our short time!
"\"",,,,,
5593888,46935194,2015-09-14,42036365,Emily,The listing was accurate. Room was a little small but bed was comfortable. Neighborhood was quaint with typical Boston brownstone apartments & parks nearby.
5593888,47282551,2015-09-17,39116627,Lia,"Both Christina and Drew were there to welcome me at the apartment.  They gave me a few great tips about where to eat locally and how to get around Boston.  The room faces onto the main road and is therefore quite noisy but I was given ear plugs and slept very well.  The room itself is small but as I was only there to sleep, I really didn't mind. The apartment was clean and tidy.  Also an additional thoughtful touch - Drew also wrote out a list of places to eat in Portland, Maine, which was my next destination, which is was really lovely and useful."
5593888,48100256,2015-09-23,42407905,Marcel,"We had a great time at the apartment of Drew and Christina. We stayed 3 nights so the room was a bit small but there is a closet, providing some extra space. The room faces the busy Massachusetts Avenue, however we didn't think it was too noisy. The apartment itself is clean and tidy. Both Christina and Drew are very nice and left us helpful recommendations were to go to. Also they were very flexible about our arriving time."
5593888,49897449,2015-10-07,5358313,Zhaohua,"位置非常方便,房间虽不大但简洁干净,Drew & Christina是两个很热心的室友,尽心回答你的所有问题"
5593888,50296007,2015-10-11,13272650,Thierry,"My girlfriend and I stayed here four nights. First of all the location is perfect, most sightseeing sites were on fine walking distance from the appartment. Unfortunately the appartement is located at the side of the Mass. Ave, so please don't forget to bring your ear plugs! Additionally, mind that for a longer stay the room can be quite small. Further Drew and Christina, were good hosts and easy to communicate with."
5593888,51714065,2015-10-24,28639647,Emily,"Amazing! The hosts were super friendly and helpful, the room comfortable and tidy, and the area lovely and easy to walk or get public transport anywhere. Highly recommend!!"
5593888,53109091,2015-11-05,13833247,Raúl,"Drew and Cristina were very nice to us, we had clean towels, clean bedroom. The apartment is not so noisy as others said the street is noisy, it depends on how good are u with the sound we barely felt it. The bedroom was super clean and for us it was a key. Thanks guys for everything"
5593888,53503875,2015-11-09,10228668,Thomas,"Drew & Christina are wonderful hosts. They provided me with loads of tips where to go and what to see. Even the room is quite small and the road in front is noisy, I´d recommend to stay with them."
5593888,54185721,2015-11-16,35592424,Emiley,"It was great that Drew was able to greet us upon arrival and check out. While interaction was brief, it was very friendly and welcoming. Drew also provided great recommendations on food and how to get around the city, and we were smart to listen to his suggestions! The room itself is comfy and clean, and overall perfect for a short stay in Boston. Unlike some others, we did not even notice the busy street at night time."
5593888,59120933,2016-01-07,22517371,Samantha,"Drew and Christina were great hosts, warm, welcoming, and laid back while respecting our privacy and ensuring we had everything we need. The apartment is in a wonderful location, easy to travel within and outside Boston from. It was a pleasure staying with them, thanks guys for having us! (:"
5593888,62568817,2016-02-15,35150406,Alia,"Drew and Christina were so friendly and accommodating during our stay. The room was clean and comfortable, with thoughtful little touches included such as soap, toothbrushes, maps to the city, a welcome note, and even a little barbecue seasoning souvenir! Even though the common area was shared, neither was around very often which made the space feel more private. When they were around, they hung out and chatted with us and were very warm. The location was great too, easy to get around from and identifiable to cab drivers. Overall, a very fun and pleasant stay!"
5593888,63818327,2016-02-27,56060789,Mary,"Great location, with easy access to public transportation. The bed was also very comfortable."
5593888,65040252,2016-03-10,35727978,Agnès,Drew and Christina appartement is really nice.
The description of the place is correct and the bed is really confortable.,,,,,
The neighborhood is nice,with a few restaurants. In 10 min you are in the orange line of the subway (the T).,,,,
Drew and Christina are welcoming and kind.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5593888,65612520,2016-03-15,59723533,Danny,"\"Drew and Christina were both very welcoming - they greeted me at the door and made sure that I was all set for my stay (e.g., giving me my key, orienting me to the house).  Drew and Christina made my friend and I feel as though we had known them for quite some time - I found myself watching \"\"Top Chef\"\" with Drew and joking around with Christina"
5593888,66724639,2016-03-24,59114382,Fung Ying,"Drew and Christina were both really nice and very friendly. We felt very welcomed in this foreign environment. Also, they both worked at a nearby restaurant that serves very delicious food, so do ask them for recommendations if you're seeking some great noms!"
BUT,we were disappointed with several things during our stay. Firstly,the room is very small,albeit the pictures are accurate,we were not expecting such a tiny space. But,all good
So really,it was quite a lovely place to stay in an excellent location. But it depends on what your standards are. The AirBnBs we have both stayed in before were all very amazingly clean,etc. So it may have raised our standards a ton and caused us to expect more than we were given. It wasn't a bad place to stay at all,just disappointing. That said,"we absolutely loved Drew and Christina as people... Just not their cleaning habits.\"",
5593888,68463494,2016-04-05,14742473,Tracy,"Drew and Christina were lovely. Christina was there to greet us and gave us lots of helpful recommendations for places to eat - definitely check out Flour bakery! The apartment was nice and cozy, with towels (and toothbrush and earplugs) all provided! The bedroom does face the main road but that wasn't an issue for us. The location was also great - I  just hopped onto the silver line down the road and can get into town."
5593888,69293209,2016-04-10,3085752,Sheila,"Drew was very nice, responsive, and easy to talk to. Our room had a print out of the general rules of our stay, and he also printed out instructions and directions to get to some parts of the city. South End was an awesome neighborhood to go home to every day. It's very close to Flour Bakery, which I highly recommend! The mattress was also super comfortable for us, and although there was some noise outside the window, it didn't bother us at all, since we're used to it in New York. Overall, great stay, and I would definitely recommend it if you want a place that is simple, inexpensive, and easy to get to different areas around Boston."
5593888,70645883,2016-04-19,52233355,Matthew,Drew & Christina were incredibly accommodating hosts who exceeded both me and my girlfriend's expectations during Marathon weekend.  Christina was readily available the day we checked-in and both made us feel right at home the three days we spent there.  Drew even allowed us to hold our bags a couple hours past our check out time so my girlfriend and I could check out some museums with our flight being later in the evening.
Their apartment location is a couple minutes walk from public transit and any services you might need,and the neighborhood was alive and buzzing throughout our entire stay.  Great hosts,"great location and great people!\"",,,
5593888,71344882,2016-04-24,15741464,Timothy,"I had a perfectly enjoyable stay here. The hosts were friendly and welcoming, and provided everything listed. A great choice for those looking for an easy no-hassle place to stay."
5593888,72013721,2016-04-30,535680,Sofia,"Drew is a wonderful host!! The guy is trully a smiling machine full with good vibes and great tips for those who are looking to get around the city. My boyfriend and I stayed there and Drew has two separate key sets for us, a brief guide about what is around the area and how to get around. He even lend us his own baseball caps to use at the Yankee vs. Red Sox game!"
The apartment is not luxurious,but has everything you need  including a very comfy bed and fresh towels! The bathroom might not be ideal from the looks (bathtub is stained,paint job was half-done,and floors are broken - but Drew is fixing!). However,it is CLEAN. That is a big deal for me. I did not get to use his kitchen or living space,but it looked nice and tidy.
Please contact Drew if you have questions. He is truly sweet and his girlfriend was also very personable when we met!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5593888,73092034,2016-05-06,56942512,Christopher,"We came from Australia to visit Boston and Drew & Christina were very kind and inviting right from the beginning. They were extremely knowledgeable about local area and great places to eat, visit, etc. The apartment itself was just what we needed. Simple with access to wifi, TV, etc and great location. We loved Boston and would definitely recommend staying here. Thanks again guys!"
5593888,74036947,2016-05-12,1131738,Patrick,"Drew and Christina were *wonderful* hosts, checking in and out went smoothly, and the neighborhood was perfect for walking around and finding interesting restaurants/bars/shops."
Otherwise the front door lock was difficult to access,the street noise was always apparent,and the room itself was cramped and got rather swampy in the middle of the night. All in all I wouldn't seek out this spot when back in Boston,"but it was certainly fine for one night and we were happy to have met Drew and Christina!\"",,
5593888,74182319,2016-05-13,4474191,Sarah,"Christina and Drew were very nice hosts, giving us tips about the neighborhood and what to see in Boston. They made sure we had everything we needed."
5593888,74810421,2016-05-16,12643821,Thomas,"I had a very good experience.  Drew was great, he contacted me in advance to coordinate my check-in, which worked out as planned.  He made me very comfortable about using the kitchen and living area.  There were many small touches that I really appreciated like having Keurig K-cups so I could have coffee each morning (I was there 3 nights), towels, bath wash, even moisturizer, and pamphlets about things to do in Boston.  Since no one was checking in the day I was checking out, he said I could checkout as late as I wanted."
I met Christina later and she was equally friendly.  Neither of them was around very much (of course neither was I),but when I was around I felt like I had the place to myself.  They offered good recommendations for local places - Washington St was best.,,,,
"I was very pleased with the access to public transportation.  Buses are right there at Mass Ave and Washington St. going everywhere.  The T is \"\"only\"\" 3 blocks but note that it is 3 city blocks so more than a 5 minute walk",which was fine by me.  I walked all the way to the theater district and lots of shopping in about 30 minutes or so.,,,,
I would note that similar to many real estate photos,the pictures make the place look a lot newer than it actually is.  Typical of a large east cost city,the building is pretty old,but their apartment was clean.,,
The only other thing I would mention as some other reviews say is that the room is on the street side and Mass Ave is a busy street late into the night and early in the morning.  But they had ear plugs for us too!,,,,,
For the price,convenient location,and excellent hosts,"I recommend it.  \"",,
5593888,75666169,2016-05-22,40138894,Jacqueline,Very cool neighborhood. Definitely use the ear plugs Drew and Christina provide - lifesavers!
5593888,76918070,2016-05-29,28027872,Tera,Drew and Christina were fantastic hosts for our visit to Boston! Mass Ave. is a little loud but they provide earplugs and do a great job of making your visit comfortable and they provide excellent recommendations for places in the city!
The location in the South End is perfect,they're just a block down from the S4 stop which is super easy to connect to from the free airport shuttle. Easy to get to other lines and really walkable.,,,,
"Definitely recommend if you'll be visiting Boston!\"",,,,,
5593888,78423748,2016-06-06,26398180,Matteo,"Christina and Drew are very nice and welcoming people. The house is a nice neighborhood very close to different transport options. The house is very nice and quite clean but very very old and the room very small as you can see from the pictures. Therefore not very comfortable. Overall is a good solution for a weekend in Boston, probably not for longer times."
5593888,78583941,2016-06-07,27643937,Charlotte,We loved Boston and had a lovely stay here! Thanks for being such great hosts!
5593888,79385170,2016-06-12,1097320,Steven,"We had a great stay with Drew & Christina.  They are very nice and we got along great.  Christina made arrangements to greet us on arrival and gave us a bunch of quality restaurant and bar recommendations in the area.  The neighborhood is nice, convenient to transportation and within walking distance of some great entertainment.  Comfortable bed as well."
5593888,79623162,2016-06-13,8244615,Katherine,Drew and Christina were so helpful and kind throughout the booking process and our brief stay. Their apartment is lovely and we really enjoyed our stay!
5593888,80014956,2016-06-15,24442293,Rachel,"Drew and Christina are awesome hosts! They're friendly, helpful and accessible. The house is quirky, just the way it looks in the photos. Location is perfect for walking to the best of the south end."
5593888,80664030,2016-06-19,70345297,Derek,It was a great location. Easy to take the bus or subway to different parts of Boston. Very nice hosts and everything was clean. Drew was nice enough to accommodate our late night arrival and gave us tips on places to try. The street noise is loud but luckily the hum of the AC unit drowned most of it out.
5593888,82067958,2016-06-26,75931707,Jessica,"This was our first time using Airbnb and we were pleasantly surprised. Drew and Christina contacted us as we made our travels to Boston, checking in, and letting us know that they would be there to greet us. Indeed they were, Drew even met us outside to help us more easily locate his building. The place was just as they desribed. We were given keys to the outdoor entry way, to the apartment, and even keys to our private room (but being Texas girls, we just left our room unlocked and felt very comfortable doing so). Ontop of providing bedding and toiletries, something we really appreciated, was a fact/ fun sheet that they provided info about things to do and places to eat nearby, even coupon codes for uber and Lyft which was really helpful. That being said, we didn't use uber or Lyft much because the location was phenomenal and was in walking distance of virtually everything we needed. The neighborhood was great. We felt very safe walking around, even past midnight. We really enjoyed staying with Drew and Christina. We would definitely stay there again."
5593888,83301450,2016-07-02,16639359,Saarika,Drew and Christina were very accommodating of our travel times and needs. Directions for check-in were very smooth. The apartment and room were ideal for staying overnight and exploring all day in Boston. Drew was around the apartment in the morning and was helpful in giving recommendations around the area.
5593888,84060972,2016-07-05,37733218,Bridget,"Drew was a great host and the cozy little room we stayed in was perfect for what we needed. The A/C worked well and the bed was  very comfortable! The apartment itself had a lot of character and quirks and although it isn't super close to transportation, we enjoyed walking around the cute, clean neighborhood. We were only a 10 minute drive from anywhere we wanted to go!"
5593888,84898886,2016-07-09,57943214,Zeeshan,"Drew and Christina are a beautiful family and host. They were very flexible about my odd check-in timings and would respond to my texts promptly, giving me subway directions and telling me how to get to their place from the Airport. I had a conference to attend at Copley Marriott and the location for this place was excellent. The apartment is beautiful and has a vintage feel to it. The bed and AC were perfect and  the host had prepared everything from fresh towels to toothbrushes. Besides these, Drew and Christina were very nice to talk to and have a conversation with. I wish my schedule had allowed more time to get to know them better. I would highly recommend their place if you are in Boston."
5593888,86207092,2016-07-15,16578778,Celeste,"The hosts were easy to communicate with, and I had a smooth check in process. The neighborhood is walking distance to many restaurants, parks and shops."
5593888,87341599,2016-07-19,38300694,Lea,Drew and Christina were very welcoming and helpful in suggesting amazing places to eat and things to do. The place was as described. We had a great time- thanks Drew and Christina!
5593888,90835646,2016-08-02,54237691,Claire,"Drew is very friendly and gives a lot of Tips how to get around or where to eat. Every time we went trough the Building door it smelled like weed. But we have been warned, and we were ok with it. The appartment did not smell like weed. The room is very small and jet smaller if your are travelling with 3 suitcases. On the corner they had a lot of Flyers with Infos and welcome candies. The Bed was comfortable but the street noise is very loud. We had to choose between the street noise or the AC noise, both pretty loud but otherwise the room would have been too hot. For the noise they had left Earplugs in the room.  The location was good, we had a lots of near places to eat, we had a 7/11 across the street, there is a bus Station one Block away and a train Station 3 blocks away."
5593888,91778342,2016-08-06,57288744,Sake Jan,Prima plek om twee nachten te vertoeven. Het is er wel wat lawaaierig omdat het vlakbij een doorgaande verkeersader ligt en ook het ziekenhuis vlak in de buurt is. Er zijn oordoppen aanwezig die ik pas de tweede dag had ontdekt. Het is niet duur en je zit qua openbaar vervoer prima.
Het bed is prima en de airco zorgt voor een goede temperatuur,"ook bij 30 graden buiten. \"",,,,
5593888,93115384,2016-08-11,69886578,Larysa,Drew and Christina where both very nice and friendly. The room is small but clean and comfortable. Their parking recommendations helped us find a spot relatively close by.
5593888,96192152,2016-08-22,43872078,Michael,Great experience. Place was clean and inviting. They were very nice and really helpful in making us more comfortable in a new city.
9824,320477,2011-06-18,523286,Sunny,"The location for the Back Bay Studio (on Hereford) was excellent.  Very close to restaurants and the Prudential Center.  I stayed in Studio #1 as labelled in the pictures. Great furnishings and amenities, and wifi worked great."
Only downside was the steep,narrow stairs to get up to the 3rd floor.,,,,
"The mattress was hard but acceptable. I would definitely rent this place again.\"",,,,,
9824,645459,2011-10-19,801911,Rafael,"The apartment was small, but very cozy and very well located with just a few blocks from Prudential Center and T-subway. Apartment very clean and everything works fine. Do not recommend big luggage once there are 03 levels of stairs. Very close to several good restaurantes and bakeries."
9824,825193,2012-01-02,249121,Sara & Marc,"Great, safe location a block from Newbury Street. The studio was clean and had everything we needed -- more so, in fact, because though we didn't get around to eating in, the kitchen had a nice, new gas stove, dishwasher, and fridge. Only drawbacks were the noise from the street at night and the noise from the very creaky bed. Otherwise, good spot!"
9824,937853,2012-02-21,543631,Tora,"Our stay in Boston was lovely, thanks to Seamless Transition's super easy check-in system! The units are beautifully renovated and furnished, and it really was seamless to get into our place. The location was absolutely amazing - we were in the center of everything we visited in Boston. This is definitely the place to stay if you like to make yourself at home for a few days. The unit was also spotlessly clean. The only downsides were that it was short on the extra touch amenities that really make a place stand out - it was missing things like salt + pepper in the kitchen, shampoo in the bathroom, and kitchen towels. The main office staff was super helpful on our check out day and let us leave our bags for a number of hours. I imagine that you could request amenities if you needed them. Overall this was a great stay!"
9824,972539,2012-03-05,1762120,Ben,"Fantastic location, right on Newbury St. Clean, convenient. Pretty small, but that's no surprise when it's advertised as a 500 sq. ft. studio."
"\"",,,,,
9824,1042755,2012-03-26,1620134,Imke,Great Location!  Small but clean!  Coffee brewer but no complimentary coffee to brew!  Quiet place to sleep in a loud city.  :)
9824,1103010,2012-04-09,499891,Kate,"Excellent accommodation, efficiently hosted: I thoroughly enjoyed staying in this comfortable, attractive and well-located studio apartment while attending a conference a few blocks away, and I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to others.  Very glad that the conference hotel was full!"
9824,1146458,2012-04-17,2127265,Huntly,"Excellent location, the apartment is right on Newbury street, which is the center of town in terms of nice stores and restaurants. Its also close to public transportation, so easy to get to other areas in the city. The apartment is a 3rd floor (or higher) walkup, but wasn't a problem for me as a fit younger person. My girlfriend, however, faced some difficulties with the climb."
The space is not big,but at the discounted price its a good value. One drawback was the matress,it was firm bordering on too hard. Still fine though.,,,
"Overall I would recommend.\"",,,,,
9824,1443920,2012-06-09,2384772,Pradeep,Great location. Facility was very clean and had all the amenities needed for a short stay. My only issues were that the room and bathroom were smaller than I expected and the heat tended to make some noise.
9824,4140435,2013-04-13,4137244,Gerald,the location is super and the appartment is really comfortable.
9824,5381305,2013-06-27,6402314,Janice,"Amazing location! Clean, secure and great to have a kitchen . The only issue was the noisy air conditioning at night. Seamless was very prompt in correspondence to make sure my first Air BnB experience was positive."
9824,5854358,2013-07-19,1132053,Reiko,"This was a wonderful accommodation for much less than what a hotel in the neighborhood would cost. It is perfectly located, on a quiet side street but near all the amenities of Newberry and Boylston. The place was immaculate and well-equipped. The key-code system eliminated any logistical challenges re: getting a physical key. The only bump was that it was confusing to get the TV on and working."
9824,7319704,2013-09-15,8751492,Alison,"The studio apartment we rented was PERFECT! A very cute and clean space with a small kitchen, it was all we needed. The location was ideal right off Newbury street shops, restaurants, and walking distance to Fenway Park. The T station is just a couple blocks away which is how we chose to explore the rest of Boston. I have already recommended it to anyone I come across that has plans to visit Boston in the future. We hope to make a trip back soon and would definitely rent this spot again!"
9824,7491957,2013-09-22,8629474,Nancy,This was our first airbnb experience and it was very good.  Seemless was quick to respond to all our questions.  The room was small but that was clear in the listing.  The location could not have been better.  There were lots of towels. The lock system worked flawlessly so we didn't have to meet up with anyone for keys.  I will definitely look for Seemless in the other cities they work in.  Thanks for a great vacation.
9824,8314356,2013-10-25,7561022,Marianne,"Fantastic location, great communication, all you could need/want for your stay in Boston. Parking on Newbury St is very handy, fabulous shops and restaurants nearby. Small studio space but it's all you need for a city stay. Would definitely return."
9824,15932086,2014-07-18,9078182,Daniel,Good place in the Back Bay.  Fine system of check-in and easy communication. Thanks.
9824,16116777,2014-07-22,7963669,Madeline,Host was great communicating the info for check in quickly and clearly. Great spot for spending time in Back Bay! Just we needed in a cool neighborhood for way less than a hotel. Definitely recommend!
9824,18911397,2014-09-02,8205684,Adrienne,"My husband and I were very disappointed with our stay. The photos aren't the same photos as the room itself. These photos show a bay window and a much larger kitchen, and our room had a (non-bay) window that was covered with fire escapes and overlooked another brick building and the kitchen was significantly smaller. On top of that, a lamp didn't work, the water in the tub wouldn't drain, and it was overall in very shabby condition. We were shocked at the price we paid for a motel quality room. Needless to say, we won't be staying here again. At the price they're charging, you're better off at a hotel."
"The one good thing I will say is that the location is excellent.\"",,,,,
9824,36564591,2015-06-29,34655247,Christina,"We were able to check into our room early, which was very accomodating. The studio appartment was pretty much identical to the posting, the only exception being the amount of dust on light fixtures and appliances. The location was absolutely perfect. All parts of Boston-the Back Bay, the North End, the South End were all within walking distance. Overall, we were pleased with our stay."
9824,40261661,2015-07-29,38097403,Luke,"The apartment was nice, clean and cool! Everything I needed while staying in town for business. They also have a great system to let guests in and out of their rooms and the building, you don't have to meet up with anyone!"
9824,55355939,2015-12-01,4685641,Sophie,"This apartment is in the perfect location and is well set up. Great kitchen, bathroom and bed. Check in was easy with door codes. We were able to check in early too which was fantastic. The only criticism would be that the room is quite light due to the bay windows and shutters so we woke early every morning. It is worth it for the lovely bay window. Highly recommended."
9824,80421044,2016-06-18,52594812,Ben,"Room left a bit to be desired for the price. Small bedroom and kitchen, bathroom a bit dated. Bed not very comfortable, AC unit was a bit finicky. That said, location was tough to beat and communication / entry were seamless. Other AirBnB's in neighborhood are better- I would stay again though only as a last resort."
1868513,13022583,2014-05-17,12152966,Cathy,"I work in Boston and wanted to stay in the city to eliminate a commute during a week-long conference in the middle of commencement season, when hotel rooms are tight and rates are doubled. Having enjoyed my stay in this apartment, I look forward to future occasions to use it."
I submitted my request to Heskel late,on Saturday night,seeking a Mon-Fri booking,so I was pleasantly surprised when I heard from him late Sunday night,just after I'd booked a hotel room instead.  He was professional and flexible,arranging for me to stay from Tuesday - Friday.
The location is perfect: easy walk to the Pru and the Southwest Corridor park. The pictures are accurate. This first floor unit is opposite the door to the garage and mailboxes,an active area before and after work,"but it quieted down after dinnertime. The bedroom is quiet and the bed comfortable.  I would stay here again. \"",,,
1868513,19371390,2014-09-11,14740639,Marie,A very good location and very well maintained apartment that delivered on all what it had promised. A charming garden space complimented the well suited apartment coupled with very friendly neighbors and concierge services. A highly recommended place for a perfect short or even long stay. We will definitely stay there when we go back to Boston. Thanks Heskel.
1868513,20052061,2014-09-22,20978498,Ruth,"The apartment was dated but clean. Location is good. Still considered back bay but closer to the south end. Check in and check out was pretty easy, but I tried to call the after hours number (5:30pm) which was unsuccessful. No one picked up and the automated system just hung up on me. I figured it out so it wasn't a big deal. Parking is available but expensive.   I would recommend staying here."

The apartment is fully furnished down to the last spoon and fork, just bring your personal items.  South Boston restaurants and retail shops start just a few feet away, and it's only a short walk to the burgeoning Seaport area and the Boston Convention Center.  Convenient bus service is at the corner, connecting to the subways only a few blocks away.  Best of all: the gracious, accommodating hosts (Jinny and Cody) are right upstairs to take care of any little thing you might need."

Despite the fact that we arrived after midnight & she was leaving early the next morning, she still greeted us & showed us around the apartment. She reached out the next day to make sure all was OK & even sent me a link for a discount to something she thought we might be interested in doing (all while she was vacationing). The apartment itself was lovely & had everything we needed. It was a very easy walk to the convention center & also to a T stop for easy access to downtown & other Boston sights (and if you like to walk, it's less than an hour to downtown)."

They made room in the fridge for us to store food too. The neighborhood is near Boston University so lots of college kids, but it was still quiet for a Friday night and the neighborhood is safe in the late night hours. We had a chance to chat with the newlyweds and found them to be extremely welcoming and charming. I would stay here anytime when visiting Boston. The bed was very comfortable, the neighborhood is full of eateries to choose from, the room was private, quiet, and comfortable. This was the first time we stayed in a private room instead of an entire rental and the experience did not disappoint! Thank you for a lovely place to stay!"
5889190,47944789,2015-09-21,34672273,Steve,"Roger and Sophie were excellent hosts! They were friendly and welcoming and knowledgeable. Their apartment was clean and easy to find - its just a couple blocks off the subway line. Easy access to downtown Boston and there's plenty of restaurants and bars by their apartment as well. Overall, great hosts and a great experience! I'd definitely recommend reaching out to them when you need a place to stay."
5889190,48186092,2015-09-24,40402869,Marie,The location of the apartment was perfect for our first time visit to Boston! We stayed to get a feel for the city and the Boston University campus. The apartment was decorated nice with a clean and welcoming atmosphere. Roger and Sophie were friendly and provided us with information about the area while answering any questions we had. We arrived earlier than expected but it was not a problem at all and they were both very quick to respond to any messages before our arrival.

Prior to my stay, Sophie kept in constant communication and assured that all of my requests would be accommodated. Although it was a school night, I was able to have a late check-in time and make dinner reservations with a friend. The room was exactly as described. The room and bathroom were spotless which I appreciated because I'm a neat freak. Roger and Sophie provided towels and a key for easy access. I have absolutely no complaints and hope to visit again!"

I didn't use their kitchen, but it's beautiful, and the morning light is terrific. The bathroom was well appointed, and the hot water was nice and hot!"
Most important,both Sophie and Roger were great hosts. I spoke more with Sophie,and she is charming and welcoming. And when I met Roger,"I could see that they both care about their guests and aim to help them have a perfect stay. I'd recommend staying in their home to anyone.\"",,
5889190,56530786,2015-12-14,34139621,Laura,"Roger and Sophie's place is exactly as described - clean, quiet and safe."

The room is great! super clean,organized,and spacious. Their place is located really close to the Green Line on the T and there is easy access to several buses. Getting around the city was a breeze! There are also a lot of great restaurants,bars,"and cafes within a 5 min walk. I totally recommend staying here. Thank you Sophie and Roger!!\"",
5889190,61869625,2016-02-08,47105977,Nathan,"Sophie & Roger's apartment is as advertised, and more! Large, comfortable room on a residential street in Allston.  The hosts were able to accommodate us on short notice, and they greeted us as soon as we arrived.  Very affordable compared with hotels in the area."
5889190,62109123,2016-02-11,44874336,Zack,I had a wonderful time staying with Roger and Sophie. The room was immaculate and they are fantastic hosts! I'd absolutely recommend staying with them.
5889190,62321535,2016-02-13,57956832,顺子,The hosts are very nice! I had a very helpful experience here. And the warm sunlight shined through the window and it gave me a warm hug in the cold winter of the city.
5889190,62458115,2016-02-14,57328472,Maurie,"I had a great first AirBnB experience. Rodger and Sophie were very accommodating to my late arrival time and were very welcoming. Their home was neat and hosted a clean, spotless bedroom and bath. I'd highly recommend this host to anyone visiting the Boston area."
5889190,62740965,2016-02-16,53996247,James,"I was amazed by how bright and sunny the room was. I had one of the most rock-solid nights of sleep at Roger and Sophie's place; I slept like a hammer. The residence was very warm the entire time I was there, and there are potted plants everywhere. I took a shower and the bathroom felt clean and homey. The kitchen was neat but and there are plenty of evidence of their lives all over the cute decorations."
5889190,63940244,2016-02-28,42947125,Hao,Roger and Sophie are the best host and hostess you would meet anywhere. They're very friendly and would go into lengths to make your stay pleasant. Sophie lent me her HDMI cable when we bought a projector for our nightly movies but forgot to bring our own cable.
The neighborhood is ideal. Allston is a foodie heaven. Perfectly safe,always lively with many people and can offer many activities over the weekend. The street on which we stayed,on the contrary,is quiet and peaceful,,
Overnight parking can be tricky. You'll have to park a bit further away due to Resident-only restriction. But it wasn't a big bother at all.,,,,,
"The floor can creak a bit but the bed was very nice and comfortable.\"",,,,,
5889190,64958107,2016-03-09,12572783,Sharon,"Roger and Sophie are friendly and hospitable. Roger even carried my luggage to the 3rd floor. Their home is clean, bright and located in a quiet neighborhood and only 5 minutes walk to Packards Corner Green Line T Station.  I highly recommend their home."
5889190,65674695,2016-03-16,25821034,Michelle,"We really appreciated how CLEAN Roger and Sophie's place is! From the bathroom sink to the nooks and crannies of the hardwood baseboards, it was spotless. Roger and Sophie were both quiet and very kind and welcoming. We enjoyed the nearby restaurants and the cute neighborhood."
5889190,65899762,2016-03-17,62588068,Bj2008o,"Actually I booked three nights for my son who spent Sping Break in Boston. No doubt he enjoyed his stay with Roger and Sophie, even joined the Wedding of their neighbour. What a surprise! I think I shall experience myself once I travel to Boston."
5889190,67263416,2016-03-27,22023346,Romain,We stayed 2 nights for Easter weekend at Roger and Sophie's place.
They were very welcoming and very helpful,we were allowed to use their fridge to put our stuff,"Roger even did us a \"\"damn good coffee\"\" the first morning! The appartment is clean and the room was very comfy. The area is really calm and safe and the subway station is only at a 5min walking distance.",,,
"Nothing else to add except that everything was great!\"",,,,,
5889190,67721621,2016-03-30,9231868,Diane,"Roger & Sophie were upbeat, nice, and helpful hosts!  Although I was only there for two days, we got to chat a bit, and I had a great time!  I got the sense that they've really thought about every detail of the guest experience:  The room came with a large desk with a corner of tourism pamphlets, plenty of surfaces to spread out your belongings, a very comfy bed, fast WiFi, several electrical outlets/convenient power strips, a full-length mirror, a bottle of water, a carabiner for the housekey...And on top of that, the room and all the shared spaces (kitchen and bathroom) were impeccably clean, which I love!  Lots of sunlight and healthy plants in the kitchen.  Roger was excellent with AirBnb messaging and helped me with my bags on the way out.  I was very happy with this stay and wouldn't have changed a thing.  Thank you, Roger and Sophie!"
5889190,68534122,2016-04-05,63759681,Elya,"The apartment was very nice and clean, and the neighborhood was great.  We enjoyed being able to make our own breakfasts in the morning and the proximity of the T, restaurants, and two groceries (one Asian)."
5889190,69170399,2016-04-09,5845189,Leah,"Sophie was traveling during my stay, but Roger was the perfect host—responsive, flexible, and a pleasure to chat with. He made it extremely easy for me to get into the apartment (even though I had to show up at an odd hour of the evening). The room was tidy, comfortable, and large. The building was close to the green line; it was super easy to get around. I'll definitely book here again..."
5889190,69720551,2016-04-12,57587297,Tony,"非常好和友善的一对房东。时刻与我们保持联系。因为我在国内的飞机晚点,没有按时到达波士顿,经过沟通后马上给我退款房费,相当的称赞。Roger也是很友善,这次Sophie回中国没有见到,期待下次的波士顿之行能够见到你!谢谢你们!"
5889190,70052149,2016-04-15,23860544,Lady,"Roger was great! My schedule was crazy but he was able to accommodate me, which was very nice of him. The room was clean and pretty spacious. Overall, great experience!!"

The room was very clean and Roger and Sophie were very nice and made sure everything was ready when we arrived. The unit is located not too far from downtown and only a couple blocks away from the subway. Roger was even nice enough to recommend a great Italian restaurant for us the last night of our stay. I would highly recommend them for your choice!
5889190,70923680,2016-04-22,6172114,Sam,"Sophie and roger have a great room, super comfy bed in a nice apartment. An easy place to catch the train to and find your way around."
And they are cool people to share a space with!,,,,,
All round good experience,,,,,
"Thanks guys\"",,,,,
5889190,71346732,2016-04-24,39065931,Ganesh,"I could not have asked for a better Airbnb experience! With Roger and Sophie, they left no stone unturned, I felt so welcome and comfortable staying in their home. They were meticulous in their preparation for my visit: all the instructions for me were clear before my arrival, they provided me with all the basic amenities during my short stay, and the room itself was tidy and spacious. I felt extremely satisfied with my choice to stay in their room. I would love to come back if I'm ever in the Boston area in the future! One-hundred percent recommend."
5889190,71869860,2016-04-29,17503888,Francisco,My stay was brief but Roger and Sophie were both very kind and accommodating.  The room is very spacious and the bed is comfortable.  The apartment is also easily accessible to public transportation and ideal for exploring Boston!
5889190,72720062,2016-05-04,61298092,Valentina,"Roger and Sophie are a very nice couple and their place is really comfortable. The area is full of restaurants and bars, and the subway station is pretty close. The room was really tidy and clean."
5889190,72804708,2016-05-04,25251833,Menglong,Decent room. Great location and anything else.
5889190,72871476,2016-05-05,44624930,Betty-Ann,"\"Listing is completely accurate and Sophie and Roger were gracious hosts. They couldn't have helped the 3am trash pick-up! As others have noted, many steps to the apt and no elevator, for the \"\"step challenged\"\" that's important info. Still"
5889190,73083973,2016-05-06,66132083,Tiantong,"Very nice couple, a comfortable stay!"
5889190,73455226,2016-05-08,36228224,Barbara,Roger and Sophie's place was clean and comfortable and they were proactive and easy to communicate with.  It is important to note that the bathroom is shared and that the room is on the third floor without an elevator.  I can recommend it highly to those seeking a room on a limited budget.
5889190,73722293,2016-05-09,53996247,James,Another great trip thanks to Roger and Sophie! Not a hitch in the stay.
5889190,73879149,2016-05-11,22230309,Samantha,Roger and Sophie's place is exactly as pictured. Our check in and out was really easy and we felt right at home. The location was perfect for us and roger was very knowledgable about sightseeing options and where to eat. Hopefully one day we can return to Boston as we would definitely stay here again.
5889190,74171330,2016-05-13,9687020,Cat,"All was great. Cute clean house, great location, friendly hosts! Definitely recommend."
5889190,75033085,2016-05-18,4759103,Jill,Roger was the one I dealt with. I never saw Sophie. He was amazing. I needed to book very last minute for 2 nights. He talked to me at a late hour before my stay and answered my questions. Upon my arrival he carried my bag up. The room is exactly as described and large. He is a caring guy and great with any of your needs.  He even lent me a phone charger. Not far from the T.
5889190,75541177,2016-05-22,16600232,Violet Xue,"The room is very spacious and clean. I feel the host have been keeping everything in order, so the whole environment is very friendly and comfortable."
5889190,76097867,2016-05-24,25774209,Jennifer,Roger and Sophie were great and the location in a neighborhood within walking distance of the Boston University campus was perfect for our needs.  Both Roger and Sophie were friendly and gracious about answering our many questions and making recommendations about travel options and food choices in the area.  Sophie was very prompt with email communication ahead of time and also on the day of our arrival.
5889190,76846658,2016-05-29,7702534,Melanie,Had a great stay at this Airbnb. The room was big and the house was clean. They also provided us with clean towels and water too!
5889190,77490372,2016-06-01,29900303,Elaine,"Great location and really friendly hosts! The room was spacious and it was nice to be able to use the kitchen. The shower in the bathroom had great water pressure. The floor is a little creaky, which never bothered us, but I worried that at night it woke up our hosts!"
5889190,77757682,2016-06-03,32730225,Yunqiu,"Highly recommended! Roger and Sophie were very good BNBers. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. It was close to the Green Line and had countless restaurant nearby. I believe that Sophie is a Chinese, right? Sometimes I could hear Chinese TV shows. LOL"
5889190,78009340,2016-06-05,21339571,Cate,"Roger and Sophie made us feel very welcome. We mainly interacted with Roger, who met us upon arrival, gave us a key and got us settled.  He gave us recommendations for dinner and some grocery shopping we needed to do the next day.  The apartment is very well located, close to lots of bars and restaurants and the T, and the neighborhood felt very safe.  It was also only about a 30 minute walk to Fenway Park.  The room is bare bones, but you're only sleeping in it!  Get out and see Boston!"
5889190,78154279,2016-06-05,22816147,Annie,"Roger & sophie were very kind hosts and made us feel very welcome! We changed our arrival time multiple times, and they were very accommodating despite the inconvenience we caused. The room was clean and spacious and exactly as photographed. Roger even helped us bring our giant suitcase upstairs :-) I'd definitely recommend this listing!"
5889190,80817070,2016-06-19,74934245,Sarah,Roger and Sophie were very accommodating and quick to respond to any questions. We only met Roger but he was very friendly and gave us great recommendations on spots to eat and places to go around the city! Very nice private room and location was close to the train in a nice neighborhood.
5889190,81476504,2016-06-23,44489931,Mai,I love the room a lot. Best choice in Boston. I'll choose to stay with Roger and Sophie again.
5889190,81768543,2016-06-25,9077447,Jennifer,"Roger was waiting for me when I arrived, and he let me in and showed me the room and bathroom and gave me a key to use while I was there. He gave me some good recommendations on what to do and how to get around. I took his suggestions and had a lovely, quick trip in Boston. I was so busy sight seeing, that I never got to meet Sophie, or spend any time getting to know them, but I couldn't have asked for cleaner, more comfortable accommodations."
5889190,82188613,2016-06-26,9850666,Wei,"My daughter and I had a wonderful time staying with Roger and Sophie.  They are helpful and welcoming.  Their place is nice clean and super convenient...  Lots of nice restaurant in walking distance, definitely recommend!!"
5889190,83073364,2016-07-01,79934623,Binita,Neightborhood was good and hosts were warm and nice. The room was as listed and well-kept.
5889190,84613723,2016-07-08,16364471,Audrey,My fiance and I stayed at this place while visiting Boston for a couple of days.
The apartment is located in the Boston College neighbourhood,which was peaceful and safe,albeit a little far away from downtown. The tram station is just a stone's throw away but it takes about 20 minutes to get to  downtown by tram.,,,
Roger and Sophie were not in when we arrived,but they left clear instructions to let ourselves in,so check-in was smooth. The bedroom given to us is actually their own master bedroom,and not a guest room We found a little awkward to be sleeping in their bedroom while they slept in the living room. Nonetheless,the bedroom was great. It was clean and spacious,and was exactly as described. The bathroom was also clean and we loved the large shower head.
Roger and Sophie were very friendly hosts,but they usually stayed out of our way,presumably to give us a more comfortable stay. We would have preferred to have more interaction with our hosts though.,,,
Overall,"we highly recommend this place!\"",,,,
5889190,85135192,2016-07-10,54664285,Nicola,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 day visit with Sophie and Roger and therir quiet, clean, light filled apartment.  As both of us are city kids, we enjoyed all the city places we negotiated to by public transportation that is safe, clean, cheap and efficient.  The neighborhood is a polyglot mix of students, professionals and hard working Boston folk.  We liked it all very much, even enjoying the challenge of finding free local parking which in our part of NY (Albany) is heavily metered!  We got terrific advice from Sophie and Roger on where to eat and each eve relaxed in a cool, very clean, quiet, shady bedroom.  Boston has so much going for it as a destination; great parks, museums - we booked seats at Fenway with no trouble and enjoyed the game very much in addition to all our city walks and excursions.  Highly recommended, but check out Frommers or another guide ahead of time to maximise a smooth visit and definitely take advantage of excellent public transportation and don't forget to buy your Charlie cards!"
7283351,40644253,2015-08-01,34369220,Kathrin,"The room was clean and tidy. The apartment was totally fine and Elham's roommate was very nice and helpful. Unfortunately, I never met Elham in person, but we stayed in touch via e-mail during my stay."
7283351,43110604,2015-08-17,25174316,Lydia,"The area is more like a college town feel, and since I stayed during the summer with windows open, there was a lot of partying going on in the evenings by the neighbors, if you have a hard time sleeping with noises then it might not work for you. I had no problems because I sleep easily and I liked the feeling of busy activity since I'm from a big city."
Elham was not there during my stay but her roommate was very nice and able to offer me advice and help me out about info on the local transportation system and the lodging in general.,,,,,
Even though she wasn't there,"Elham still did a wonderful job of making my stay as comfortable and smooth as possible and she was always easily in contact. She even went as far as ordering a blanket and having it shipped when we thought her original blanket was not there. I really appreciated this. Thank you!\"",,,,
7283351,49842964,2015-10-06,26676643,Seth,"This is a convenient location, particularly if you want to be on the Green Line without spending a lot of money. Like many of these Allston apartments, it's an older building and a small apartment, but it was clean and well-kept. I did not see Elham for more than 10 minutes, but she kept in communication through email and text message. If you're a light sleeper, know that you can hear the T and general neighborhood noise through the windows. Also, it's an older window (no double-pane) near the bed, so bring appropriate nightwear if you get cold when you sleep (tho Elham did provide a comforter and blankets). Overall, if you're looking for an inexpensive place to stay when you visit Boston, this is a fine option."
7283351,52344477,2015-10-28,42493878,Joe,"\"I had a very pleasant stay at Elham's home. This room is in a great location in Allston! When she says \"\"steps to green line\"\" she is not kidding; the T is literally less than 50 steps from the front door of the building. The T grinding to a halt every fifteen minutes or so may be troublesome for a light sleeper"
7283351,70641175,2016-04-19,9211253,Sheldon,"I had a great time staying at Elham's place! It was perfect for what I needed in the days leading up to the Boston Marathon. Its right on the train line with super close access to buses as well, so I had quick access to the everything centrally but was located in a quiet enough neighborhood where I could have some privacy and relaxation."
5434353,45246764,2015-09-01,33941185,Elisabeth,Anthony bent over backwards to accommodate our needs. He has been a kind and considerate host. We have had an extended stay between homes and were able to bring some of our things with us.
"The location is perfect for us and the neighborhood pleasant and quiet with nice neighbors upstairs. \"",,,,,
5434353,57797279,2015-12-29,49939319,John,We had a great stay.  Our two adult children stayed in the house and it was better than described.  The house was very clean and larger than we expected.  Anthony was extremely helpful.  He even responded on Christmas Day to a question that we had.  We would definitely stay here again in the future!
5434353,64362357,2016-03-03,23712912,Lucy,"We stayed in Anthony's lovely apartment for a month after moving to Boston from London with our two cats, and Anthony was very helpful and accommodating about the whole situation. He allowed us to have  items mailed to the house beforehand since our flight was arriving late, and stocked the kitchen and bathroom with essentials. He kept in touch throughout the stay to make sure we were ok, and provided us with helpful information about the area."
5434353,66769360,2016-03-24,15979835,Lila,"Great neighborhood with a park right across the way.  House isn't modern, but was clean and comfortable with everything we needed for our stay.  Anthony was very responsive and respectful without being intrusive.   There is a nice neighbor with a dog that lives above the apartment.  I definitely recommend renting this home."
5434353,71844489,2016-04-29,53032929,Sabine,"The Place was Niveau, a Little bot old fashioned but perfectly prepared with shower gels and the basic groceries ."
The public transportation into Boston and the shops near by is nice & easy. The only thing I would have wanted to know before is that there are dogs living in the upstairs because of my allergy.,,,,,
"I would stay there again and do recommend this place.\"",,,,,
5434353,77961207,2016-06-04,15046060,Steven,"Anthony was great. Very helpful. House location is fantastic. Close to a park and the Harvard botanical gardens.  And it came with off street parking. All my needs were met and Roslindale has a shall town feel, yet it's Boston. Very nice."
5434353,91824435,2016-08-06,56273327,Xin,"Such a nice place, both Lucy and Anthony are very nice."
1112193,4698016,2013-05-20,6390077,Zaahir,The place was great! Steve was really welcoming and accommodating.
1112193,5625779,2013-07-08,2884822,Gigi,"Steve was a wonderful host! The room, while not fancy, was very comfortable. There was a a heat wave during our stay, so we were extra pleased to discover the room was air conditioned. It was like a cool oasis in a hot and humid sauna. Steve went the extra mile for us, too. We accidentally left a power strip containing chargers for our phone and computer in the room. Steve called, got our address, and shipped it back to us the same day! That's what I call service! The neighborhood is quiet, people were friendly, and there's a T station less than 2 blocks away! Why pay more to stay in the city and deal with the traffic and parking nightmare when you can stay in Warm and Cozy Room B? We'll be back!"
1112193,5995702,2013-07-25,2686348,Deb,"\"Nice location.  Easy access to the \"\"T\"\" subway system.  Quiet stay.  Steve was helpful"
1112193,6965221,2013-09-01,7619067,Noa,We booked a room at Steve's without really knowing what to expect. When we arrived we were treated as family - Steve took us to see the townl and there were some supplies in the kitchen to help us after a long flight.
Steve and Khalio's hospitality throughout our stay,which was a little longer than 3 weeks,was more than we could hope for.,,,
The host is kind,generous,thoughtful,friendly and very funny! Also Khalio who is in charge of maintenance was very nice (we made dinner together sometimes,went shopping for the house and he helped us move to our apartment when our stay at Steve's was over).,
The place itself is clean,quiet and cozy. The kitchen is for the guests to use (very convenient to make your own food),it has all the appliances. The house is located very close to the T Andrew Station (red line) which brings you downtown in 12 minutes.,,,
We highly recomment a stay at Steve's if you're coming to Boston,no matter how long your stay is... Don't think twice!,,,,

Steeve a été très accomodant car nous sommes arrivés dans la nuit et nous avons eu le plaisir d'avoir une visite guidée de Boston! Idéalement située car la maison est à 5 min d'une station de métro."
je recommande cet hôte!,,,,,
we stayed three nights in sweet and warm home,the room was comfortable and big,the kitchen and the living room were available for everybody. Steeve is very nice because we arrived very late in the night and he brong us for a nice tourism tour in his car. the house is at 5min away to the metro station;,,,
I will recommend this home to everybody!,,,,,
THANKS YOU SO MUCH STEEVE!,,,,,

1112193,7318250,2013-09-15,2688347,Tristiane,We had an awesome time at Steve's!
The room was just perfect,spacious and light with a comfy bed. We were able to us the rest of the house too,kitchen for breakfast and we even watched TV in the living room when we were too tired to go out.,,,
Steve was a fantastic host,he met us at the house and gave us tips for dinner,where to go and how to take the T like pros. He even offered us some museum tickets that sadly we did not get to take advantage of. I would highly recommend staying at Steve's in Boston,it was easy to get to downtown on the T (about 25 mins) and we really enjoyed wandering around Dorchester as well.,,

Kahlio (the guy who maintains the house) and Steve are very helpful and kind people. Steve even gave us a ride to the T the last day (it was raining and we had big luggage). The house is 10 minutes walking to the T station and from there the train takes between 10-15 minutes to Downtown. I definitely recommend Steve's house."

Steve is a very nice guy, he waited us till very late when we arrived there, and guys in the house are really good, chatting with us, giving nice food to us. And the red line is just ten minute away from Steve's, which is easy to access to the downtown of Boston. Just one little disadvantage is that we need to do shower upstairs. But still very nice!"

I kept in touch with Steve from the moment I booked the room until the time I met him in person. He answered all my questions and concerns and was incredibly accommodating! ... Steve's hospitality began the moment I made the reservation, but it increased ten-fold the instant I informed him we were in Boston. When I told him we arrived, he insisted on picking us up at South Station and driving us to the apartment. Immediately when we met him, he was as kind as could be! We talked and he told us about himself. He told us about the neighborhood and how to get to and from the subway... The neighborhood was safe and easy to get around in. There are a few really good eateries to enjoy too! ..."

1112193,15693965,2014-07-14,16548564,Martin,The positives were...
Our host was very friendly and communicated with us in a very timely fashion. Everything was as he said it would be. The room was comfortable,although not the room shown in the picture. We loved being so close to Boston. It was a very short drive to downtown,and the train is very close.,,,
The negatives were...,,,,,
The bathroom is shared with a number of other guests,and the location is in a rather rundown area of the city. Although not a significant issue as we didn't spend a lot of time there,"but out and about in a beautiful city.\"",,,
1112193,15806649,2014-07-15,17735923,Dominik,We stayed there for 1 night to visit Boston. The place was clean and Steve was really friendly. He showed us a nice park and took us to the Tube station. However we didn't spend a lot of time in the house as there was plenty to see in Boston ;)
1112193,16013064,2014-07-20,13943355,Coline,"We spent only one night in the room. Clio and Steve were very attentive and hospitable. The room was comfortable and spacious. The breakfast was included in the service and it was alright. The room is 20min far from Boston centre in subway. And the subway station is 5-10min walk from the house. If you want to visit Boston, I think it is a little far to entirely enjoy your stay. But it's a good place!"
1112193,17323178,2014-08-10,3918999,Jessi,Steve and his housemates were very understanding and accommodating.  It was a very stress-free visit - once I figured out where the house was and how to get there.

1112193,19740097,2014-09-17,20333344,Sarah,"Overall I was quite happy with our stay. The place is clean and cosy, and loved that we had full use of the kitchen. It is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood, very close to the T train. Unfortunately my rating would be higher only for it had not been made clear to us the address before arrival. I had made contact with Steve and made all arrangement of arrival but still was not made aware the address we were staying was not the same as the address I was given in my confirmation. This took some confusion, unanswered calls while dragging bags around the neighborhood and some time of waiting before being informed of the correct address. However, once this confusion was resolved all was smooth sailing! I did not meet Steve but met Khalil and he was very pleasant and helpful."
1112193,21602193,2014-10-20,21536692,Barbara Et Florian,Nous avons très bien été accueillis. Personnes très serviables et de très bon conseils. Le logement est dans un quartier très calme et à 20 minutes de la gare routière en métro donc très pratique.

We were a little caught off-guard by the number of people living/staying in the house, but we had a great time interacting with the other guests and permanent residents of the home.  We didn't actually meet Steve until we left, but he was very helpful leading up to our stay.  It's in a great neighborhood that felt very safe.  A quick 7-8 minute walk to the T and about a 15-20 minute ride into downtown.  I would definitely stay there again if I were to return to Boston!"

Nous avons pu laisser l'auto devant la maison tout le temps de notre séjour et utiliser les transports en commun, ce qui est très pratique."

Close to a good place for breakfast, Ashleys. Room was clean and a comfortable size for two people, had city/activity material, and Steve had good communication.

1112193,34750861,2015-06-11,30459168,Lewis,"I cannot rate this listing enough. Steve and Khalio were very friendly; we were greeted when we arrived and shown around the house, given fresh towels and the wifi password and we had all our Boston questions answered. The room was immaculate and the bed was very comfortable. There is unlimited free tea and coffee which was a huge bonus. Newly refurbished bathroom as well with a great shower. There is also a second bathroom upstairs so me and my travel mate were always able to get ready etc. Steve was in constant contact when required and offered plenty of site seeing advice. We opted to stay an additional night on top of our booking but the room was taken but Steve still went out of his way to accommodate us and we ended up staying in a secondary house just around the corner, which, wasn't fully decorated but we were given a much lower rate. I would definitely recommend this listing to others and next time I'm in Boston I'll be staying here again. The house location is also ideal, only 2 minutes walk from Fields Corner train stop."

We needed clean, budget lodging and Steve's room met both criteria.  We met Steve as we were leaving and had a very nice conversation.  My daughter and I were impressed by his friendliness and willingness to give us advice."

Mais il à toujours répondu aux message,et aux questions que nous avions à propos du logement.,,,,
La chambre était très bien,spacieuse et propre.,,,,
Surprise de voir autant de monde cohabiter,mais pour passer seulement 2 nuits ce n'était pas un problème.,,,,
Seul problème,le partage de la salle de bain avec les autres personnes qui louait une chambre. (Laisser les serviettes de bain n'importe ou,les cheveux partout..) bref,cela ne donne pas envie d'engager la conversation.,,

His driveway offers a safe and free parking space saving me a lot of headaches versus if I insist in staying around downtown Boston.  With the subway stop less than a minute walk from his house, travel time to downtown Boston on public transit was like 15 minutes.  Overall experience was excellent.  Price is fair.  Neighborhood is really convenient and the host is very helpful."

We just saw Steve once and there were several other guys whom we met in Steve's house. The bathroom was also so clean and Steve was super nice and friendly. The house was 5 minutes walk to train station and the Boston Red line was great but just the neighborhood was not so good and safe.

They even have a TV with cable in the room, which was good for having some downtime after walking all day.  We met a range of people at the house, from all different countries- which was very neat! There is also a drive way if you drive up or rent a car."
The house is about a 7 minute walk from the train,which was very convenient. The neighborhood was ok,not a lot of food or stores nearby that I saw. I felt much safer at night,since I was traveling with my boyfriend. However,as a woman,I would not come back to this neighborhood alone

The bathroom was reasonably clean but evidently shared with a long term tenant. The neighborhood is somewhat rough around the edges. There was off street parking directly behind the house, a feature we did appreciate. The outside of the house needs some attention which would help in making guests feel more welcome & secure. Steve allowed us to stow our bicycles in an unoccupied bedroom on the first floor and kindly helped us bring them in the house."

1112193,51326052,2015-10-19,834867,Alexander,"Had a nice stay overall. Steve is a very nice guy. Room is big and quite cosy. However this is more of a private room in a hostel than your average airbnb locations. Bathrooms are either upstairs or all the way across the house. Dorchester is okay, but there are nicer (and more expensive) areas in Boston. T Station is very close, as well as a bar and a few Vietnamese places around."
1112193,52705115,2015-11-01,44371320,Jess,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was great!! Steve was really sweet and helpful, professional, and friendly too! His house is adorable and in a great location with easy access to the T, which was helpful for us. My favorite was the bed(soooo comfy!!!) and how clean everything was maintained. Really stellar!"
1112193,53033580,2015-11-03,13710417,Thomas,"The room was warm and cozy, just like the posting.  Steve was very accomodating."
1112193,53885681,2015-11-14,36887679,Kristina,"Steve was a wonderful host, he answered all our questions and helped us with other issues! The other people living in the house were also really open and friendly :) The room was quiet and nice, and we could use the kitchen and laundry, which was very handy. The location is close to the subway line that brings you directly downtown. The neighborhood is ok, but there are definitely nicer areas in Boston. However, we never felt unsafe. The room was not heated very well, but we had a thick blanket and slept well."
1112193,54423364,2015-11-19,41534085,Nora,Steve was a really great host! He was very helpful in giving advice on attractions in the area. His room was neat and clean. He was also very accommodating on my arrival which was very helpful.
1112193,55571191,2015-12-02,21732909,Andreas,"As many already told; Steve is a great host. Though I arrived late, Steve did make sure that everything went smooth - even in the middle of the night. Overall a friendly atmosphere in the house. Nice neighborhood with Ronin Park just around the corner. With great views over the city. Will be back."
1112193,65468009,2016-03-13,20337819,Tony,It's a great choice if you are on budget.
1112193,67626364,2016-03-30,61861568,Christina,Steve was a very easy going and helpful host. He made our weekend in Boston easy!
1112193,68563690,2016-04-05,64325870,Saumya,"It was our pleasure to stay at Steve's place. He made our (I and my husband) weekend stay very comfortable by allowing us to check in late and providing us with details of wifi and city tour. The place was clean and all the house inmates were very hospitable. Enjoyed the stay with no interference or inconvenience at all. Thank you Steve, look forward to staying with you again!"

1112193,71123618,2016-04-23,21045432,Adriana,Big room and great location. Very good deal.
1112193,72029532,2016-04-30,48725659,Michael,"Steve was an absolute pleasure to work with. He was very responsive and accommodating.  It was only a $15 uber (about 15-20min drive) into the heart of downtown Boston, so it was the best/most affordable way to stay close to the city without paying a ton. Overall, it was a wonderful experience, I would highly suggest!!"
1112193,72278389,2016-05-01,16884309,Shirley,"I stayed at Steve's house for a night while I was in Boston and had a very comfortable stay. The house is in Dorchester, which is not far at all from downtown Boston. I had a car with me that I was able to find park easily by the house. The bedroom itself was incredibly clean with a large comfy bed and TV that had Netflix and cable! Bathroom was also nice and clean. Although I didn't meet Steve in person, we communicated throughout my stay and he was very responsive. All amenities provided."
1112193,72648815,2016-05-04,42801712,Lazuli,"The room was not as was advertised, it advertised two beds, but I was given single bed. When mentioned, I was offered another room which to me is not an appropriate and necessary based on what was advertised. If someone is particular about cleanliness, this place may not be the best choice. Based on the room charge, the rest of the things were ok. One should not expect a great neighborhood which is normal for the room rate."
1112193,74037057,2016-05-12,9796602,Tinghim,"The best host ever in USA, he is very welcoming and caring. Steve chats with us all the time, and help us to solve different problems. He provided us with breakfast, and introduced us to various nice spots in Boston. He shows the best hospitality to us, and i hope more people can try it as well."

1112193,74418895,2016-05-15,70076597,Salonie,"I had a wonderful experience for my first AirBnB with Steve's listing! The house is about a quick 5 mins walk from the Fields Corner Station and Steve left very clear instructions about where to find the key, access our room etc. The room was beautifully prepared, complete with mints and fresh towels. I can see why he has so many positive reviews, and I am very glad to add to them. Thank you Steve!"
1112193,74984969,2016-05-18,17006849,Gaétane,"Steve really made us feel like we were at home! The room was really comfortable and the only regret we had was to stay only one night! Steve was really welcoming, friendly and super helpful, giving us great tips to discover Boston! He is awesome! I would truly recommend you his place if you want to make a great friend and to stay at a super well located place (the T station is so close from downtown Boston)!"
1112193,75493428,2016-05-21,63761819,Yan,"a nice landlord. He is so friendly to both my mother and me. Everyday, he even offered us Chinese newspaper. Also, he cleans up the house everyday. a friendly and diligent landlord!!"

1112193,80317087,2016-06-17,19811866,Kevin,Very welcoming and accommodating host.  I had a moving target for my arrival time due to flight delays and Steve was able to work around this to get us access to the house and get the room ready very quickly.  Very nice period house in a changing neighborhood with lots of good Asian eateries nearby and a short walk to the T.  Excellent value for Boston.
1112193,81218269,2016-06-21,66900615,Chun Wang,"Thank you for being nice and friendly to us. The room had a TV, I love watching TV. ahax"

1112193,82868553,2016-06-30,52232789,Leon,Steve was a wonderful host and there was water dispenser and coffee machine in the kitchen for free use. It was no problem to check in late. So we could get something to eat in the city after the flight. We arrived at 10 pm at the near train station. The room was just like in the pictures and the bed was pretty comfy. Overall we had a nice stay
1112193,83504637,2016-07-03,52120519,Vu,"Steve was very friendly. The place was clean, comfortable, and close to the train station. It was definitely a good deal."

1112193,85463705,2016-07-11,68607679,Ronald,"Steve was a GREAT host. Place wasn't to nice, but the most important... CLEAN. VERY CLEAN. Front yard needs a lot of work. The place is a little to far away from District Center, Downtown, Fenuil Hall, etc. , but it's not a big deal, because the closest subway station is 3.5 minutes walk. Definitely, I'LL BE BACK !!!"
"\"",,,,,
1112193,86004569,2016-07-14,72138468,Anneke,Steve was really nice. He showed us around the house and we had a little chat. The room was comfy and everything was just very good.
1112193,86007601,2016-07-14,34436714,Vijay,"Steve is among the finest of hosts. He had communicated so well, about how to get in, which room would be mine, and had kept a lot of brochures about Boston. He even called to make sure that I was home and everything was fine. If in Boston, the next time, I will again want to be here!"
1112193,87127347,2016-07-18,77772392,Elise,"Nous n'avons jamais rencontré notre hôte alors qu'il nous avait dit qu'il serait présent. Il n'habite pas dans le logement qu'il loue. À notre arrivée, nous ne savions pas comment entrer dans le logement, pas de réponse à la porte, ni au téléphone, et aucune consigne ou réponse par courriel. Nous avons fini par trouver les clés dans la boîte aux lettres et nous avons dû appeler Steve 22 fois avant qu'il nous réponde car il n'y avait pas de chambre avec 2 lits, contrairement à ce qui était indiqué sur l'annonce."
1112193,87521964,2016-07-20,68756894,齊 Chi,Steve is a nice guy. He introduced the city to us and let us the drop off our bags before check in time. But the room is a little bit small and not quite clean.

Basically everything is available to you. You get a bathroom, washer and drier, and the kitchen and a common living space. There were other people staying in the house too and they were very nice. I would stay here again!"
1112193,90614803,2016-08-01,25751376,Yousra,"Due to last minute date changes, we had a different room that was little bit small."

1112193,90858651,2016-08-02,87154513,Quay,My Host ensured that I arrived at the house safely and that I had everything I needed. I was able to find my room with ease and everyone else were very friendly. The House is in walking distance of many food places.

Katie &Andrew made everything to make our trip as best as it can. Everything thing is said i think ! Amazing place, amazing Hosts, what else !!!!!!!  Nico and Claire"
994138,5820223,2013-07-17,7456801,Nicola,Nice people and nice location !
Pictures are really descriptive of what will be your room. It is exactly what you see. Actually you'll not get just a room,but you have opportunity to enjoy a private living room. Even if a dog is around,it will spend its time on upper floor and I've never heard during the night.,,,
Anyway,if you want,spending some time with Andrew & Katie is really amazing. They love travelling and will share their experiences.,,,
Room (and house in general) is very clean,and if you need something just ask and they will try to help you.,,,,
Very well organized,they have prepared a welcome kit,with a map,bus schedules,suggested restaurants,food store
Reaching airport requires to get bus,one stop of subway and change to silver line,but both changes have an elevator,so this isn't a big issue. Taxi ride should costs about 20$.,,
Neighborhood looks safe but I've never been outside late in the night.,,,,,
I'm a business traveler,"very used to spend my time in standard business hotels. I think that staying in a real house gives you the opportunity to understand a little more of how people really lives in a different country. This is my main reason to choosing airbnb instead of regular hotels.\"",,,,
994138,6081380,2013-07-29,7293626,Wahab,"Wonderful young couple, very accommodating with a beautiful house. Respectful to privacy, organized and clean.

994138,6664516,2013-08-20,6021550,Cindy,We highly recommend this place. The hosts are very hospitable. We stayed 3 nights in this flat and those nights were the best we had the US. There are bus stops (lines 7 & 9)  very close. You can easily reach the City center. The beach is 10 min by walk. The bed  is very comfortable.

Firstly,my apologies for this very late review ! Thank you for being such wonderful hosts during my trip in August.,,,,
Katie and Andrew are good easy going hosts. They communication and reservation process with them was efficient.,,,,,
Their place is centrally located. And the entire basement area is available instead of a single room. The lounge is a comfortable and welcome extra space to have. They were very helpful in every way - and very flexible about taking care of all extra requests.,,,,,
Our stay was very comfortable and I would certainly recommend their home.,,,,,
Last but not the least SAMMY - their absolutely adorable dog was the just as wonderful a host ! If you are fond of pets,then be warned you will get attached very quickly to Sammy.,,,,
wish you many good guests - and thanks for having us.,,,,,

We literally had the whole bottom floor to ourselves - there was a large bedroom with a super comfy bed,a bathroom full of everything you could ever need,and even a bar fridge and huge TV. We were almost overwhelmed by all the space!,,,
As for Katie and Andy - they are the sweetest and most welcoming couple. So easy to talk to and so easygoing. And Sammy the dog was (URL HIDDEN) gentle and loveable.,,,,,
The location was about 10 minutes drive from Boston CBD. It suited us just fine. The bus stop is about 2 minutes walk,and the subway is about 10 minutes walk. There's lots of restaurants nearby (we highly recommend the Lincoln),"and the town has a real community vibe. \"",,,
994138,7548570,2013-09-24,7240415,Joy,"What a sweet couple and perfect place to stay while in Boston!  I was in town for a conference and had a friend join me.  We loved having the lower floor all to ourselves and the space was great for relaxing at the end of the day.  The location is very close to the convention center and to two major bus lines.  We enjoyed lots of evening sightseeing and felt very safe the entire time.  Sammy (the dog) is so quiet and friendly, you will love her!

994138,11994394,2014-04-21,725100,Terri,"We had a great overnight stay at Katie's place. Nice set-up, comfortable bed and couch for our daughter. We didn't spend much time there, but it was comfy and private."
994138,12332287,2014-04-29,12164585,Reagan,"Andrew and Katie were great! They were both super friendly and accommodating. The place was perfect. You essentially get an entire floor to yourself with your own living room and TV so you can just relax after a full day of conferences and touring Boston.  Great location, great rates.  Would highly recommend!"
994138,12438841,2014-05-02,14132949,Alan,"It was a pleasure staying with Andrew and Katie. Everything was clean and comfortable, and good privacy. And the bed is comfortable and cozy.  Any dog lovers will feel especially at home as their very quiet and calm labradoodle Sammy is there to pet (but she also keeps to herself most of the time). The old S. Boston location is charming. I walked over to the Westin Waterfront every day for a conference (15 to 20 mins)."
994138,13003169,2014-05-17,9775634,Franzi,Me and my travel buddy's had a great time in Boston and as special because of this wonderful apartment. Andrew and Katie were very nice and friendly and open for every question we had. Everything was clean and comfortable.
Also,sammy (the dog) was a great host,too. A very calm dog and so open!,,,
The area around have a lot of restaurants etc and is to go to.,,,,,
"I would stay another time!\"",,,,,
994138,13529519,2014-05-30,4124782,Heather,"I had the pleasure of staying at Andrew and Katie’s house for almost a week.  I didn’t have the pleasure of meeting Katie but Andrew was very friendly and made me feel welcome the moment I arrived.  The space is clean and very comfortable, just as pictured.  They also went out of the way to put exact directions in “book” form to the bus and other local restaurants, which was great so I didn’t have to keep bothering him with a lot of questions.  I was in town for a convention and their home is a convenient 1 mile walk to the convention center and very close to the bus system.  I would highly recommend their home if you’re ever in Boston."
994138,13875654,2014-06-07,12341686,Alice,This accommodation was great. The bedroom was really comfortable and it was nice to have the private living room space to chill out at the start and end of the day. Andrew and Katie were great hosts and provided loads of written down local information which was really helpful. The area they live in is lovely and it's really easy to get to the city centre by bus. I recommend this place as a great stay.
994138,14034236,2014-06-10,15193472,Markus,"Actually there is nothing to add to all the other comments. Anyway, this accommodation was just fabulous. The bedroom was comfortable and you have an entire floor with living room, bath and fridge for your own. Everthing was as nice and clean as described and shown on the pictures. Andrew and Katie were really cool and gave us lots of helpful information. Their dog Sammy was the most lovely dogs, we've ever seen. The area is close to the city center, where you get with a 20 min. walk or a 3 min. taxi ride. We totally recommend this place and would stay there every time again."
994138,14247489,2014-06-15,16132013,Xiaotong,"We have stayed in Boston for three days and four nights. Andrew and Katie are nice and friendly. The rooms they prepared for us are cozy, clean and nice decorated. The neighborhood is good too with some nice restaurants and shopping market nearby. Also, Sammy is really cute and friendly. We definitely recommend it to other people."
994138,14368956,2014-06-17,16242010,Lindsay,"Great area, beautiful space and super nice hosts! Was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks, Andrew and Katie!"
994138,14533342,2014-06-21,10917180,Vince,"Fantastic spot, fantastic hosts. Andrew and Katie were very accommodating. It's hard to add to what has been said already. If you need a place to stay in South Boston, look no further."
994138,15451520,2014-07-09,717610,Laurel,"Andrew and Katie were great hosts!  They were flexible about our arrival time, which was a great help since we couldn't say exactly how long travel would take, etc.  They invited us to hang with them one evening, though we had other plans, and they were happy to chat and offer advice.  Their place is very nice and very clean, and the downstairs space was perfect for our group of 4.  We appreciated that there was a fridge downstairs for us to use.  The packet they left in the room included extensive public transit info, maps, and recommended restaurants and bars, which was very helpful.  We loved their dog Sammy -- the sweetest, gentlest dog we've ever met.  The location was good, in a nice neighborhood within walking distance of the beach and many places to eat.  We highly recommend a stay with Andrew and Katie!"
994138,15607929,2014-07-12,8908045,Ilde,"Our stay at Andrew and Katie's apartment was great. Communication and check-in was easy and effortless. Their home is definitely the right setup for hosting guests from AirBnB. The downstairs section of their home was completely for our use, which is large with it's own lounge area, bathroom and bedroom. We took the liberty of using their washer and dryer, which was such a help. The information booklet they put together was useful. Their home is in a neighbourhood in South Boston. While it is a residential area, it is a road or two away from restaurants, bars and public transportation (bus 7 and 9), so just a short bus trip away from South Station which gets you to downtown. Sammy, their dog, is adorable and so playful (but only when you initiate it). She is the only dog we have come across that does not bark and is just too sweet for words. Besides a good stay in their home, they were great hosts. We wish we had longer to stay and get to know them (over some beers) :)"
994138,16006737,2014-07-20,14722696,Carole,"Andrew & Katie were the perfect hosts. From the moment we entered their home, we were made to feel most welcome. Our accommodations were clean & spacious. We were given our privacy  but were encouraged to ask questions & engage in  conversation. Both Katie & Andrew had great ideas of places to see in Boston/Cape Cod/Cambridge. Highly recommended place to stay when visiting the Boston area. TIP: South Boston where this couple lives is well worth exploring BONUS: dog Sammy is a treat!!"
994138,16295682,2014-07-25,15124057,Kevin,"Andrew and Katie were extremely welcoming and helpful. They made our stay with them very easy. The accommodation is perfect, as advertised, with easy access to the sights of Boston via the bus and Metro. Sammy is the best mannered 2 year old dog we've ever met."
994138,16839779,2014-08-03,13108631,Pedro,"Andrew and Katie are such great hosts! They are really good at making the guests feel confortable and with autonomy. When I got there, they handled me a guide with all the info I needed: bus and subway infos, tips of stuff to do at Boston, and also good suggestions of restaurantes. With that in hands and a nice place to stay, I didn't need anything else. Not to mention Sammy, the nicest dog in town, I'm sure."
994138,17142990,2014-08-08,13309649,Yanjia,"First, the description on the listing page is accurate."
Second,the location is good. We went to Boston for a conference which took place in the BECE. This place is 20 minutes work or 10 minutes bus to the BECE.,,,,
Third,this neighborhood is good. We can easily find some cafe,restaurant,or supermarkets within walking distance.,,
Forth,"the hosts are nice. We especially love their dog -- Sammy. She is quiet and lovely. We spent some good time with her.\"",,,,
994138,17757238,2014-08-17,14556664,Simon,"Andrew & Katie were absolutely amazing hosts! They topped off my stay in Boston with the best accommodation and were extremely welcoming into their home. There is plenty of private space available, it is very clean, tidy and well kept. This is perfect if you are looking for a little bit of extra space to wind down after a busy day walking downtown Boston. There is also a large TV screen with HDMI cable available in the lounge area so we were able to watch plenty of movies before bed. Finally, what kind of review would this be if I didn't mention little Sammi? She is the most adorable and well behaved puppy. I would highly recommend staying with Andrew & Katie and will definitely be returning when I'm next in Boston. Thanks again for a great stay guys!"
994138,18668716,2014-08-30,19165778,Fabian,"Sehr gute Unterkunft die in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße liegt. Eine vielzahl von Shops, Bars und Restaurants sind nur ein bis zwei Straßen weiter, ebenso die Bushaltestellen."
Die Räume sind im Keller,denn man dann ganz für sich hat. Alles ist sehr sauber und neu. Im Schlafzimmer ist Platz für 2 Personen,weitere Personen schlafen auf dem großen Sofa.,,,
Andrew und Katie sind,obwohl wir sie nicht sehr oft zu Gesicht bekommen haben was aber an uns lag,wirklich sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Bei Anreise liegt eine kleine Zusammenfassung bereit,die das Wichtigste und auch ein paar gute Tipps enthält.,,
Danke für den angenehmen Aufenthalt.,,,,,

994138,19825763,2014-09-19,12551562,Victor,"Excellent experience.  Hosts were very nice, hospitable & accommodating.  They provided excellent dining suggestions close by and the location was an easy walk to my conference."
994138,20279195,2014-09-27,17718989,Don,The listing description was very accurate. Andrew and Katie couldn't have been more welcoming and solicitous about making sure I had what I needed. I had had one concern about the location being almost two miles from the Metro Center downtown where I needed to be. It ended up being a comfortable and site-entertaining 45 minute walk or an easy 10 minute ride on the #7 bus on Summer Street - very convenient (fare currently $2.10 each way). The bed was more comfortable than mine at home and the living room was large enough for me to spread out papers for my evening work. Wi-fi worked without a hitch. While I saw street repairs going on in the area it was very quiet on our street.
Two very good restaurants that I found close by on Broadway - Paramount and Cafe Porto Bella (best minestrone I've ever had at the Cafe).,,,,,
"I would definitely stay there again.\"",,,,,
994138,21134275,2014-10-12,20484313,Aprille,"We were made to feel most welcome and very well received. Our host are such wonderful folks who are proud  their neighborhood and their home. The photos are very true to the experience.  Except, the linens on the bed are so luxe a photo couldn't possibly capture it.  Also the wag on the tail of their pooch Sammie is so completely endearing along with the look of affection in her eyes. Getting around Boston was magic using the rides available with a smartphone. Local dining was scrumptious as suggested  by our hosts. Airnb hosts  Andrew, Katie & Sammie are considerate, resourceful and FUN! You will enjoy your stay in their cozy & comfy condo."
994138,21212991,2014-10-13,1182125,Ruth & Allan,"Andrew and Katie provide a great space for the weary traveler.  We had not only comfortable bedroom and bath, but also a T.V. lounge room which had a relaxing and cushy couch.  The location to Boston Logan Airport and downtown Boston can't be beat! We'd stay again if our travels ever take us back to Boston.  Ruth & Allan"

994138,22580533,2014-11-10,20615846,Yuri,I really enjoyed staying at this place. Katie and Andrew were very nice and made my stay easier. Their dog Sammy is very friendly and loved hanging out with her! The place is located in a convenient place and I had no problem going out to the downtown by using bus. Very easy access and found a good restaurant near the home as well.
994138,27643946,2015-03-09,553505,Ben,"Andrew and Katie were proactively communicative before our arrival, and flexible when our plans changed at the last minute. We really appreciated it. Also their dog is wonderful."
994138,28011946,2015-03-16,27326616,Meg,"We loved staying with Katie and Andrew! They were very quick to respond to our initial inquiries to get things set up. Their room was neat, spacious and quiet. It was perfect for what we needed. They were very welcoming and eager to help make our stay comfortable. Most of the activities we had planned for this trip were in the North End and along the Freedom Trail, so we didn't get to spend as much time as we would have liked in the immediate neighborhood where this listing is. But, there seemed like there was tons to do and lots of eating options. Transportation into the city from this area was really easy - there are several bus options you can take. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely want to stay here again on our next trip to Boston!"
994138,28342545,2015-03-22,22117800,Anthony,"We loved staying at Andrew and Katie's place. They were very quick to respond to our initial inquiry and throughout the booking process. Their home is located in a fairly quiet section of Boston, but it is very easy to get to anywhere you need to go! Their home is clean, spacious, and has everything you need to make your stay enjoyable (including a very handy guide to Boston!). Andrew was a great host, even opening up a beer with us when he learned we were beer fans. We can't recommend Andrew and Katie's place enough!"

Rooms were clean, well-maintained and comfortable.  The convention center was a 20 minute walk from the house.  The neighborhood was very quiet."
994138,30853929,2015-04-28,23456141,Cassie,"We had a great experience! The location is great- close to cute shops, bars and restaurants. We also loved being so close to the water, it made for beautiful runs in the morning. It's an easy cab ride/bus ride into downtown. The subway was about a mile from the house, but once you're there it's easy to get everywhere."
Katie and Andrew were wonderful hosts. Both were very friendly,welcoming and very informative about the city.,,,,
The room and main area were great. I slept on the couch which was actually really comfortable.,,,,,

Katie, Andrew, and Sammy(the pup) were all very welcoming and made themselves available to me if I ever needed something. Southie is also a great location. It is walking distance from shops, food, and the convention center. I definitely recommend their place!"

The apartment is exactly how it appears in pictures- very clean,spacious,and comfortable for 3-4 people. In addition,they have an air mattress available if needed.,,
They also had a K-cup machine and an electric kettle,which we didn't use,but it was nice to have the option of using.,,,
I would stay here again. Only drawback is that it is inconvenient if you don't have a car. And even if you do,"it may be hard to find parking depending on the time of day.\"",,,,

Their home is perfect for Airbnb with guests having their own space downstairs including bedroom,bath and den space. I was so impressed that they have toiletries available for use--praises for toothpaste since I didn't get to snag a travel container. We watched a lil' TV one night before bed and just really enjoyed our stay!,,,,

You really feel like you have your own space, which was great after long days in the city. Also, Southie (South Boston) is a perfect neighborhood to be in...great restaurants, bars, the beach, and easy access to public transportation.

I turned to Airbnb and I'm so lucky I found their listing - not only were they very fast to reply and accept the stay but they were very caring and helpful. My flight arrived in Boston late and they worked with me so that I could have access to their condo.
They have a BEAUTIFUL home! The guest room is downstairs with a private living room and bathroom. Everything was super clean and tidy. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were great. I loved the attention to little details in the bathroom as there was shampoo,conditioner,toothpaste,and other small toiletries in case you forgot to bring them.

994138,51276060,2015-10-19,39721409,Davida,This accomodation was in a clapboard house where we had the basement area and Andrew and Katie lived upsairs with Samie their very friendly dog. Katie had told us she and Andrew would not be around but the arrangements for the keys and getting in was touble free.
Katie and Andrew were very welcoming inviting us to use their fridge and kitchen if we wished. There was coffee and tea making facilities in our area with some nice touches like chocolates and mints. Andrew was always happy to give us recommendations and directions to wherever we wanted to go and always very helpful. The property was in a nice quite neighbourhood in South Boston a 15/20 minute bus ride from the centre of town. Katie and Andrew provided local maps and information so it was easy for us to find our way around. There was a very good diner only minutes away excellent for breakfast and a selection of restaurants nearby,none of which we tried,preferring to experience other locations.,,,
The nice thing about this property was that the guest area was self contained and spacious and also had a small fridge for our use. The bathroom was stocked with many toiletries  and there was always  plenty of hot water and ample towels.,,,,,
The bedroom was a relaxing room with nice bed linen although we did think the mattress was in need of some attention. Also it would have been nice to have some designated closet space. All cupboards contained their clothes and possessions and only a few hangers for any of our things.,,,,,
Overall this was  a posiive first AirB&B experience in a good location for exploring Boston.,,,,,

994138,51816156,2015-10-24,881066,Joseph,"Andrew and Katie were welcoming hosts. Their description of the place is accurate. Given how insanely expensive hotels were when I was in town (nearby hotel rooms were going for more than $500 per night), this place provided good value."
994138,52574528,2015-10-31,40085306,Daniel,Andrew and Katie are excellent hosts! This was my first time using Airbnb and I was definitely pleasantly surprised. The basement area was very clean and the accommodations were definitely more than enough for my colleague and me. We were there for a conference at the convention center and it was within walking distance (~ 20 min) from their place. they even provided a binder with suggestions about how to get around the city and where to go! I would definitely recommend their Airbnb listing to anyone visiting Boston!
994138,53115576,2015-11-05,37477666,Jen,"Andrew and Katie were great hosts and staying with them worked out just right for me, as I was in Boston for a conference at the Convention Center. I started my days early, and ended late, and that wasn't an issue at all."
There are also wonderful shops and eateries along East Broadway to enjoy... Their apartment is located in a great spot,and I found it all very walkable,"all the way to the Convention Center and the Seaport area.\"",,,
994138,59408107,2016-01-10,1968618,James & Lori,"What a terrific spot! Andrew and Katie are a lovely young couple - friendly, responsive, and easygoing - and they made the logistics of checking in easy. The space was perfect - comfortable, clean and well organized, with essentials like coffee/tea, shampoo/conditioner and hairdryer readily available. The neighborhood was also great, quiet but with coffee shops and excellent restaurants just a few blocks away - Andrew and Katie provided a handy guide with their recommendations (sushi place was delicious). I walked to the convention center each day and took public transportation one night when I had wandered further afield - bus dropped me off a block and a half away. Also, Sam is the sweetest dog ever. Highly recommended!"
994138,61836698,2016-02-08,3292098,Erin,My husband and I stayed at Katie and Andrew's for a long weekend. The apartment was great and basically like you had a private apartment. The coffee and beer was a wonderful touch.  We would stay here again for sure when visiting Boston
994138,66404429,2016-03-22,55958893,Bri,"Andrew and Katie were awesome! The place reminded me of a clip out of a HGTV magazine. Their home provided you with decent amount of privacy though I wish there was a door that separated downstairs from upstairs. Andrew and Katie stock the bathroom with your main necessities and also have a Keurig with K cups which was a pleasant surprise. We were also provided with a binder full of information on the city and Andrew was very helpful with information on Southie. Last but not least, Sammy was a sweetheart ❤️"
994138,67253969,2016-03-27,62182124,Brandon,"Andrew and Katie were great hosts for my 5 night stay in Boston. Check in was made very simple and I was welcomed  very warmly. The private room is exactly as shown and Andrew and Katie provide pretty much everything you need for a clean,comfortable, and private stay. There are a couple of places to get some pretty good food which are in walking distance of the listing. Andrew and Katie were open to answer any questions that I had and the guide of the Boston area that they provided was extremely helpful. I would highly recommend this listing, great stay!"
994138,69514127,2016-04-11,49939679,Shan,Andrew and Katie were absolutely great hosts and had a wonderful experience in the Boston area because of them! They were gracias and generous with their time and space and it made the stay all the better. The bed was large and ample lounge space in the living room. I would highly recommend this place to those who are touring the Boston area!
994138,71247897,2016-04-24,13582000,Victoria,"Andrew and Katie made us feel very welcome in their beautiful home!

It's also in a nice neighborhood with good places to eat."
994138,75075147,2016-05-18,7626822,Thierry,"Nice place. Andrew & Katie are friendly and easy-going hosts. I was there for business and could easily walk to the Convention Center. After work, it was great to relax there and enjoy a nice Bostonian neighborhood. Some good and friendly restaurants around. You can walk to the Dorchester Heights and enjoy its great view. But Andrew & Katie will be the ones to provide the best recommandations."
994138,75568999,2016-05-22,66178790,Andie,"I had a great first airbnb experience with Katie and Andrew. They are laid back, friendly, and responsive hosts. The room is very clean and comfortable. Their restaurant recommendations did not disappoint. The location is great; easy walk to the convention center and a pretty cheap uber ride from other parts of the city."
994138,81009265,2016-06-20,4688494,Jan,"My stay at Andrew and Katie's place was great. I was in Boston for a conference and their home is just a short bus ride or 15 min walk away from the BCEC. Very convenient! Also a nice neighbourhood. Communication with Andrew and Katie was very swift. They gave detailed instructions how to get to the apt and had tons of information about restaurants and things to do in Boston. They were very welcoming and easygoing. The guest area in their home is spacious and very clean. Everything was exactly as described! Overall, I can highly recommend staying with Andrew and Katie."

Despite having crummy weather, we were able to walk to the nearest T stop (in less than 30 minutes) and headed easily to a Red Sox game! Within the apartment, their private basement had everything we could need - our own bedroom, bathroom, and even a TV room (with a mini-fridge!). Thanks again for an awesome visit!"

There is free Parking on the street, but it was difficult to find any spaces.  That was never a problem because the landlord always let us use the driveway if we could not find any place on the street. The apartment was extremely clean and every room had an air conditioner which is a luxury in Boston. There was also a washer and dryer in the apartment.  There are two bedrooms and a full bath with a dining room and small living room. The apartment felt quite spacious for us. The one thing that might be an issue for some is that there is no tv.

We needed a place over the weekend, and Katia was able to arrange to have keys for us on our late arrival.  The Allston area is very tight on parking, but we were able to find parking right out front both days when we needed it.  The ride from the airport was also very brief, and we could walk the mile or take an uber to the T without much effort."

It is very cozy, clean and put together and she was very responsive and accomodating throughout the process. Everything in the apartment was clean and fresh. It was a little bit of a walk to get to public transportation and thus, quite a bit of travel to get to downtown. We didn't mind at all as we enjoyed exploring and are familiar with the area so could navigate well, but that might be an issue for older folks or anyone with children. The neighborhood was very nice and quiet and safe. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Boston area. Thanks for a lovely weekend, Katia!"

6728273,75065591,2016-05-18,43147178,Kwailin,"The place is spacious and sufficient.  Katia is very responsive to any queries and her landlord, Mark, is very helpful and kind to let us park in the driveway sometimes.  Parking can be challenging at night and weekends. Walking to the T is a walk (especially someone coming from Hawaii where everywhere is in reach by car), but good exercise. Overall we enjoyed our stay there.  I will stay there again but not having a rental car."
6728273,76453192,2016-05-27,63899310,Jozefien,"Everything was how it was described. It was perfect, spacious and Katia responds very quick. Neighbourhood is nice too, close to the beautiful harvard business school"

The first night we were there Katia's neighbor Mark invited us to an outdoor dinner party where we drank wine, ate delicious food and Mark even prepared a fantastic chocolate/bourbon cake that was out of this world! Katia was great! She readily responded to texts and even helped us find the right train when we got turned around in down town Boston!"
6728273,96084361,2016-08-21,30421116,Stephanie,This is an apartment on the 2nd floor. We stayed for a week and were very comfortable. It was homey place. Katya's communication was great and any questions I had were answered quickly. The neighborhood is nice. I had a car and found the parking easy. Grocery stores and Whole Foods are close by with a car. I highly recommend this apartment if the location works which it did for us.

Wir wurden sehr lieb willkommen geheißen, uns Tipps gegeben, was wir uns anschauen können und einen Reiseführer geliehen. Alles hat perfekt geklappt und die Wohnung war sauber und gemütlich.

Public transit was super close, yet we were tucked away on a small quiet street.  The small shops and restaurants really gave us a feel of authentic Boston.  The common roof deck was a major bonus too.  We were able to just order some take out and grab some wine for a fun roof top dinner one night.  The views made for some of my favorite vacation photos."
Adeline was an amazing host.  Everything was clean when we arrived.  She even left us a nice little note and a snack when we got in.  She was super flexible with times and helped us out with everything we needed.  A++ for hospitality.,,,,,

4279959,32313392,2015-05-17,25957022,Noel,My wife and I stayed for three nights and the apartment was charming and clean.  It is ideally located in the heart of U.S. history.  Walk outside and there’s a freedom trail.  End of the street is the Old North Church where Paul Revere hanged the lantern to warn Brits were coming.  Tons of restaurants to dine all in walking distance.  Subway station also located nearby to take you to Boston Museum of Arts etc.  We will recommend to anyone who enjoys history and loves to eat good food!
4279959,33300714,2015-05-26,5855998,Natalia,"Perfect Boston location on the Freedom Trail and in the vibrant North End neighborhood! We enjoyed being able to walk everywhere, including the South Station. The apartment is old, but generally clean and comfortable, and stays cool inside on a hot day. The views from the rooftop are spectacular. However, the deck is a work in progress after a fire, so not conducive to hanging out for a long time."
"Communication with Adeline was timely and seamless. She promptly answered any questions we had. We also appreciated having coffee and milk available in the morning. \"",,,,,

She was very responsive to my initial request, helped sort out how to get the keys mid-day the first day, and stopped by to make sure we were settled. She left a note with information and recommendations of places to eat in the area. Her apartment is as it is advertised in that it is her personal apartment, so there isn't a lot of extra space for your belongings. However, it was very livable for the week and she made extra touches with toiletries available and access to her wi-fi. Also, it is in a great location in the North End with easy access to so much!"

Parking is a bit tricky the easiest way is to pay for parking in the nearby parking lots. We highly recommend."
4279959,49809041,2015-10-06,466731,Nancy,"North End is a great location. It's an old, historical neighborhood full of delight, but it also unfortunately has narrow streets with no alleys (meaning all the shops and apartment buildings have to leave their garbage on the sidewalk). During the day, there are a lot of visitors that come to check out a nearby historical church and its adjacent burial grounds and it can be a little crowded there. The area is fairly quiet in the evening, but you can sometimes hear people chatting outside since the walls are thin. The apartment building itself appears to be very old. This spot is very close to a few T stops, such as Haymarket and North Station. It's really good if you want to be able to go sight seeing and grab a bite to eat when you return (lots of excellent restaurants close by). Adeline was extremely accommodating and flexible with our check in and check out times."

For a visit in Boston, the North End is perfectly located, there is no need to take the car to go somewhere.  Adeline was very quick to answer our questions.

We tried everything on her list. The apartment is cozy and sweet. I felt at home the second day I stayed there. The North End is full of Italian everything and the street are so cozy and everything is in walking distance. Even Boston itself is mainly a walk away. The city is basically 2 miles and my girlfriend and I found ourselves all over town, and trust me she hates walking. Ubers late at night to go home or go over to Harvard and MIT weren't bad at all. 5-9 dollars depending on traffic. Everything about this place and the city was perfect. Would definitely recommend it. The view of the city from the roof alone is worth a trip back. Thanks Adeline!"

When I arrived she had a note waiting for me with the wifi password and other things I might need.  The apartment was perfect for what I was looking for, and is in a very nice area of town right next to the freedom trail.  It's not some high-end place, as it is in an old area of town, but especially for the cost, it was perfect for my needs!"

The location is unbeatable, right on the Freedom Trail at the North End,  with plenty of restaurants around. Adeline was very flexible with our check in and check out times, which was very convenient to us since our flight left in the afternoon and we didn't have to rush out and still got to enjoy the city in the morning."
The house is a charming old Bostonian house,so don't expect any luxuries,but perfect for 1 or 2 people. Believe me,I have stayed in the North End before and the houses were half as nice. Adeline lives there so it can feel a bit cluttered not knowing where to put your stuff,but this shouldn't be a problem,just know it's not a hotel like airbnb.
Towels,"toiletries and hairdryer were all provided. The rooftop was great although we couldn't enjoy it too much because it was raining...\"",,,,

The apt is very well located in the \"\"little italy\"\" of the North End among many great restaurants"

I flew in from the southwest to meet him as well. The hotels in the area were overbooked, and exceedingly expensive. After multiple tries, I was starting to lose faith in AirBNB as well, because we were declined repeatedly for other apartments in the area.  The YMCA was starting to look pretty good when Seamless contacted me via email, and provided access to a perfect two room apartment in a great neighborhood.  Again, very grateful! The room was perfect."
4021522,30807733,2015-04-27,746418,Arjun,"Excellent experience all the way from the check-in experience, terrific views of Boston, clean apartment and even a welcome package!! Highly recommended!!"
4021522,36308401,2015-06-27,13004827,Sven,"Great apartment, in a very modern and nice building. Perfectly located to explore Boston. We stayed for one week with two children. The apartment was perfect for the four of us. Everyone liked to pool, gym and BBQ. Chinatown is just next doors for meals and shopping. Pretty much all central Boston neighbourhoods can be reached on foot. Highly recommended."
4021522,43254247,2015-08-18,12731813,Jackie,"Wonderful apartment! Check-in and check-out very easily. We stayed for four week with one kid and one baby. The apartment was perfect for us. Downtown, Chinatown and T are all close to it. The staff at the front desk was very nice and helpful. Very kind community. Definitely will stay here again."
4021522,45809212,2015-09-06,38713694,Helen,"We were delighted with this apartment. Great location just off Boston Common and close to the T. Coffee shop downstairs and close to other retail outlets and restaurants. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. The facilities including the lounge and gym were really great. The concierge staff were helpful and always friendly. An absolute pleasure to stay there, won't hesitate to book this again."
4021522,68906737,2016-04-07,15363149,Andrew,"Host was extremely helpful, gave me all info required in run up to visit.  Fantastic location and really high quality."
750438,4964704,2013-06-04,5448841,Andrew,"Lisa has a nice little spot in JP, an easy stroll from the orange line, green street stop.  My girlfriend and I stayed here while we were waiting to move into our new home two blocks away!  Everyone in the house was friendly and accommodating.  I say everyone because it can be quite crowded (some nights there were 8 people staying and only one bathroom).  Overall, I think the location and atmosphere is a great value for a unique stay in Jamaica Plain."
750438,7949725,2013-10-09,6407804,Sarah,"This was such a delightful stay! Lisa is a fantastic host. The room itself was wonderful- bright and cheery, and Lisa was kind enough to think of all the little things that really make a visit just right: real bedding, emergency toiletries, and towels on hand and information on the area. (Towels and real bedding, folks. It's always the little touches.) I enjoyed talking to everyone in the house, and JP is just an amazing neighborhood- I can't stop thinking about it. I'd definitely come back. Thanks for a terrific stay!"
750438,8154470,2013-10-18,1338266,Daniel,lisa was welcoming & fun. the room cosy & clean. 2 friendly cats & a housemate complete the picture. i was made to feel at home immediately. centre street is 2 blocks away & the Orange Line is a 5 minute walk. parking is free & not hard to find. would definitely return on future trips.
750438,8240598,2013-10-21,8706371,Carmel,"Lisa's place is indeed a quiet, leafy oasis in a gorgeous spot in Boston. While it's nearly at the end of one of the subway lines it's close to everything. Lisa is ready to have a chat, if you need, after a hard day of being a tourist. I really enjoyed my stay."
750438,8873722,2013-11-23,1831180,Ken,"I had a great time staying at Lisa's. The place is very cozy and beautiful. The pictures certainly don't do it justice. The room is very clean. The bed is very comfortable and there are extra blankets if needed. The bathroom is shared between a few people, so there may be a queue in the morning. Lisa is very welcoming and always available to help. The two cats are very cool and friendly."
The area is very lively with its own community culture,separate from Boston proper. There are some great restaurants,cafes,and markets for organic food. The nearby pond is very beautiful and poetic on a fall afternoon. The Midway Cafe is a great venue for local music,ranging from indie,to folk
While it's a bit of a hassle for daily commute to Boston and Cambridge. I highlight recommend Lisa's place for a staycation. JP's community makes a wonderful retreat from the busy city life,"without the ridiculous travel.\"",,,,
750438,11562310,2014-04-07,13347553,Todd,"If you are going to Boston, book this room NOW - it will change a small part of your life (for real)."
My son and I had a wonderful time in Boston exploring history and just hanging out together. We did many things that we have never done or experienced.,,,,,
Aside from spending time with my son,the most rewarding part of this trip was meeting Lisa and John. I never imagined staying in a stranger’s house like that,but what a great time and although we didn’t hang out all the time,the time we did was nice and sure helped us out in our journeys as well. I am sure there are other nice folks on AirBnB,but I can’t fathom none as sweet and accommodating as Lisa.,
We started to get acquainted from the airport ride back to her place and it lasted our entire stay. She gave us a key to the house,a tour of the place and immediately went through our list of attractions 'to visit or not to visit' (as that WAS the question). We felt at home and came and went as we wanted. Her place is in a great location and you feel safe. You can walk to downtown Jamaica Plain and spend the entire day and night visiting shops and pubs and/or then take a seven minute stroll to the Orange line and in 15 minutes and four or five subway stops you are smack downtown Boston.,,,,
There were so many perfect things about this trip and the accommodations were one of the best! The room is on the smaller side,so if you are traveling with someone,be on good terms with them. But do NOT let that be a deciding factor - Lisa is legit and I hope my travels take me back.,,,
I could go on,but only allowed 500 words. Bottom line - if you are going to Boston this is the place you better be booking ASAP!,,,,
"Thanks again Lisa!\"",,,,,
750438,11820371,2014-04-15,13924460,Christopher,Lisa guided us to her house by phone and made us welcome from the moment we parked outside. The house was clean comfortable and ideally placed for easy access to the whole Boston area by public transport.
"We will definitely try to stay with Lisa if we visit Boston again.\"",,,,,

Lisa (und John) waren wundervolle Gastgeber - immer hilfreich, wenn es um Tipps für die Ausflüge ging, und angenehm zurückhaltend, wenn man \"\"seine Ruhe\"\" wollte. Ein zwar kleines Gästezimmer"
Absolutely wonderful experience. Thank you,"Lisa and John!\"",,,,

We apreciate her warm wellcome very much. Everything was need, clean and cosy and we have had some very interesting talks. Next time in Boston means next time at Lisa`s!"
750438,12316868,2014-04-28,13964913,Sophie,"Lisa (and John!) are simply the best hosts you could ask for. They are approachable, friendly, hip, and just like their house, full of life and character. They are always available for anything you need, but are also respectful and understanding if you want your space. We needed to extend our stay unexpectedly and Lisa welcomed us back without a moment's hesitation. The room is lovely and sunny, exactly what you need and the Toblerone, wine, and bottle of Pellegrino were an awesome bonus :) It was my first Air B&B experience and I could not speak more highly of these good-to-the-bones folks or the almighty Creamsicle!"
750438,13013907,2014-05-17,10156530,David,"We had the pleasure to stay at Lisa’s wonderful home for a couple of days. We absolutely loved the area! Jamaica Plains has a different vibe than the other places in Boston we’ve been, it’s very relaxed and very, very green! The arboretum (very close) must be the prettiest park in Boston (or the country). Lisa’s house has a big garden, and surrounding houses as well. Looking out the window it almost seems you’re somewhere in the countryside. I had to work a bit, which I did at a nice coffee place nearby, or on the couch on the porch. There’s plenty of nice restaurants, stores, bakeries, etc. nearby, Lisa has tons of good suggestions. The hat-store is absolutely amazing! Lisa herself is very kind, helpful and just a wonderful host. The only thing I can think of that could be improved is the water pressure on the shower. We can highly recommend staying at her place."
750438,13148869,2014-05-20,14483167,Audrey,"Lisa and John were perfect and lovely hosts, very helpful and generous! It was our first experience with AirBnB and not our last one! Thank you for everything, we really enjoy our stay in Boston and surely return soon! We definitely recommend this charming place!"
750438,13690938,2014-06-02,15311432,Deb,"I feel like the best feedback I can give is that on my next trip to Boston, I would  stay here again.  The room is small and sweet.  The house quiet and surrounded by trees and comes with two gentle cats.  JP is a great part of Boston with a diverse population and a pond to run around (almost exactly 3 miles from this house) that is a nice break from work meetings all day in the city.  Lisa is a great host--kind, funny, and is the type who will invite you to dinner but not be annoyed if you say no.  It was a nice change from staying in a sterile hotel room."
750438,15265547,2014-07-06,6796845,Daniel,"Lisa's apartment is quaintly wonderful. She was a away during our two day stay, but made sure our needs were completely catered for, right down to chocolates and healthy breakfast provisions."
I'd never heard of the neighbourhood of Jamaica Plains,but it has historical significance as well as being modestly hip. The area has an 'emerald necklace of parks' that gives access to peaceful strolls in a nature setting. If you like cats as I do,you'll find Lisa's two furry creatures undemanding,"friendly companions during your stay in this charming accommodation.\"",,
750438,15838643,2014-07-16,17351314,Micki,"Our hostess was wonderful. Very down-to-earth and accommodating. We had a little miscommunication on the first day of our arrival, but she graciously comped us a night and quickly righted things. She has two lovely, sweet cats and a very friendly significant other! The neighborhood was awesome. We loved Jamaica Plain. It's a quirky, up-and-coming area with a lot of character. Overall, we highly enjoyed our stay."
750438,16517352,2014-07-28,13140629,Lisa,"I spent  three days last weekend at this airbnb, and let me mention, every word that the hostess says about her self and her place, and every word"
in the first ten reviews ( which I read) is true...this is a lovely,comfortable,welcoming place,with a host who truly makes every effort to make you feel at home. It is VERY convenient to public transportation to the center of Boston by subway or bus,VERY convenient to the main commercial vein of Jamaica Plain with its interesting restaurants and shops(on which you will get great advice from the hostess). If you love gardens,oh my
You really cant go wrong with this Air BnB.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
750438,16730677,2014-08-01,17654572,Andrew,"Boston is an unbelievable city and having a quiet room, close to transportation and other amenities was a definite bonus. Lisa and John are both great hosts full of insight and useful tips for getting the most of their trip. Me and a friend stayed with them for three nights and could not have been happier with their hospitality and the room they provided. It can be a little tight for two adults to share the bed, but it was perfect for the two of us who only needed a place to crash when we came back from an eventful day."
We really wish we had more time to explore Boston and use a lot of the suggestions Lisa had given us for things to do. All the things she suggested that we did manage to get to were exceptional (got to Mike's Pastry and get the canolis!!!). Boston is a very friendly city with great paths for walking and biking,a solid transportation system,and SO many different and unique things to do. With Lisa as your guide,"the only thing you be left wanting is more time!\"",,

The cats are in the house,but not in the room. The room has two huge spectacular windows that not only offers a beautiful view,"but a cool breeze during summer time. We highly recommend Lisa's place!!\"",,,
750438,17863145,2014-08-18,398180,Mélissa Et Damien,"Notre séjour a JP a été très agréable : lisa est une hôte accueillante et attentive, sa maison est très belle avec son jardin et sa grande cuisine, la rue est calme et toute l'activité de JP est a 5 minutes a pied. Le métro (ligne orange) est a 10 mn ce qui permet d'être dans le centre en 30 mn. On a adoré boston !!!"
750438,18745585,2014-08-31,17806725,Jelle,"Staying at Lisa and John's place was amazing! The neighborhood is great, green, quiet, safe, and easy to reach by public transport. Unfortunately, we didn't meet Lisa, but John was there to let us in. John also made sure we had everything we needed, like some cereal the first morning, fresh towels and linen, free organic tomatoes and zucchini's fresh from the garden, even though he had a pretty busy week at work. Apart from that, John is also a really nice host, with lots of interesting stories and tips on what to do while in Boston. We had some great conversations, while the two easy going cats were lazily hanging around."
We (my SO and I) had a great week here,"and would definitely recommend it to anyone planning to visit Boston! \"",,,,
750438,18954239,2014-09-03,14532567,Florian,Lisa and John's place has a very friendly atmosphere and we enjoyed staying there. We just got to meet John and he took good care of us. It was a very relaxed stay in a really nice neighborhood. Jamaica Plain was one of our Boston highlights :-)

750438,19324015,2014-09-10,19025248,Karin,I spent 4 days at this nice and quiet house. Due to the hospitality and the easy-going attitude of Lisa and John I immediately felt at home. The tomatoes of Lisa's garden were gorgeous! I can recommend this place.
750438,19447946,2014-09-12,5979801,Jörn,We had a very warm welcome. Lisa is a great host. Try to pick her brain if you get the chance. Would stay here again.

750438,19700385,2014-09-16,13070724,Beth,"Lisa was amazing!   She was welcoming and ready to answer any questions.  I was thankful she picked us up from the T so we didn't get lost on arrival.   Her neighborhood was wonderful and an easy walk to the T.  She was happy to hold our luggage as we had an early arrival and late departure, so we could make the most our time.  I appreciated having coffee available and an extra treat of trying zucchini/ almond muffins for the first time.  I highly recommend this home for your stay in Boston."
750438,19805595,2014-09-18,1283800,Lukas,"Staying with Lisa was lovely and I felt immediately welcomed. She's obviously a well established host, knowing how to make you feel at home. She and John were both very forthcoming in helping me with the myriad of questions I had about the area, since I'm planning to move to JP myself."
The room is cozy and quiet,the mornings are serene and the whole day felt I was welcomed to come in and out as I wished.,,,,
"The area of Lisa's house is one of the best in JP; it's a bit more hilly than the other places which gives it a nice flair.\"",,,,,

750438,20514314,2014-09-30,2045080,Devesh,This was the best AirBnb I have stayed in until now.
I had a lovely stay at Lisa and John’s place. Both of them were very friendly and accommodating.,,,,,
Their place was clean and very well furnished. My room had three large shelves/closets and lots of light. I hung out mostly in the living room area downstairs or in their lovely Kitchen. It was like staying in a home away from home.,,,,,
Lisa even provides her guests a spare fridge to keep their stuff — which I made good use of during the time. She provided lots of pillows and towels. There are lots of dishes to use and the kitchen feels inviting to cook at. The bathroom was very clean,,,,,
She grows awesome homegrown tomatoes (among other things) and I was lucky enough to try them on a couple of occasions.,,,,,
Their home is next to the Green street orange line station,so it was easy to get to anywhere. Its next to a nice park and was reasonably quiet. I felt quiet safe returning home late in the night.,,,,
The two cats are great: They are friendly,want to be petted and generally mind their own business.,,,,
I am definitely shortlisting this for my next trip to Boston.,,,,,

The room was clean and welcoming with chocolates and sparkling water waiting for us bedside. They provided plenty of towels for our use and even had a basket full of toiletries in case we forgot anything. Having a separate refrigerator was also a nice touch. The neighborhood was safe and cute and Lisa gave us some awesome recommendations for local finds. Our only complaint, which is minimal due to it being out of the hosts control, is that because it was an old house, noise carried and we could hear everything from our room. We're heavy sleepers so this wasn't really a big issue for us, but something we definitely noticed. All in all though, we had a lovely time and would highly recommend this AirBnB to others!"
750438,22309540,2014-11-03,1790660,Mario,"We stayed at Lisa's place for almost a week and we loved the place. Lisa was an excellent host, very welcoming and helpful (she gave us a lot of advices regarding Boston)."
The room was really nice and clean,so was the bathroom. We were able to use kitchen to make lunches/dinners and tea.,,,,
The apartment location is in beautiful Jamaica Plain neighbourhood just a couple of minutes to subway station that is connected to centre of the city with very regular metro lines (less than 30 minutes to the centre of the city). It's easy to find stores,bars and some pubs in the area,as well as really nice Harvard arboretum.,,,

750438,32679078,2015-05-20,28317811,Dwo,My girlfriend and I stayed at Lisa’a place for our 1st ever Airbnb stay and we couldn’t have been more pleased. Our flight was delayed so we didn’t get into Lisa’s place until past 3 am but she was able to accommodate our schedule to let us in. Her place is located in a quiet part of town and conveniently located next to a T stop as well as the Samuel Adams brewery (about 10 minute walk each).
Despite having 2 well-behaved cats,we found her place to be immaculate and the bed very comfortable to sleep on. She provided us with toiletries,towels,"and even chocolate. Lisa and her partner John make for excellent company as they are very easy to talk to. We certainly hope that all our future Airbnb hosts can be as accommodating and friendly as Lisa and John.\"",,

The two house cats were definitely a perk:) My best friend &i spent three nights in JP and Lisa's home is an easy, safe 3-minute walk to the T. My only hesitation would be two people trying to share the downstairs bedroom.... it was quite cramped for us with our belongings and the layout of the room. However, it would probably be perfect for those traveling lightly or someone seeking an intimate space! I would definitely return to her abode!"

We were given our own space but she was very hospitable and helpful while around and very friendly. We needed to arrive late and Lisa was able to accommodate us.

750438,36031132,2015-06-24,18927150,Terrence,My wife and I stayed in Lisa's Jamaica Plain oasis for two weeks. We LOVED it. We never felt unwelcome or crowded. She and her husband were also extremely nice to my wife when she had to stay in Boston for the first few days without me.
Our room was extremely comfortable,with two huge windows looking out into the lush foliage of JP. When it rained one morning,the sound of the drops on the leaves was heavenly. The house is close to public transportation so we were always able to get around.,,,
The neighborhood is very green,"filled with big trees and grassy parks. And fantastic restaurants. I will be moving to Boston soon and Jamaica Plain is now at the top of my list of candidate neighborhoods.\"",,,,
750438,36712019,2015-06-30,26185731,Ashleigh,Lisa was an incredible host. She was very easy to communicate with and answered all our questions. She is so laid back and easygoing which made us feel at home and comfortable during our short stay.
The kitchen is great for cooking with everything you need. She had a great collection of spices and tea.,,,,,
I can't forget to mention her beautiful fruit trees. She let us freely pick as many tart cherries as we wanted.,,,,,
All in all,we enjoyed our brief stay in Jamaica Plain with Lisa and John. They were very easy to get along with. We would definitely stay here again.,,,,

Lisa's Haus findet sich in einem ruhigen Vorort von Boston mit sehr netter Nachbarschaft, wodurch man sehr schnell authentisches Bostoner Wohnen spürbar wird. Die Innenstadt von Boston ist sehr einfach über die Subway (Line Orange) erreichbar. Das Haus von Lisa ist klein, aber fein! - sehr liebevoll eingerichtet, wodurch man sich gleich wohlfühlt. Besonders nett waren die Gespräche mit Lisa bei einem Frühstückskaffee, wo sie uns vieles über und rund um Boston, aber auch die USA berichten konnte. Vor allem aber haben wir auch ihre beiden zutraulichen Hauskatzen sehr schnell in unser Herz geschlossen :-). Alles war sehr sauber, der Umgang miteinander war sehr offen und unkompliziert. Wir haben uns rundum wohl gefühlt und kommen bei Gelegenheit gerne wieder mal zurück."

750438,38645298,2015-07-17,16887144,Sandra,"We had a great time at Lisa’s Place. The place is beautiful and Lisa and John are very nice. The location in Jamaica Plain is very good. The neighborhood is very nice, quiet and green. There are nice places to eat out in Jamaica plain and Downtown Boston is very close and easily reachable via Subway."
"Make sure to eat a Burger at „Grassfed JP“ in Jamaica Plain – one of the best burgers. \"",,,,,
750438,40144643,2015-07-28,29711282,Jean-Philippe,Lovely place. Lisa and John are very welcoming and helpfull. We also enjoyed the Jamaica Plain area.

750438,43273620,2015-08-18,38798353,Josée,"Beautiful, peaceful and safe neighborhood, very kind and friendly hosts, and a cosy house that make a great home away from home. Easy access to the T that makes it easy to go anywhere in the city. First experience with Airbnb but definitely not the last. Thanks Lisa and John, we had an amazing time in Boston!"
750438,45316482,2015-09-01,36437667,Diego,Very cozy home in excellent location! JP is a very cool neighborhood.
Everything looks like in the pictures. Lisa and John are very nice people and easy to get along with. I really enjoyed my stay,"I truly recommend this place. :) \"",,,,
750438,46635354,2015-09-12,41310433,Alex,"We had a great experience at Lisa's and John's place, which was very easy to find thanks to the detailed explanation. Both hosts were very kind and made sure we did not lack a thing. The room itself was not very large, but since we spent most of the time downtown, that did not really matter. When it was raining and we were too tired to leave, the porch and the living rooms invited us to spend a lazy afternoon reading in what almost felt like an indoor garden."
750438,48024478,2015-09-22,4678432,Marie,We had a very good time at Lisa's house. She and her boyfriend welcomed us very nicely. The house is beautiful and the neighborhood very quiet and close to the center at the same time. Thank you Lisa!

Lisa gave great directions and provided perfect info leading up to our trip,and was very easy to get a hold of if we had any questions!,,,,
She made us feel right at home right away,and Lisa & John were nice to talk to!  Everything was ready when we arrived,and really were a significant part of a great trip!  Would definitely come back the next time we are in the city,and would recommend Lisa's house to anybody visiting Boston/Jamaica Plain!,,

750438,49502439,2015-10-04,3093797,Daniel,"Lisa and Lisa's place are great. From the very beginning, Lisa was extremely responsive and helpful. The place is in a great location, and it is very clean, comfortable and safe. Lisa is around to help with anything you need and she is very accommodating. We definitely recommend it!"
750438,50673288,2015-10-13,17359588,Attila,"My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights at Lisa's lovely home. Lisa, John and their 2 cats were very welcoming and made us feel at home. They gave us great suggestions on what to do in the neighborhood and in Boston. Jamaica Plain is a peaceful neighborhood with beautiful old houses and great little cafes and restaurants. The house is short walking distance from the subway and two blocks away from a bus to downtown. The room and the house were very clean and everything was as in the detailed description."
750438,51114716,2015-10-18,2196637,Cristina,"Lisa was very accommodating. Her house is charming and the room was comfortable. Space is a little tight, but that's New England for you! I'm not going to hold Lisa responsible for that! Lisa's pets are very cute and friendly. There is a faint parfum de chat, but nothing so intense you can't forget about it. Lisa's home is single-handedly saving the environment and she provides a list of how you can help ensure that this continues while staying with her. I didn't see her much, but she was super great with communication. I would certainly recommend and stay again myself."
750438,52359036,2015-10-28,9085770,Jacob,"We had a great stay here with Lisa and John and can highly recommend this listing. We were made to feel very welcome and the place felt just like home. It's a short walk to the bars and restaurants of Jamaica Plain and close to the train which takes you downtown in 15 minutes or so. The street itself is quiet and green. It's all in all a wonderful place to stay, and we felt very fortunate to meet these great hosts and explore this little corner of Boston. JP itself has so much to offer! Can recommend JP Seafood Cafe, Fomu, Canto6 Bakery and Grassfed Burgers."
750438,53543034,2015-11-09,3533097,Lani,"We truly enjoyed our stay at Lisa's home. Both Lisa & John were friendly and considerate hosts, and the neighborhood was charming. The place itself was clean and very inviting. We also loved the cats! Thank you, Lisa and John, for a pleasant stay in Boston!"
750438,56948061,2015-12-20,39952290,Haley,"My partner and I stayed with Lisa for two nights in funky JP. Her space is cozy and very welcoming, exactly as described. We were able to walk to everything in the area and check out all that JP has to offer. Lisa has an exceptional tea shelf which helped to warm us up from the December cold! We we're able to gain great suggestions on food/shopping/travel from herself and friends. We will be sure to come back to explore some more come summer! Thanks Lisa!!"
750438,57803143,2015-12-29,37922266,Rita,Lisa and John are great hosts. The house is nice and there are two cute cats living with us. The location is great. Close to orange line. Neighborhood is nice and quiet. Will definitely stay there again next time in Boston.
750438,59923154,2016-01-17,2960044,Mary,"Lisa and John were such lovely, good-hearted people. I can't say enough how they made me feel right at home. I stayed there for a week while looking for apartments. There were a few special favors I needed to request of them that would've been completely within their rights to decline, but they went above and beyond to welcome me to the great city of Boston (free computer charging service! Haha). I would definitely recommend a friend to stay with them."
The location is a very easy walk to public transportation and restaurants etc. Jamaica plain is a beautiful,quiet town with a lot of personality.,,,,
It took one flight of stairs to get to my room,and they had everything I needed to feel comfortable- toiletries,towels,dresser. I especially liked the lights directly over the bed :) The bed was good,and that's saying a lot since I have a really bad back and rarely can sleep on a bed that's not mine.,
The bathroom is shared and I never had to wait more than a minute to use it. The cats do tend to like to sneak into your room if you don't keep it closed,which I found adorable :) but it is something to be aware of.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
750438,62760004,2016-02-16,56828501,Christian F.,I've rented for 1 week and then I came back for 3 extra days because the experience was completely good.
Some highlights:,,,,,
Despite I've visited this home on Winter,inside I really felt like it was Spring or even Summer. Lisa's happiness and hospitality is incomparable.,,,,
You have your own space (fridge/dorm/washing center) but if you want you can talk with hosts at the kitchen or living room. There's always somebody at home,so you can start a conversation. This helped me a lot,because I want to improve my english skills  (I speak spanish) and Lisa even speaks spanish.,,,
Lisa cooks great things and has chic teas that can share with you!,,,,,
By the side,the neighborhood is quiet and near (5 min) to great spots in Jamaica Plain.  From Green St. takes 15 min to Downtown.,,,,
I'm looking forward to comeback someday :),,,,,
"101% Recommendable. \"",,,,,
750438,63136039,2016-02-20,21375830,Rebecca,"We were greeted by Lisa & John later in the evening and as we walked through the house, I knew we would be in for a treat once the morning sun rose, with the beautiful, vibrant colors and big windows. We were also given plenty of pointers for our sort of impromptu trip to Boston and were pleased to walk around the JP area and find so many cool spots. Best part, after our tiring adventures, we were able to come home to Lisa's comfy house and hang with the sweet cats."
750438,64169521,2016-02-29,47261647,Katie,"Lisa and John were very welcoming and friendly. It felt private and there was plenty of space, even though you share a bathroom and living area. It is also very close to a train that takes you to the city in about 20 minutes. Its definitely a great deal if you are looking to visit Boston on a budget!"
750438,64911367,2016-03-09,5159344,Maria,Lisa was every bit of the nicest and most welcoming that I thought she would be . Such a charming place filled with lots of character . Walkable to the T and to some hot spots in town . Amazing all around ! Would definitely recommend !!!
750438,65252021,2016-03-12,55937151,Andrew,My boyfriend and I recently took our first trip to Boston. We wanted to make sure that our host was gay friendly and that it was a chill environment.  Lisa and John were excellent hosts. They were extremely friendly and went out of their way to be accommodating to our needs. They always had plenty of ideas and new places for us to try. The rules were extremely lax and it was easy to get along with both of them.  We would both like to stay with Lisa and John in the future. I highly recommend them!
750438,67673749,2016-03-30,62075008,Oleg,"Lisa and John were awesome hosts, and I am very sorry not to have enough time to know them better.

Both my parents are very happy to have made great friends with Lisa. The house and room were very well kept. She openheartedly offered her kitchen for use. The neighborhood was like a cherry on the icing. The most beautiful neighborhood in Boston with the Jamaica pond just a small walk away. My parents would love to live at Lisa's house again, the next time they visit."

The room is comfortable for sleeping, has TV and most important a WiFi hook up. Our visit was to attend events at a local university so we hardly spent daylight time at Lisa's. Hot coffee was ready in the morning.We have friends living close by, the reason for JP site."

It is a warm, inviting home (complete with two sweet kitties) where we immediately felt comfortable. The place is nestled behind a front garden and feels secluded enough, yet very close to the main strip. It is also a 5 minute walk from the train. Would definitely stay here again!"

Nevertheless we weren't able to get in the house, because another guest had taken the key. Although having stayed for two nights we never saw our host and she didn't respond to emails anymore. There were another three guests in the house."
Communications and organization in case of absence have to be worked on. :-),,,,,

I liked my room but I felt it needed to be lit more like other rooms on the second floor which I liked more but unfortunately weren't available . The house was close to south station but it took longer to get to downtown about 30-45 minutes . But it didn't create a major problem and it wouldn't be by car . It took 15 minutes to get to downtown by car . Jessica is a very interesting person and she was very helpful . She even helped me write an important letter thank you Jessica it was pleasure meeting you :)"

Jessica was fantastic,taking time from a busy schedule to show me around and give tips on where to go,what to do and where to eat,so I always had an idea of what I could do and where to go.,,
"All in all a great hassle free stay :).\"",,,,,
3344322,34240545,2015-06-06,34116185,Tamara,"I was at Jessica's for a full week, while driving all around eastern Mass, suburbs of Boston, to the cape, and to Providence for various appointments. Her house, warm and beautifully cluttered as she and the pictures indicate, is wonderfully located for using a car.  Easy to get on all the key highways and easy to drive downtown if you need to (I did and it's less than a 10 minute drive).  Very close the JFK museum and UMB; really located well for any direction.  Easy walk to the T and easy rides to the Commons, Newbury Street, etc.  I always easily found free street parking within a few houses of hers and could leave the car there when I used public transportation.  Safe, friendly neighborhood - no worries.  And Jessica is super nice.  She provides great written information about the T, nearby restaurants and activities - very helpful.  This was my first Airbnb and I am hooked!  Will likely be bringing my husband, teen son and elderly mother to Boston next year for a graduation, and I hope we can rent out all her second floor rooms.  I highly recommend Jessica's home."
3344322,37411590,2015-07-06,11763918,Alyssa,"The house (and the room we stayed in) was clean and colorful with lovely painting hanging everywhere. I was very happy to find an air conditioning unit. Off the bat, Jessica told us all about the nearby museums and interesting places, which was great because we had never been to Boston before. The neighborhood was very nice. The walk to the train is about 10 minutes, which isn't so bad. It only took about 10 minutes more to reach downtown."
3344322,38729748,2015-07-18,34491967,Heike,Everything was as described. Jessica is a great host and the location is an ideal starting point for roaming Boston. I'd definitely stay there again.
3344322,40967892,2015-08-03,37938666,Chelsea,"I was in Boston with friends and for work so I rarely had a free moment to speak with Jessica aside from when we passed like ships in the night. When we spoke she was always welcoming, accommodating, friendly, and inquisitive about my travels and needs. Loved that my space had air conditioning in the midst of a Boston heat wave. Straight 10/15 minute walk from the T which was great, and loved the breakfast joint near her house as well. Her home is rich with charm and filled with all of the amenities you could possibly need! I ran into some flight troubles and Jessica was quick to connect with me and help me plan what to do in the event that I was delayed an extra day - which alleviated so much stress! For that I am eternally grateful. Thank you for a wonderful first AirBNB experience!"

The house is beautiful, quirky and feels very homely. There is a great lounge to sit in, and my room was on the top floor and recently decorated, so in very good condition , with a comfortable bed and plenty of space. Parking on the street was easy. Just down the road there are a few options for evening meals, which Jessica advised me on. I chose the Harp and Bard, which was great. The Savin Hill station is around 10 mins walk and has the wonderful McKenna's just over the road, which is a perfect place to stop for breakfast o the way into Boston. This was my first Air BnB experience and it couldn't have been better."

The house is lovely, retaining a 19th century feeling, but with everything you need, the bed is comfortable, the top floor shower is great (I didn't try the other one), and there are 2 guitars ! And Jessica is a delightful and thoughtful host, with lots of helpful advice, interesting conversations, and delicious tea at any hour of the day or night. The neighbourhood is peaceful though with enough shops and restaurants to be able to get food by foot, and the T is just far enough to work up an appetite for a McKenna american breakfast and then its a quick trip into Boston."
3344322,75418229,2016-05-21,34321132,Yannick,I stayed at Jessica's house for over a week while hunting around for a more permanent place to stay and let's just say I could not have find a better place to stay!
Jessica is an amazing host and she really went out of her way to help me out of an unfortunate situation even as she was travelling away from the house. Even on the first night I got here super late at night she made sure that I would be able to get in to my room.,,,,,
Her house is very clean from the kitchen to the bedrooms and the bathrooms. The place is super quiet and in a very convenient neighbourhood close to restaurants,pharmacy,groceries and the Train. I work close to down-town and it's around a 30 mins commute with just a bit of a walk.,,,
You have an amazing place,thank you again Jessica!,,,,

3344322,77185451,2016-05-30,14932430,Marcelle,"We had a wonderful stay in Boston at Jessica's lovely home! Very close to main thoroughfares and public transportation; we pretty much parked our car and used public transit the remainder of our stay. Very convenient! The room was lovely and felt like being at home. Everything was neat and tidy and Jessica is a warm, kind hostess. We will definitely try to book here again if we're ever in Boston again!"
3344322,87287050,2016-07-19,52501270,Mia,Vi havde nogle rigtig gode dage hos Jessica! Huset lå i perfekt afsted til tog og i et hyggeligt kvarter. Jessica var hjælpsom og sød
3344322,96045173,2016-08-21,26102927,Rakan,"\"Jessica's home has multiple rooms. Accordingly, my review is for the \"\"Eagle's Nest\"\" room"
Jessica is the sweetest person ever—I wish had more time to sit and chat with her,but I was in town for a wedding and had a very packed schedule.,,,,
As for the Space,what you see is what you get; the pictures and listing descriptions were accurate. The Eagle's Next had an AC,which was nice,and a full bath across the hall. All rooms appeared to have their and extra lock and their own key.,,
My only real experience with the neighborhood was with respect to parking,walking to the Rite Aid,and taking Uber and/or Lyft.  Parking: I got in at 9:00 PM on a Friday and there was plenty of parking—on my second day there (Saturday),I even found a parking spot right in front of the house.  Rite Aid: my 5 minute walk to a Rite Aid on Saturday morning was pleasant,no issues. Uber and/or Lyft: I had no issues (regardless of time) getting Uber and/or Lyft to and from Jessica's house to and from various parts of Boston.,

3344322,97325554,2016-08-26,9523618,Sofija,Jessica was a great host. Would recommend to friends.
8970779,52291832,2015-10-27,3879617,Jason,"Sarah was an excellent communicator, and the room is exactly as advertised, bigger than I expected. The roommates I met were awesome, and the views of the city from right out the front door were spectacular. It's so close to the train into town. If you're looking for a lower cost, convenient alternative to city prices... while still being conveniently in the city... and you're comfortable with sharing a home, look no further!"
11980767,72621434,2016-05-04,51322773,Richard,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
11980767,74076922,2016-05-13,56540178,Ziying,Great location and nice studio. It is close to the central of the city so it is convenient to get to everywhere. The studio is clean and tidy. And Irene is very helpful and response immediately.
10299047,73095976,2016-05-06,42141888,Rachel,"We booked Brian's place as a place to stay over graduation weekend, and thanks to the fantastic kitchen and grill on the deck, we were able to have a BBQ graduation party! Walking distance to the Stony Brook T station. The listing and photos are very accurate, and Brian was a very responsive host."
10299047,74079739,2016-05-13,36567316,Dallin,"Had a great stay at Brian's condo. Just a short walk to the T station, and parking was surprisingly easy to find. Comfortable and well lit apartment."
10299047,74943771,2016-05-17,45767513,Lizzeth,"My family stayed here during my graduation. The apartment was spacious and they felt very comfortable during their stay. Brian is very considerate and informed us about things such as street cleaning and parking in the area. The apartment is a 5 minute walk to the metro, street parking is easy, and the Sam Adams brewery is really close ( free tour and tasting!). The corridor nearby is a nice green space to walk/jog as well. The apartment has a nice deck and a grill, which we didn't get a chance to use but seemed like a great addition!"
10299047,75643891,2016-05-22,41205171,Alissa,Awesome area! Sam Adams brewery less than a five minute walk. Listing was accurate. T stop very close to place and easy to get to! Would definitely stay here again!
10299047,77909469,2016-06-04,53342653,Patricia,"This was an easy and comfortable landing spot for a night. We could have stayed longer as downtown Jamaica Plain has some nice little shops and restaurants. The beds were comfortable, if small, and the bathroom had plenty of hot water and great shower."
Parking was easy and safe.,,,,,
It felt as though we were at a friend's house,"cozy and comfy. \"",,,,
10299047,80056501,2016-06-15,14159484,Kenny,Brian was a good host that made everything easy.

10299047,85827784,2016-07-13,46852223,Elizabeth,"Place was clean and nice. Unfortunately the outside of the building was under construction on the outside, so we had a noisy morning, though certainly not the fault of our host. Easy walk to the T through the park and right be the cafe for breakfast."
10299047,89426036,2016-07-28,14609765,Vanessa,Great place at a great location! Clean and had everything we needed. Host was accommodating with request for later check out. Will definitely stay there again.
10299047,92509144,2016-08-08,59658056,Dan,Perfect condo close to everything in Boston. Brian was very easy to communicate with throughout our stay.  This was my first time using Airbnb and he made the process simple. A great location for anyone visiting Boston- made everywhere assessable. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Brian- great place!
10299047,92884999,2016-08-10,83814110,Peter,"During our stay, we parked the car and explored Boston on transit and on foot. The location really worked well, it is very close to transit."
There is a restaurant and Cafe very close by.  This was very convenient way to start the day.,,,,,
The neighbourhood was safe,"the buildings on the block were older and some were in need of repair. \"",,,,
10299047,97011607,2016-08-25,26994960,April,"Nice place, very comfy.  I really appreciate having a great, safe central place to stay."
12560987,74435017,2016-05-15,64688224,Luther,Great apartment.  Lots of room.  We stayed prior to leaving in the morning out of Logan International.  It could not have been easier.
12560987,74654597,2016-05-16,17872199,Scott,"The condo was nice, clean, and conveniently close to a T station.  Shawn was very responsive and accommodating through texts and phone calls.  I would definitely stay there again."
12560987,75355551,2016-05-20,14977,Aki,"Shawn was great!  Very helpful.  We had one question, he resolved it very quickly and effectively."
12560987,76460690,2016-05-27,9862143,Bryan,Really great location with easy access to the subway. Had a great time!
12560987,77225274,2016-05-30,234146,Nicole,All 5 Stars!
Shawn's place was in an excellent location for our departure.  The house is only 1.5 miles away from Logan Int'l Airport,which makes departure very easy if you're taking Uber or LYFT.,,,,
You can tell Shawn has experience hosting because the rooms were clean,the beds made nicely,and the home comfortable for our party of 5.  The beds and pillows are some of the most comfy of any I've used through AirBnB over the last 5 years.,,,
There are 2 real bedrooms and one open room for a total of 3 queen sized beds.  The middle room is exposed and doesn't have a curtain or wall closing it in,so if you need privacy for everyone in the group,take that into consideration.  Also,the house is great for short term stays,but storage (drawer space) is limited if you'll be staying long term.,
Parking was difficult because the home is in a residential area and parking is only available on the street.  But if you can get there before it's too late at night,you should be able to find a space.  I was able to park on Webster Street up by the school.,,,,
Beware: Do not park anywhere covering a ramp.  Although there won't be a sign indicating the violation,"the ramps are considering handicapped access and a parking ticket will be issued.  \"",,,,
12560987,77742475,2016-06-03,4243873,Timothy,Place was clean and easy to get to. Shawn is always contactable via phone or email. He was very flexible with our check in and out times which helped with our flights.
12560987,78367498,2016-06-06,67943024,Ying,"\"Although a little bit away from central area, it's a good apartment at very convenient location. Also the apartment is very spacious, accommodating 6 people easily. Although one of the bedroom is kind of \"\"open\"\""
12560987,78863824,2016-06-09,75814581,Eric,Very clean and well kept apartment. The host was very responsive with a few questions we had during the trip as well.
12560987,79407356,2016-06-12,18894694,Keith,"Decent place clean and comfortable. Very close to subway,perfect for what we needed."
12560987,80157903,2016-06-16,53531951,Eric,"Had a great time. Super good location on blue line one stop away from tourist stuff at aquarium and near blue line stop for airport. We actually walked from airport to apt when we first arrived.  The apt was good.  Few things, no AC. It was ok for our trip but our last night without breeze, it was warm. There is construction around, so bring earplugs for sleeping. One bed is not in a bedroom, it is open to living room--no wall.  I think Shawn should put a heavy curtain to that opening.  btw, I think he might be adding AC. There was a portable one in the hall way."
12560987,80356616,2016-06-17,2118321,Claudia,Shawn was very accommodate to let us place our luggage there before check in time.
"Communication happen right the way.\"",,,,,
12560987,82652883,2016-06-28,73208259,Vicky,"We had a great time in Boston.    Shawn was very quick to response to my email or text message with detailed instruction to help me go thru the process.  Night before, he helped me to get the entrance instruction."
We arrived early and got early check in permission so we could leave luggage in the condo.  We met the cleaning guy.  He was very good!  The house was really cleaned.  I liked the towels they put in the bedroom.  Sufficient.  The pictures in the listing were real pic.  The whole condo was very clean for sure.  Kudos to the cleaning guy.  Beds were comfortable.,,,,,
We did had little trouble with toilet.  My husband told me that it could due to old houses in the East side of Boston.  The stairs were (URL HIDDEN) room felt little tilted. not leveled... Again,seemed due to the whole building condition.,,,,
East Boston was very easy access.  Great part with walking distance to see beautiful sun set and the harbor.  Also,there was a super good italian pizza express restaurant in the corner.  Great place!,,,,

12560987,82932476,2016-06-30,74056783,Jiayun,"Shawn的房间 完全就是梦想中的房子 虽然整栋房子楼梯有些潮潮的味道 但是三楼的屋内 完全没有味道 进门是厨房和餐厅 厨具一应俱全 我们在屋内享受了第二天的早餐 房间有一个开放式的房间联通客厅 还有两间带门的卧室 卫生间也很整洁 房间地理位置离机场很近 机场班车33或者88下车以后 穿过公园 再走7分钟就到了 入住完全是自助式的 非常方便,去波士顿城区 坐地铁2-3站 就可以直达"
Shawn's house is very beautiful and clean,we lived in the 3rd floor,kitchen equipped with all kinds of tableware,we enjoyed our breakfast in the house. It's has two bedrooms with door and one large bedroom connected with the living room. The location is very convenient which attracts me when I decided to book this house,it's about 15 minutes walk (via park) to shuttle bus stop to airport and about 5 minutes walk to subway station,"We would like to come again if come to Boston next time.\""
12560987,83507942,2016-07-03,59535552,Melissa,Great rental.  I loved the layout and large kitchen.  Walking up staircase to the third floor was a little tight with the cooler.  We took our chances and parked right out front with no problem.  A neighbor said they hardly ever saw a meter maid.  Would definitely stay here again!
12560987,84340675,2016-07-06,5444105,Marc,"It was an amazing experience, the location cannot be better."

12560987,86170557,2016-07-15,65669372,Lizabeth,Great location - easy 4 minutes to the Blue line. Apartment was clean and comfortable. Kitchen was spacious and had plenty of dishes and utensils for the three of us. Stairs were narrow and a little dark on the way down (before the automatic lights kicked on) but we felt very safe otherwise. Shawn was very quick to answer any of our questions. We had a wonderful time exploring Boston and this apartment was the perfect home base. We would definitely stay here again.
12560987,87066844,2016-07-18,11444480,Tim,We had a great stay at Shawn's condo this weekend. Everything went smoothly and the condo was a great home base for us for our visit. Thanks!
12560987,89581513,2016-07-29,60986199,Marcelle,"Great place to stay in Boston, Nice Neighbourhood . Good contact with the owner Shawn. We had à problem with vinding a parking lot for our car."
12560987,93353113,2016-08-12,77092462,Merlina,"Our stay was amazing. The instructions from our host were very helpful, as were his recommendations. The condo was very clean and well maintained. Overall our experience was a 10 out of 10."
12560987,94126198,2016-08-14,8433217,Lello,"it was a basic stay, we booked for 6 people and there were only four chairs for the kitchen, kitchen utensils were missing like basic things like glasses and other utensils. The flat was quite hot, as air con was only in sitting room. Ventilators didnt quite match the heat. It was ok for a short stay, but not to reccomend for 6 people as its a little cramped otherwise."
12560987,96416091,2016-08-22,75771430,Emily,"The location was very convenient - close to the airport and T station, so it was easy to travel throughout the city. Our group of 6 fit comfortably in the apartment - everyone had a bed and we were fine with only one bathroom. We spent most of our time out in the city, so we didn't relax much in the unit itself. There is a large TV but few channels, so if you plan to spend a lot of time in the condo, bring your own entertainment. We used the AC and it kept the space cool enough (it was over 80 degrees outside)."
My biggest concern with the unit was that the key doesn't work in the deadbolt. This would be an easy fix and would make the unit feel more secure.,,,,,
We were able to check-in a little early,but had to wait for the cleaning crew to finish. If you require an early check-in,I recommend contacting the host before booking to see if that would be an option.,,,
While the unit wasn't luxurious,"we felt it was a good value overall. \"",,,,

The apartment is cozy, and has all of the amenities you could need.  And of course, you can't beat the location.  His apartment is in the heart of Allston, which is now the cultural center of Boston for anyone looking for the best bars, clubs and restaurants in the area.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat!"

Everything was nice, neat & clean plus he had coffee, beer & wine waiting for us - what's not to like?  The area is very close to the T & an easy ride into Boston.  The immediate vicinity is safe with plenty of restaurants, bars & little stores.  I would definitely stay here again if I made my way back to Boston."
4909590,28882838,2015-03-31,28052502,Liana,This was my first time using Airbnb and I couldn't have asked for a better experience! Victor was very welcoming and made the process run very smoothly. He kept in contact leading up to my trip and gave me suggestions of things to do and places to go. He was there to meet us when we arrived and helped us get settled in.
The apartment itself is just wonderful. My boyfriend and I just loved it. It has everything you could need while you're away from home,and although there's no full kitchen,cooking your own food is still very doable. The location is fantastic - just a minute or so to the Harvard Ave. T station - which makes exploring Boston as simple as it possibly could be. There's plenty to do in Allston/Brighton itself if you don't feel like travelling to the city,too.,,
I would definitely,"100% recommend this place - and Victor - to anyone looking to visit Boston! So sad to be home!\"",,,,
4909590,29163041,2015-04-05,22506887,Guillaume,Thank you Victor! Your place was awesome. It had all we needed and  even more... beers were waiting in the fridge for us upon arrival!!
Victor was super friendly and helpful. The place was clean and tidy and the neigbours were very quiet.,,,,,
The apartment was located in a really cool neigbourhood of Boston where it was possible to find thrift shops,small restaurants,liquor stores,cafes and much more. It was also right in front of the tram\subway line,which brings you downtown in about 10-15 minutes. It wasn't too far from Harvard University either,which is reachable by foot in less than 30 minutes.

The entertainment set was awesome too. There were hundreds of channels to watch from the TV plus Apple TV and high speed wifi. He gave us great recommendations on where to eat and about the transportation in Boston. Overall, we really enjoy our stay in Victor's apartment. I will stay here again next time in Town :)"

The building is centrally located, near all things considered when traveling/exploring.   The studio inspired me to reformat my studio in Seattle in a similar fashion.  The loft bed was very comfortable, and there is a pull out bed underneath.   Overall a great experience."
I was visiting my daughter and he had asked me what she was into.  I mentioned a few things.  When arrived he set up his Apple TV and programmed her favorite shows and movies,stuffed the cooler with Mac n Chz and drinks.  I was surprised by his generous hospitality.,,,,

Perfect for Fenway park,Harvard,MIT,BU,shopping,downtown Freedom Trail
4909590,36702944,2015-06-30,34314678,Christine,"Victor was a great host, allowing us to check in early and meeting us within 30 minutes of my request to check in early. Description of the place is very accurate. We were a little adventurous and came with 1 adult and 3 children. The bottom bunk pull-out is perfect for a child under 10. The top bunk comfortably accommodated 2 kids and I imagine would be fine for 2 adults. The other sleeping spot might not suit everyone, although I found it surprisingly comfortable given that it's a wooden structure with a soft covering. The T noise was soothing but on Friday night the noise from young people in the street was bothersome.  The proximity to the T and great restaurants was the highlight. As another reviewer mentioned, the building itself is not well-maintained inside but this is somewhat typical and you just need to ignore that. Victor's place is well-kept and clean. I felt that everything had been carefully washed before our stay. Victor freed up a few drawers for us to unpack into. He even bought my kids' favorite ice cream and I was able to enjoy Keurig Starbucks every morning.  We loved our stay in Boston and our apartment suite stay was a part of the charm."
4909590,37165856,2015-07-05,33154822,Emily,Great location and great place. Victor was super helpful and gave great recommendations
4909590,37733330,2015-07-10,29426212,Gemma,"Victor was friendly friendly and super helpful on arrival, even providing us with snacks and a great selection of films on the tv! He has a very cool apartment, small but comfy and cosy - everything you need. It has great transport links into the city as well - Victor was prepared for us with a list of recommendations for the local area and further into town. A great place to stay."
4909590,38272254,2015-07-14,18833139,Andy,"We had a great stay, and are very grateful to Victor for setting things up to make us feel welcome. He describes the studio quite accurately.  Common areas of the building are run-down, but the studio was much nicer, cozy, and the bunk bed was comfortable, with plenty of head room. Window unit AC kept the apartment comfortable on a day that reached into the 90s. Easy access to the Green Line - right across the street - and several good restaurants. I had expected more street noise at night, being in a busy student area; but it was actually pretty quiet, even on the weekend."
4909590,38732910,2015-07-18,35438432,Polina,Victor's place was small but very well organized and designed. The bathroom was clean and had pages of books lining the walls which was very neat.
The lofted bed as well as the bed below it were both comfortable and the shelf near the lofted bed was great for putting stuff and had a power strip and dock/alarm to make it even more convenient.,,,,,
The addition of breakfast foods was also really nice as it was one less thing to worry about,as were the bottles of water.,,,,
The only problem I had was that the stairs for the lofted bed were slightly too spaced apart for my short stature.,,,,,
Otherwise,"the studio was awesome!\"",,,,
4909590,39277281,2015-07-22,4082530,Dario,"I was at Victor lovely house with my little son and my wife. Victor is a fantastic guy, his availability is enourmous and hus house is exactly as described, small but with everything needed and simply BEST. Before we arriving, Victor asked me which was our favorite foods or drinks, and which was the supereros preferred by Leonardo (my son). Thx to this he bought for us our preferred drink and prepared to netflix TV the transofmer films for Leonardo. He left us a lot of water, something for breakfast and for dinner too. This make the difference!! We found this place very wonderful. The zone is good and the parking is simple, just look to the road cleaning day ;)."
Even if train and bus are very near,we never took them but we just walked to downtown,to Legoland,to Harvard university ... The house is very near to most of principal attraction,by bus or train or,if you love walk like us
4909590,39933976,2015-07-27,32787680,Cody,"My friends and I highly enjoyed our stay at Victor’s place and would highly recommend it! Victor’s listing description was very accurate and the pictures are exactly as it appears in person. The neighbourhood felt very safe and had many amenities close by (small grocery market, liquor store, pizza place, Irish pub) which was great for nights when we got back late and wanted to pick something up. It is not even a 5 minute walk to the green line and it was very easy to travel by subway anywhere we wanted to go."
It was very helpful that in the apartment Victor had laminated lists with local information such as restaurants,his contact information and the apartment’s information as well.,,,,
Even before we arrived Victor was very welcoming taking the time to help explain to us how to take public transportation to the concert we were going to,and asking us what drinks or snacks we liked and stocking the apartment with them. He also had breakfast supplies and some other basic goods and that was a huge cost saver in the mornings! He had a huge stock pile of towels,linens,etc.,,
The bed situation is unique – the roll out bed is very short and the couch can be slept on but isn’t necessarily meant to so just make sure you know all your people can fit okay in the space that is there! The bed up top was much comfier and spacious. Victor also provided an air mattress so he gives his guests lots of options.,,,,,
This is a very creative space and Victor does an amazing job using all available space and creating a welcoming environment.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4909590,40273178,2015-07-29,21187914,Dan,"I recently stayed at Victor's place for two nights and had a great stay!  Victor was extremely easy to communicate with to arrange a meeting time to exchange keys, at which time he also gave a quick tour of the building as well as all the rooms and details at his place."
His place was very clean,neat and organized - you can tell that Victor really takes time to make sure his guests feel comfortable on arrival and throughout their stay.  The bed on the loft was comfortable,"the AC Unit in the window cooled the place down nicely and the bathroom/shower was very clean and nicely sized.  Victor even left us assorted snacks and drinks to enjoy while at the place.  The location was perfect for using the T as the \"\"Harvard Ave.\"\" stop on the Green Line is a 30 second walk across the street out front of the place.",,,
All in all --- Great Host,Great Location,"Great Stay!\"",,,
4909590,40570137,2015-08-01,12297063,Sarah,"Victor is a great, accommodating host and his hand-built studio is so full of character.  The space is just as it is described - small, creative and functional - and it was perfect for my sister and I on our recent college-nostalgia trip to Boston!  Perfect location right on the Green Line so we could hop right on the T and head into town.  It was a very enjoyable stay!"
4909590,40770576,2015-08-02,36764225,志杰,"Victor is very accommodating and nice! He patiently told us how to get to the house and show us inside. It's as great as what it seems in the pictures. There are food and drink in the kitchen and everything you want to be in your home! There is a metro station just outside the house which is very convenient for us. If you are traveling Boston, this is definitely a good place to stay!"
4909590,41351843,2015-08-07,33973336,Da,"Few days before I arrive at the studio, he asked me if I prefer coffee and beer, and what do I have with. The day I arrived the studio, Victor welcomed with cookies, muffins and beer! And I can have coffee whenever I want! He was really kind and his studio was also great! There was everything I want, and I liked the inside the studio that he made. Its location is great many public transportation to Harvard and center of Boston is just in front of the studio! I highly recommend this studio."
4909590,41999381,2015-08-10,38350860,Lucy,"Victor was very helpful and met us at the apartment at the time we requested, he asked us what food and drink we would like and gave us advice on the city. The apartment was perfect and in a great location, we would definitely stay there again."
4909590,42510237,2015-08-14,23396131,Harriet,"Excellent studio apartment right near a T stop. Was easy to find and in a good spot. Victor left us a great selection of beer, soda and snacks as well as recommendations for dinner. He made sure we felt at home and was very friendly. The Apple TV was greatly appreciated! All in all, a very good experience."
4909590,42850228,2015-08-16,7039766,Sun,This is my second time staying at Victor's for a reason:  the room is awesome and Victor is a generous and an organized host that really cares about his guests' experience.
I would say that the space is appropriate for many travelers.  Whether you are a single traveler on an adventure,or visiting your children and having family night.  It works perfect.,,,,
If it's available,"I'll be booking my third visit at his spot.\"",,,,
4909590,43474726,2015-08-20,26864481,Valentina,Victor ci ha accolte con estrema gentilezza e calore: si è reso disponibile ad accoglierci al nostro orario di arrivo nonostante fosse diverso da quello di check in.
Durante il nostro incontro ci ha illustrato l'appartamento e soprattutto si è reso totalmente disponibile per qualunque nostra necessità: è stato subito evidente quanto Victor sia una persona simpatica e gentilissima.,,,,,
L'appartamento è pulito ed estremamente comodo e funzionale: al suo interno c'è tutto il necessario per vivere un ottimo soggiorno. Ho apprezzato moltissimo i fogli plastificati appesi sopra il televisore contenenti numeri/informazioni necessarie a qualunque nostra necessità. Oltre a ciò,Victor ci ha fatto trovare il necessario per fare colazione (ci ha chiesto via mail cosa preferissimo: davvero carino!!) ed anche acqua ed alcolici nel frigo.,,,,
La zona è tranquilla e ricca di ristoranti e bar e di fronte casa ferma la metro verde che passa frequentemente.,,,,,
Suggerisco assolutamente questa location per chiunque voglia passare qualche fantastica giornata a Boston e,se dovessi tornare nuovamente in questa città,"sicuramente tornerei da Victor.  \"",,,
4909590,43802865,2015-08-22,38876892,Dazhan,"Awesome place, excellent location and generous host. A really clean and organized studio which has been decorated himself. Right next to a T stop which is super convenient. Host Victor responded very quickly and offered us coffee and green tea! Definitely recommend to have a stay there! Thank you so much Victor!"
4909590,44521472,2015-08-27,32731141,Sébastien,"Victor is great and the place is great too. The apt is very well located,  just have to cross the street to get the B green line, it's near a pub with live bands every night , five minutes walk to the best guitar store of boston, a comic book shop,  a  supermarket, etc.. nothing is missing."
Victor has welcomed us with cold beers,a bottle of wine and 2 buckets full of coffee capsules. The shelves loaded with good books..,,,,
The apartment is comfy.. only pleasure. Thx!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4909590,45458675,2015-09-03,27037000,Keith,"We stayed in Victor's apartment for 4 nights and really enjoyed it. It's very close to a T stop which brings you straight into central Boston. We also enjoyed the area of Allston, lots going on and loads of places to eat and drink.  We were able to walk to Harvard from the apartment and got a bus back almost to the door. Victor was a great host, the apartment is clean, tidy and pretty funky! The kitchen was also well stocked which we really appreciated.  Thanks Victor!!"
4909590,46274751,2015-09-09,36031819,Millie,"Victor was an amazing host. He was there to greet us when we arrived at the apartment and was so helpful. He showed us around the compact space and gave us a load of suggestions for places to visit and things to do. He also provided us with snacks, wine and delicious tea and coffee. We loved the apartment which is conveniently right next to the subway line that goes straight to the centre of Boston. It had eveythinf we needed for our short visit to Boston and plenty of sleeping options too."
4909590,46731598,2015-09-13,30875789,Lyubov,"Victor greeted me at the doorstep of the complex, helped me into the studio with my luggage and provided a detailed description of the home and its components (including snacks and food with which he kindly stocked the kitchen). Information about the neighborhood, wifi information, and his contact information were clearly posted. The neighborhood felt very safe during weekdays and the weekend with the green-line Harvard Ave T-stop just two blocks away."
4909590,47348102,2015-09-18,34372571,Shelly,"Victor is a great host, he called ahead to find out what we eat and drink and we found some cheez, wine and snaks for the kids when we arived. He was also flexable with check in hours, and made us feel welcomed."
Neighbourhood was good. A 2 min walk from the T,with super markets,cvs,resturants and bars with short walking distance. The place itself was impressive,and managed to  accommodate four people comfortably,kitchen well equipped
4909590,47854263,2015-09-21,43892499,Verena,Victor was a great host! :) The apartment was perfect and close to a train and bus station :) We enjoyed the weekend in Boston very much. It is a great city! :) You don´t drive long to Boston Downtown and Harvard. So the location was perfect for us. :)
"He was also very helpful if there are any questions about Boston or the apartment. :)\"",,,,,
4909590,47967893,2015-09-22,22666229,Trish,Victor is soooo hospitable! Let us drop off our luggage early- gave recommendations on the area- extremely accommodating. The unit is well put together and accommodated three of us perfectly. Would definitely recommend staying here! Thanks again!!

4909590,49596629,2015-10-05,37058108,Adrian,Small but well organized and nicely stocked.
Host was very accommodating and pleasant.,,,,,

4909590,50273447,2015-10-11,22341162,Daisy,"Victor's place was really cool and perfect for my husband & I. Victor was super welcoming when we arrived in the evening and had bought in some beers, coffee, snacks and water for us which was great. He showed us around the place and gave us a couple of tips and then left us to relax in his awesome apartment. The location was really good - plenty of bars and restaurants near by and easy for transport downtown on the T, we also got the bus to Harvard from down the street. Thanks Victor!"
4909590,50769305,2015-10-14,33611099,Heidi,Victor was a terrific host. He met me upon check in and had the place well stocked. He provided a great list of nearby restaurants. I would definitely stay at Victor's place again!
4909590,50997387,2015-10-16,1108315,Isaac,"Victor was fantastic, definitely one of the most welcoming hosts I've had at an AirBnB. He was kind enough to let me check in early and brought me a bottle of wine and explained everything about the apartment."
The place was perfect for one or two people and was decorated with many cool photographs. I especially appreciated the left-handed electric guitars and collection of vintage effects pedals. The loft bed is comfortable,though a little tricky to jump in and out of,especially in the middle of the night when it's dark. Everything is well laid out and convenient. There is a tiny kitchen area that has a small refrigerator stocked with snacks and bottled water,a very thoughtful touch. The bathroom was clean and well stocked with towels.,,
The apartment is in an older building that seems to house a lot of students from the nearby college. The public stairwell areas seem kind of run down and dingy,but the apartment itself is nice and clean.,,,,
The Green Line T stop is literally a 2 minute walk away. It was very convenient,even though the Green Line can take a while to get in and out of the city.,,,,
"I had a great stay and would stay here again.\"",,,,,
4909590,51116656,2015-10-18,38784929,Ellen,Excellent experience.  Victor was very attentive and made every effort to make my stay convenient and easy for me.  Everything was comfortable and fully functioning.  I highly recommend.
4909590,51781517,2015-10-24,7777586,Lauren,We stayed at Victor's for 2 nights. It was absolutely perfect. He has a great eye for design and has creatively used the space. The loft bed was so comfortable!! Anything we could have needed (including beers!) was available and everything was very clean. If we find ourselves in Boston again we will definitely try to stay here.
4909590,51971431,2015-10-25,1970961,Itty,"Victor was incredibly accommodating, providing us with snacks and great instructions on everything in the place since we weren't able to meet him in person. He was also very flexible when our arrival time changed and was great with communication."
4909590,52249196,2015-10-27,45093548,Marie-Hélène,"Chouette petit studio, à 2 pas du train. Facile de se stationner dans les rues avoisinantes sans se casser la tête et de profiter du transport en commun. En plus Victor nous avait laisser de la bière au frigo et du café pour le matin!  :)"
4909590,52487293,2015-10-30,26494618,Lauren Mae,"Victor was extremely helpful and welxoming. He left coffee, beer and snacks for us in the kitchen. It was really great!"

It has a wonderful location, close to the metro, CVS and surrounded by many great restaurants (even close to a Brazilian bakery, what else could I ask for?!?). Victor was a perfect host, promptly replying to any contact I made before and upon arrival. He also very nicely provided us with milk, water, beer, coffee, snacks and breakfast food - we were very happy about everything and loved our stay. Will definitely stay there again if I am back in Boston and totally recommend for anyone in the area. Thank you, Victor!"
4909590,54303379,2015-11-17,5827333,Naelle,"Victor was amazing! He's so nice and hospitable, he even has an array of snacks for you to choose from. The place was even more adorable than the pictures, and conveniently located between a pizza place and a cvs. Access to the T was a great plus. Only a 3 minute walk and all of Boston is at your fingertips."
4909590,55228584,2015-11-29,47143652,Ji,"Victor prepared everything well, although we didn't get to meet him but instructions to the keys were fairly clear, and things are sufficient and smooth. It is very easy to get untidy in such a small area especially when we were a group of four, but I'm glad that we managed to leave the room as clean as what Victor provided us. Enjoyed the stay!"
4909590,56947645,2015-12-20,49490165,Huajin,"I work in Boston and stayed at Victors apartment for ~20 days before moving to another city. Victor was a great host! He stuffed the fridge with beer, water, and even prepared snacks that I like! The apartment is small but space is used very efficiently with furnitures optimized for small space living, so the place does not feel cramped at all! I think Victor made most of the furnitures himself...very impressive. There are also lots of details in the apartment that I liked, eg. interesting pictures allover the walls of the apartment, hanging tin buckets everywhere, bathroom wall artistically covered with book pages as wall paper. The kitchen is small and simple and not for lots of cooking, but has essentials to make simple food. I love that he has a kruegur coffee maker, and even coffee pods in one of the tin buckets so I get can caffeinated without getting out of the house. In the winter the place is a bit cold, especially on the couch near the window, but there is a heater that warms up the space efficiently. As for the Allston neighborhood, lots of students live here, so it is has a good mix of hip and cheap shops a short walk away to cater people of different needs."
4909590,58280159,2016-01-02,24663309,Cristina,"Victor's place is amazing. It is a studio and yet it can fit in so much. It is creatively decorated and it has everything you would need for a short or long stay in Boston. It is centrally located - close to the city, Harvard, Boston college, Boston university and restaurants and quite unique shops. He made our stay that extra special by asking what we liked to watch on Netflix and what we liked to eat and drink. When we arrived at the studio, there were the food, snacks and drinks that we liked and Victor had programmed his Netflix with shows we would like. I would not hesitate to recommend Victor's place. If I never need to return to the area, I would definitely rent Victor's place again. Best wishes to you Victor."
4909590,61034035,2016-01-31,33129369,Isangi,"First off, Victor was great to work with. My boyfriend met him and spoke with him mostly. Whenever we had questions, he would get back to us right away. He even asked if we would like our sheets changed during our stay!"
Before arriving,I have to say,I was a bit nervous because of the square footage...,,,
As soon as I walked in the apartment,I was pleasantly surprised! I fell in love with this apartment. Victor has decorated and arranged the furniture in such a way that it felt so much larger than what it is. I thought we might of over packed but everything we brought,we found a place for thanks to the way Victor has designed this beautiful apartment.,,,
My boyfriend and I stayed for a month. We work on our laptops and we just require strong internet. The internet worked absolutely perfect. When you enter in the apartment,there is this office space which I would work in when my boyfriend had phone meetings. I definitely did not feel like my boyfriend and I were cramped while working in the day time.,,,,
Victor left us our favorite snacks in the cute kitchen area. We cooked a lot in the kitchen and did not feel limited considering it was just an electric stove top. There was Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks K-cups as well as tea. There was still a lot left over after staying a month there!,,,,,
There is a coin operated laundry machine in the basement. No one is really there on the weekdays. It was very helpful considering we were there for a month. Victor even had laundry detergent!,,,,,
We brought our car and luckily Victor has a parking pass that is about a 5 min walk away but luckily we were able to find street parking just outside the building or in back. There was no need to really use the car since the B Green Line was right in front.,,,,,
The area is absolutely amazing. And within walking distance.,,,,,
I am from Boston so it was great to revisit some favorite places. If you enjoy consignment shops and vinyl,be prepared to bring an extra bag. There is a Buffalo Exchange and like 2 more thrift stores on that same street. Be prepared!,,,,
Great Scott is a must visit if you enjoy seeing live bands play. Food options vary from Pizza,Brunch,Mediterranean (Garlic and Lime is delicious),Korean,Froyo,and Sushi.
There is also a CVS and a grocery store (B Fresh) within walking distance. And of course plenty of coffee shops or Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks if you want something familiar.,,,,,
There is a TD banks and Bank of America. We got our quarters at TD bank for laundry day.,,,,,
I HIGHLY recommend booking this place. Stop thinking about it! Just book it.,,,,,
This will for sure be where we stay for all our Boston visits.,,,,,
"Thanks Victor!\"",,,,,
4909590,63844211,2016-02-27,59624480,Jason,"Vj's place was great. It looks exactly like the pictures and was extremely comfortable. I stayed there alone for a week and felt I had plenty of room to stretch out. Knowing the area, I was nervous about noise both inside and outside the building, but it wasn't a problem at all - not even the T right out the front door. The wifi worked great and I was able to relax at night with Netflix and Hulu. The kitchen was fine with a dorm style fridge, dual cooktop and microwave, and I appreciated the office to get a little work done while I was there."
Vj was also great. He met me at the door and showed me around. I was already familiar with the area so I didn't need much introduction,but he can help you out if you are looking for something to do. I didn't see him again,although he lives very close if there is a problem.,,,
If you are looking to stay in Allston/Bright,"this is the place to rent. Thanks Vj.\"",,,,

Victor's use of space was very creative and efficient. He kept in contact way in advance and asked me what my favorite drinks and snacks were and provided them when I got there. He's super nice and talented.,,,,,
The apartment was cozy and was just what I needed for my stay in Boston. He has wifi,Apple TV (with a plethora of choices),a little kitchen and 3 beds.,,,
The location is really convenient because there's a grocery store a few blocks away and the T stop is right across the street.,,,,,

I am a frequent Airbnb user and I always appreciative when Victors place is open to book.  My daughter and I have had many great experiences staying at his studio, it feels like a soulful home rather than a sterile setup.  If you visit Boston, I recommend to check out his spot."

4909590,71902875,2016-04-29,14059835,Chandra,Victor made space for us and was even kind enough to buy peanut butter for Matt as a special treat! We loved staying in this studio as a retreat in such a lively part of the city.
The studio has been setup to use the available space brilliantly (we learned some things) and feels very comfortable.,,,,,
This area is very convenient to the B Green Line,"and we were grateful for the use of a parking pass as well. Lots of delicious restaurants as well as stores are within walking distance - Victor had great recommendations!\"",,,,
4909590,72880308,2016-05-05,54327753,Annie,"Victor was a great and attentive host. He was very courteous and made me feel right at home. He was very thorough with explaining the neighborhood's attractions and his home was nicely made up and clean. If there were any problems, he was quick to respond and help."
4909590,73101781,2016-05-06,70214409,Li,The house was great. Really loved how they put the book pages on the wall. The host was really nice and really cool. The house is really cool too! They have every thing prepared for you. Extremely recommended!
4909590,73838842,2016-05-10,11822609,Jerneja,"Staying at Victor's place was the best decision ever!! The train stops right in front of the buildings and it's easy to get to downtown. The flat was nice, artistic, and above all very comfortable. It was clean when we got there, Victor even left us some beer, water, and supplies for breakfast as well as coffee or tea. If I had a question, he was quick to reply. We could always count on him. We had the best time ever!! Thank you Victor! I would definitely recommend his flat to every person who visits Boston!"
4909590,73921348,2016-05-11,43557895,Nick,I loved the fact the everything was in walking distance. It was a beautiful area and his place was very cozy! 10/10 hands down would stay here again!
4909590,74696194,2016-05-16,26912322,Tatjana,"We loved the space. It was a relatively small space but extremely functional. The host was very welcoming and generous, treating us with chocolate upon our arrival. The fridge full of water. The apartment was clean. And most importantly, for our purposes, very close to Boston University, where we spent our time. Thank you Vj!"

4909590,76256857,2016-05-26,73632616,Nicole,Victor was great! His place was in a great area with lots of great restaurants and easy access to the T. He stocked the fridge with breakfast fixins' and steared us to a great spot for watching the hockey game where it happened to also be mystery beer night which we had fun with.
4909590,77128307,2016-05-30,16218898,Christina,Great place to stay.  It is nice and cozy.  Very close to the T.   Bed was very conformable.  VJ is very responsive if anything would arise.  Great time in Boston!

Il suo appartamento è carino e pulito, e per di più in ottima posizione per visitare Boston (la metro passa proprio davanti e c'è un bus diretto per Harvard). Il quartiere è tranquillo è dispone di bar e supermercati."
E' disponibile anche un cucinino per piccoli pasti,non manca niente! Bellissime le foto appese ai muri,"ci si perde a guardarle!\"",,,

4909590,80049679,2016-06-15,42532899,David Seth,Victor made us feel very welcome on our first trip to Boston. The restaurant/bar suggestions were great and helped us feel some of the local vibe! Would definitely recommend this studio apartment as it is a great location and well kept.
I will say it might get a little cramped for more than just a couple people,but we had two and it was perfect.,,,,

4909590,83134566,2016-07-01,44603493,Melina,Really enjoyed Victor's apartment; it is a really cute place to be at equipped with everything you need. Victor waited for us upon arrival and showed us around. Subway to the city is right across the street.
4909590,85457167,2016-07-11,24051464,Martin,"Super host. Very attentive and followed up throughout the stay. Set us up with beer, water and chips (asked us what kinds we wanted before). The only thing is that the beds are a bit short (at least for four norwegian guys), but that's details, and wasn't really a huge problem."
The bathroom door is basically just a drape,but this was clearly stated in images - all in all the apartment was as presented,"and that honesty is really what I appreciate when staying at Airbnb. No surprises!\"",,,
4909590,86500156,2016-07-16,56362297,Natalie,great host. apt looks like pictures
4909590,88204341,2016-07-23,17824591,Khanh,Victor has been a great host. Very tentative to your needs and response quickly when you have any questions.  We forgot our door keys one night and Victor drove down to let us in right after we called.  The apartment is small but very connivence and stock with everything would needs for your stay.  Our stayed has been great and we will book with it again when we are back in Boston.

讓我們提早checkin 行李,,,,,
四個人可能會有一點擠,,,,,
上面的床睡兩個人除非是小朋友不然有點擠,,,,,
但是我們就兩個人睡地板,,,,,
一個人睡沙發床然後廁所是跟外面只有一片簾子隔起來,,,,,

Common areas were a surprise and some tenants in the building were causing some commotion during our stay, but overall enjoyable."

The pictures were accurate, water and beer were provided, and he left a list of restaurants in the area (which was super helpful to people who didn't know the area very well).  AirPlay connection to the TV was just an added plus.  Clean and comfortable - highly recommend!"
4909590,92191226,2016-08-07,44045131,Wenyuh,"Though we didn't see Victor in person, I'm pretty sure he is a nice host. He made simple instructions to follow, and the house is full-equipped. The location is so great, very convenient. Everything is good, the only thing I don't like is the light in the house, is not bright enough, especially the kitchen. All in all, I still highly recommend Victor's house. Thank you, Victor!"
4909590,92668836,2016-08-09,14541979,Paul,VJ was the most amazing host during our time in Boston. Our flight was delayed and we had many problems getting there but he was completely understanding and helped out every step of the way. The apartment itself is a great little studio with everything you could need for your stay. It's in a very vibrant area with lots of bars and shops close by. Also very easy to get into downtown by public transport. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
4909590,93217868,2016-08-12,45667507,Anthony,"The unit is a great option for a quick stay in a good location.  Easy access to the T and main blvd.  Vj was very good with communication and his unit was very clean and well kept.  It is important to note that while the unit is nice, the building and common areas are not.  Common areas are quite run down and in urgent need of renovation."

4275846,22545131,2014-11-09,22711205,Sarah,"We were met by Ahmed's assistant Eddie who was very friendly and gave us lots of tips about where to eat etc. Our bus arrived into Boston much later than anticipated but Eddie was very flexible & accomodating. The flat is in a superb location in terms of being close to the centre of Boston & many sight seeing attractions, and there are loads of bars, restaurants & several T stops right on the doorstep. This has the downside of being noisey at night. The flat itself isn't quite as pictued - it's a studio flat just big enough for two people. It's up two flights of stairs and as it is a hundred year old building you forgive it for being somewhat rough around the edges. I think the flat had recently been redecorated so it was a bit under-equipped and not much in the way of utensils etc. but this could be easily fixed and what was there was new. Overall we had a good stay though the price is steep for what you get compared to other places we have stayed."
4275846,30378752,2015-04-21,21128823,Bart,"Eddie the host was very accommodating and the studio is a great location in Boston.  If that's all you care about, it's a great place to stay!  I probably wouldn't rent again for a few reasons:"
- It's very loud at night (even at 3am),and the holes in the windows don't help keep a quiet space,,,,
- The theater across the street has very bright lights and the cheap window shades really don't work that well,,,,,
- It was fairly dirty and had holes in the walls,,,,,
- Half the power outlets didn't work,,,,,
"- There were no pots and pans and only a few plastic utensils (no forks at all) \"",,,,,

We arrived very late, around 1am, and Ahmed's assistant Eddie was very accommodating and helpful with how to get around Boston.  The location was great! Walking distance to many of the touristy things to do, and many T stations.  This was our first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better!"

4275846,35696188,2015-06-21,10554115,Kriskha,"I got to wait 15 mins before checking in because the place wasn't ready.Came in and place was all dusty. Seems like a nice place, but dusty. My mom and i had to spend 45 mins to clean the room. Half of the power outlets are broken. I open the wardrobe and it's not even installed yet.There's stain on the blanket too. I know it says in the listing it'll get noisy on like weekends and especially at  night due to the place facing towards the street and there are holes on the window too . So i guess you can judge how my experience went."
4275846,36052444,2015-06-24,35654912,Danny,This spot is great for those that wish to stay in a great location at a cheap price. Expect nothing more and nothing less.  The building is old and everything felt a bit dirty but if you just need a place to crash this is it.
Here is my experience:,,,,,
Air conditioning was advertised but was not installed.  It was a hot/humid weekend so had I known there was no AC I would have rented elsewhere. Having prepaid for this place,I felt a bit cheated.,,,,
Ahmed and I ended up exchanging over 20 messages for the next two days to coordinate the installation of the AC,which is not something I want to be doing on a business trip/vacation. This disorganization  caused unnecessary stress and led to him asking us to leave the apartment to install the AC only to return with the AC not installed. I had to make changes to my schedule and be out of the apartment for a certain time period of the day to accommodate for something that should have been taken care of prior to my arrival and in the end nothing happened. This ordeal was beyond irritating and highly unprofessional.,,,,
Ahmed was nice enough to lend us his office space so that I could do my work and even comped me a night for the inconvenience. However,"all this could have been avoided. I appreciate the partial refund and gratuity on his part but I'd much rather pay more for a seamless experience elsewhere and not be bothered on my vacation.  Wouldn't rent again. \"",,,,
4275846,37698834,2015-07-09,37049696,Stephanie,The apartment was in an ideal location with easy access to all the key tourist spots in Boston. We had all we needed in the apartment including towels and toiletries. Eddie welcomed us and offered us advice about places to visit and transport. He was also very helpful when we contacted him with questions during our stay. We really enjoyed our stay here. Thank you!

4275846,38419088,2015-07-15,35915183,Dean,"This was my first airbnb experience. I was greeted by Ahmed's assistant Eddie at the Panera Bread across the street, he took me over to the place and showed me around and made sure that I knew how to operate everything. He gave me his cell phone number and instructed me to text him if anything came up. Despite the age of the building, the studio apartment was quite clean (the hallways in the building are worn out looking, but that's nothing they can control and it is a 100 year old building. You just need to look past that). It's in the theater district of Boston and just down the street from Boston Commons. Lot's of places to eat nearby (Rock Bottom, Legal Seafoods, Subway, pizza joint, German food place, several pubs). The traffic outside can get noisy fairly early in the morning, so take that into consideration based on your sleeping habits.  I'm not a high-maintenance traveler and just need a place to sleep, take a shower, and check/respond to email. The apt. had internet access which had decent bandwidth speed. Compared to the costs of hotels ($279/night and up) in the area, I would not have any hesitations about staying here in the future. Thanks Eddie and Ahmed for hosting!"

El aire acondicionado funcionaba a la perfección, no el control de la TV, pero ese no fue problema para mi. El WiFi también funcionaba de manera correcta, la cocina perfectamente equipada y funcionando (aunque no utilicé la estufa). Pero....algunos los comentarios de otros usuarios resultaron ciertos, por ejemplo agujeros en las ventanas!.... Ahmed comentó que los reparará. Otra observación que tengo, y que no vi que la hiciera ningún otro usuario, es que el edificio a pesar de ser de \"\"No Fumar\"\""

It was indeed very clean and simple.  The bed was comfortable and the air conditioner was wonderful.  The widow shades don't work so they stay permanently down, which is needed since you're right on the street.  The bathroom is modest and utilitarian and serves the purpose without complications.   If you don't mind the interior of the building, a two floor walk up, and a little street noise, this is a great little place to crash with an affordable price, give Ahmed's a shot!"

4275846,47162903,2015-09-16,29065371,Ghislain,The pictures of the apartment are attractive but the truth is not the same. The blinds of all the windows are broken so you live in the dark. In fact it's not important because the windows are so dirty that we can't see outside. The windows are broken so you're sleeping in the street. The shower is  broken and fixed by a big yellow scotch.
4275846,47378763,2015-09-18,33962753,Francis,Clean and simple apartment. Very good location.

As other guests have mentioned, there is a lot of street noise through the night, but knowing that beforehand eliminated the surprise factor. It is to be expected in a downtown theater district. The neighborhood is great and you could not ask for a more central location. Everything was easy to get to from the apartment."
My only caution to future guests is that if you are a super light sleeper (which I have never been),bring earplugs. Otherwise,"I would recommend this apartment to anyone.\"",,,

4275846,50905377,2015-10-15,17741848,Dave,Overall I had a good stay and found the studio to be a good value for the area but far from perfect.  Here is my good bad and ugly:
The Good:,,,,,
Nicely renovated studio apartment in a lively area at a very reasonable price (hotels and other AirBnB's are easily 2x the daily price).  Easy access to anywhere in the city and lots of great eateries and bars within walking distance.  The building is an older building but has a certain amount of that local neighborhood charm.  I had a relaxing one night stay.,,,,,
The Bad:,,,,,
What works in its favor also works against it as the building is on a main street in the theater district.  The apartment I stayed in was a street facing 3rd floor walk up where lots of light (theater lights and billboard right outside the window) and street noise easily penetrate it the studio.  Now I'm a born and raised NYer so this did not bother me at all and I slept great but if you are used to dark quiet nights you are in for a long night.,,,,,
The Ugly,,,,,
This studio could go from good value to great find with just a little TLC.  The issues I encountered were not major items but are also can be easily (and cheaply) addressed which would have made my experience would be so much better.  Additionally communication from Ahmed could have been better.  There was no pro-active messaging like I am used to from other hosts.  I needed to message him and then i was handed off to an assistant who handed me off to the building super,"who was very nice but again the overall experience was not very welcoming. \"",,,,
4275846,52489583,2015-10-30,20078026,Lauren,We enjoyed our short stay at Ahmed's place across from the Majestic. We are from a sleepy farm town in upstate NY so the noise from the street below was super hard for us to get adjusted to at night. We didn't sleep that well although the bed was pretty comfortable for just being on the floor. All the amenities were there that we needed and his assistant Carla who was there to greet us and was super helpful with all of our questions. The studio is a great location for night life in the Theater district. The picture window gives a beautiful view on the Majestic lights across the street. Great late night pizza place directly below as well. Thanks Ahmed!
4275846,52732011,2015-11-01,19308483,Alix,"My stay at Ahmed's studio was great. The place was in such a GREAT location. Truly in a perfect spot at an unbeatable price.

"\"",,,,,
4275846,56844985,2015-12-19,16087404,Patrick,The studio was a little loud initially but all of the windows were replaced during my stay which made the apartment much quieter.
4275846,58654277,2016-01-03,46897361,ShuoYao,"That was a great time to stay at Ahmed's apartment, great location !"
4275846,61541718,2016-02-05,23254455,Chandra,"The location is great! The T (subway) stop is very, very close to the apartment—I really enjoyed being able to have quick and easy access to the green and orange lines (both lines transfer to the red line one stop away) and the red line with a bit more of a walk. The apartment was also close enough for me to walk to and from South Station as well. There is great food in the neighborhood, and the Boston Common is wonderful to walk through."
As others have mentioned,the apartment lets in quite a bit of noise at night from the busy street below,but I am pretty used to city noises and read this in other reviews so I wasn't too surprised.,,,
Eddie let me in the apartment and gave me a great list of things to do in the area,he was welcoming and friendly! I was also able to contact him if I needed anything,"which made me feel comfortable.\"",,,
4275846,64306585,2016-03-02,3475591,Hoeteck,"I had a great stay at the studio! The location is truly amazing: very close to the red and green lines, cafes,  Chinatown restaurants, shopping at Downtown Crossing, theaters, and the Boston Commons, and I also got a great price for my stay in the early spring. I received the check-in instructions about a little over a day before checking in, but everything worked out just fine. I would definitely stay there again -- thanks, Ahmed and his team!"

4275846,65841613,2016-03-17,51424883,Rob,"This was a business reservation for another guest so my knowledge of the stay is second hand.  That said, I was told that the Theater District location of the property can get a little loud, especially at 2:00am when people are leaving the neighborhood bars and arguing about where they're going to go to get pizza.  It was also mentioned that some of the furnishings could use an update but, in general, everything was acceptable and the price vs. location made it a good deal."
"Thank you\"",,,,,
4275846,66946067,2016-03-25,58044529,Harshad,"The house location was excellent and very convenient. The house looked exactly what I had expected looking at the pictures. I had booked this house on behalf of my sister and she, her husband and their 2year daughter stayed in this place. So I write this on her behalf, her experience was not overwhelming at all. They majorly faced 3 issues in her 1day of stay, first, the bed is old and squeaky ( it was almost impossible to move one's body without making annoying sounds.)  Second, the heater @ 80degree was not enough. It did not provide sufficient heating.Thankfully, there was a small portable heater kept for extreme weather which helped them survive the night. Thirdly, there was no hot water available till 10.00am. She also asked me to request for a refund as the price was exorbitant for the mediocre experience she has had. That said, there were no issue contacting Ahmeds assistant Eddie ans Kim and were always available. They helped start hot water in the morning."

Das Apartment selbst ist exakt wie auf den Fotos beschrieben. Wenn man nicht gerade das Ritz Carlton erwartet,wird man nicht negativ überrascht werden. Geräuschempfindliche Menschen könnten sich von der hellhörigen Wohnung eventuell gestört fühlen. Da ich außerhalb meiner Wohnung immer mit Ohrenstöpseln schlafe,ist dies für mich nicht relevant gewesen.,,,

4275846,71887585,2016-04-29,1448842,Christopher,Location was great! It is loud at night because its above a bar like other reviews have mentioned but its really no louder than other city locations. The building is a little run down but the apartment itself is great.
4275846,72081523,2016-05-01,4443944,Leah & Matt,"Ahmed and Eddie (associate) were easy to communicate with and quick to reply when we were coordinating our arrival.  The neighborhood was as-described.  There is definitely street noise, but this is to be expected in a busy, downtown area.  The studio is in a very convenient location; close to Chinatown and various T stops. It was easy to travel (or walk) around the city."
The studio is a perfect size for two people.  The location of the fridge prevents one from using the oven and makes a tight squeeze to get in front of the stove burners,just FYI in case you are planning on preparing meals using the oven or stove. I did not find any cooking utensils and the only eating utensil was one fork. The handheld shower head was duct-taped and there were some other concerns about cleanliness. We ended up not using the shower during our stay.,,,,
This space would be best for someone who needs a place to crash while in Boston and doesn't plan on preparing their own meals in the studio.,,,,,
Like I said,"Ahmed and Eddie were flexible and great about communicating with us and this is a very convenient location.\"",,,,
4275846,72858464,2016-05-05,16007545,Paul,"We had a great 2-day stay in Ahmed's apartment. Check in was very smooth and professional and the apartment was exactly as presented. Location was awesome in the theatre district in Boston. Everything was clean and quiet (don't know if that was because of the midweek stay, but noise was no issue to us). Highly recommended."
4275846,73397116,2016-05-08,53456192,Titi,Excelente ubicación. Restaurantes cerca. Equipado con todo. Comodo. Difícil subir tres pisos con tantas maletas pero es algo de esperarse en edificios viejos.
4275846,74175807,2016-05-13,28477669,Xiaomin,"Ahmed's place was great. Ahmed's assistant Eddie helped us getting in. He's friendly and considerate. The studio situates at a very convenient location. Steps from the Boylston Street Station and Chinatown. There are so many great food around there. However, there are so many bars around. Thursday night was very crazy and noisy in midnight. If you are looking for somewhere quiet and easy to sleep, this place might not be suitable. In brief, at least I think this is a good choice for me."
4275846,74552002,2016-05-15,8749391,Malaika,No frills studio but with everything we needed in a location that was perfect for a parent showing her 13 year old son Boston for the first time. It gets noisy from the street at night but all of that just added to the urban experience. My son loved the pizza joint next door and ate them out of business! Eddie (our contact) was accommodating and easy to communicate with.
4275846,75024382,2016-05-18,50861161,Mariano,Appt is well located. The building needs a cleaning service.
bathroom is very old and also the bed need to be changed,,,,,
Ahmed employee (Eddie) was great and very helpfull,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4275846,75842674,2016-05-23,11962091,Nick,"Host did not make us feel welcome. They did not reach out to us. After badgering the contact number for two hours after the check in time, we were told someone else was managing the apartment and should have gotten a hold of us. We were worried this was going to be an Airbnb horror story. Eventually the manager called us and was very rude. The bed was miserably uncomfortable and noisy. The blinds barely blocked out any of the light from outside and the room was very loud the whole night. Finally, we were told to check out an hour before the advertised time. This was our first bad airbnb experience."
4275846,76050247,2016-05-24,20938375,Meghan,"This AirBnB is in an amazing location, walking distance from many attractions, restaurants, theaters, etc. and also steps from a T (public transit) station that makes getting around Boston a breeze.  The photos are accurate - the apartment is a small studio and is good as a launching pad to explore the city. To make your stay more convenient, make sure you double check with Ahmed who your point of contact will be for checking in (usually not him) and to make sure you verify the WiFi info before your point of contact leaves the apartment, as we didn't have WiFi for a good part of our stay because of a mix up."
4275846,76256665,2016-05-26,20400283,Mike,Was decent value and convenient in a good location.
4275846,76683410,2016-05-28,7758952,Sabrina,"Ahmed and his associate Eddie were very accommodating about our somewhat late arrival from the airport. Eddie also made time on a Saturday to drop by the place to install a window AC unit. It was much appreciated since it ended up being a hot weekend! Overall the place was nice and decently clean but do keep in mind that it's one of the cheapest places available and in an old building. The mattress was very creaky, the slightest move resulted in a loud noise, and not too comfortable. The bathroom was teeny tiny and showed some wear. We are a little germaphobic so we got cheap flip flops to wear around the place. Also, as others have said, it is very loud. Once we got earplugs we slept just fine. Despite those things, it is super convenient to a metro stop, restaurants, and tourist spots. We went for a run in the morning and were able to hit most notable areas."
4275846,78605924,2016-06-07,40541732,Eric,Great location! It was perfect area for seeing the city and especially close to Boston commons was nice to be able to walk to.
4275846,79994500,2016-06-15,3482359,Katie,"This is a great place right in the heart of it all! Walking distance to almost everything and very convenient to the rail station for trips further afield. It can be a bit noisy, but this is a fine trade off for the location. Clean suite and easy check-in/check-out process."
4275846,80402368,2016-06-18,14641385,Jesse,"The place is OK. Not the best stay I've had in Boston, but I guess for the price, it was worth it. The location is awesome, but the actual apartment could have been a little cleaner and welcoming. As far as check in/out, that part was relatively easy. Overall, I'm not sure I'd stay again, but I guess in a pinch, it would do :)"
4275846,87227154,2016-07-19,66947540,Nicole,"The apartment overall was great - only a minute's walk to the Commons, 15 min to Newbury St, tons of places around to eat and shop. The bed was very creaky but comfortable nonetheless. The bathroom also wasn't completely clean, but only took a few minutes to fix up. Definitely a cute and relaxing place."
4275846,88406620,2016-07-24,29681893,Susana,Great location and walking distance to almost everything.
The apartment is second floor with high stairs and bathroom is very old. Friday night was very noisy all night. If you are looking for somewhere quiet and easy to sleep,this place might not be suitable.,,,,

4275846,88592667,2016-07-24,48688963,Shannon,"This place was in a perfect location. Right in the theater district, a block from the common, and great restaurants! The check in was easy and the place very clean and comfortable. I'd definitely stay here again!"
4275846,91247214,2016-08-04,12327399,Markus,The location is pretty good. The building is old and not in the best condition but the apartment is clean and nice.
"Only the bed is very uncomfortable. It is unstable. The mattress makes lots of noise when lying on her. The light in the bathroom was broken.\"",,,,,
4275846,94383273,2016-08-15,28771644,Leah,"\"The location is great, and we were grateful for the new air conditioner, as we happened to arrive during a real heat wave. The apartment is basically rustic and minimalist, had all the essentials, a few fun decorative touches, and if you want \"\"upscale chic\"\" you should look elsewhere and expect to pay for it. Check the other reviews for specific little grievances; everyone is different in their expectations and tolerance levels (for example"
"We thought it was a fun place.\"",,,,,
4275846,96601160,2016-08-23,56624187,Brian,The location was great :) Bathroom is incredibly tiny. Bed was very uncomfortable. Overall we were happy with our stay!
4275846,98649654,2016-09-01,36820535,Robert,"Our plane arrived very late. We were welcomed at the entrance of the apartment building and let into our room with out complaint or fuss. The room was very clean just like the picture. The building was an old building, but the room had been updated. The location was GREAT. We were within walking distance of everything.. Boston Commons, Chinatown, ...etc. We would definitely recommend this studio."
10671192,75537788,2016-05-22,3180820,Riama,"We had a wonderful 3 nights stay in Nick's apt. The apt was spacious and just like the pictures. We didn't meet Nick but his brother Andy was very responsive via texting. When we arrived at the apt there was only a half roll toilet paper in the bathroom and we told Andy. When we got back to the apartment later, there were 2 bags toilet paper ;-) . He also left a bottle of champagne in the fridge and congratulating us on our son's graduation. Thanks, Andy! The decor and furniture were minimalist, which we liked. No clutter around. Lots of closet spaces and drawers to store our clothes. The kitchen was stocked with nice plates/utensils/cups, pan/pots for cooking, cutting board, trash bags, paper towels. It also had coffee, sugar, salt etc.. We used it to make some breakfast and warm up dinner in the microwave. There was a table with leaves and folding chairs, we used as dining table. The location was perfect. The street was quiet and nice, but there were many restaurants, convenient stores, dunkin donut, coffee shops within 2 blocks. Parking was tricky, it's Boston after all, but if you are patient, you'd find one. There was a parking garage a couple block away which charge $15 from 6AM-6PM or 6PM-6AM. We used it for 1 day since we didn't want to risk being late to the award & graduation ceremonies. There were also some all day parking spots on Columbus Ave and Mass Ave. The metered parking on Tremont Ave is free from 8PM-8AM. We always found a spot around 6-7PM. A few suggestions: the apt needs number on the door and maybe add curtain/blinds to the back door? We definitely will keep Nick's place in mind on our next trip to Boston. Thank you Nick & Andy!"
10671192,75699557,2016-05-22,337512,Jonathan,"Nick's place was great. I used to live in the South End for years and wanted to come back and check out the neighborhood and this was the perfect spot to do so. It's a garden level apartment with access to  a small outdoor space. The place is a generously sized one bedroom for the South End and was well kept and clean. I was traveling with my wife and baby and didn't have any issues with space. Nick was traveling but his brother had come by before we got there and left a six pack in the fridge and made sure our check it was fine. From here you're an easy walk to Back Bay (train and neighborhood) as well as Boylston/Newburystreet and even Downtown Crossing/Faneuil Hall, though you could always take the Orange Line a few blocks away or the 1 bus up to Cambridge.  I would definitely recommend this place."
10671192,76527546,2016-05-28,72955546,Marisha,"\"This was a great place. The location was fantastic and the apartment was both clean and spacious.

Excellent communication and very accommodating. I wish every airbnb experience was as smooth and enjoyable as this one."
10671192,78326699,2016-06-06,8479265,Alejandro,Nick was a superb host! He was prompt to respond when exchanging communication and he also was kind enough to let us check in a little early.
The apartment was spacious,clean and very comfortable,but nothing beats the location; the apartment is located in a prime neighborhood on a beautiful and quiet street. Nick also has some great recommendations for local restaurants and shops.,,,
"I highly recommend it\"",,,,,
10671192,78693938,2016-06-08,56848248,Glen,This three-night stay in Boston was our first experience with Airbnb and it was certainly a positive initiation.  We found Nick’s apartment to be clean and very comfortable.  Information on the website was accurate and Nick was very responsive to our text requests.  We usually received a response within a few minutes.  One time took close to 15 minutes for which he was unnecessarily very apologetic.
The apartment is located on the ground floor of a brownstone on a beautiful,tree-lined street.  Most of the people we saw on the street were 20 or 30-somethings and the neighborhood impressed us as being very quiet and safe.  Nick recommended a new restaurant a couple of blocks from the apartment which we found to be very good.,,,,
Although the only “cooking” we did was making coffee,the kitchen was adequately equipped for meal preparation.  The only negative we have to report is the lack of washcloths and bath soap.  Other towels and shampoo and conditioner were available.,,,,
The two full days we spent in Boston were rather warm,sunny skies with highs in the 80’s.  The apartment did get pretty warm during the daytime but we were unable to adjust the thermostat to cool it off.  It was not a major issue so we did not mention it to our host at all.  In hindsight we realized that the apartment probably has only central heat,not A/C.  As we were packing to leave we noticed what appeared to be a portable A/C in the closet.  It is possible that it could have been made available if we had only asked.,,,
We recommend this listing highly.,,,,,

10671192,80268180,2016-06-17,30502162,Abhishek,We had a wonderful stay at this apartment. Nick was a great host. He responded to any questions or comments I had throughout the visit very quickly. He also had a lot of great recommendations for things to do in the area. The apartment itself was very spacious and clean. It is located in a great area. There are tons of options for restaurants and shops. Public transportation is located nearby so it was very easy to access the rest of Boston.

10671192,83046068,2016-07-01,2509279,John,"In a word, perfect.  Great location, roomy apartment, clean and tidy.  Great neighborhood with a real community feel.  Walk to stores, restaurants, trails, the T, etc.  Nick was prompt, courteous, and clear in his communications.  Very helpful.  Stayed only two nights but wish we had found this place earlier. We have overpaid for too many hotel nights visiting the area (we have a son at NEU) and this would have been a much better alternative.  Would definitely stay here again."

The washer & driver were a great convenience! We failed to realize that there was only an AC window unit in the bedroom and the living room was warm and at times uncomfortable. Also, the apt. was on the bottom floor and it felt like walking into a dungeon. We were unable to open the back door, not sure if it was operator error. Despite these minor things, it was still a GREAT experience!!!! It was the neighborhood that won us over! It was really safe and central to everything! The buildings were sooooo beautiful! There were really cool coffee shops & restaurants near by!"

I made this account just to find a place in Boston because the hotels near downtown were too expensive. We were walking distance to the train and only a few stops away from downtown.

I saw the pictures online and the place looked exactly the same in person . The apartment is located very close to downtown about a 10 min train ride . The train station was very close about a 5 min walk . Sergei was accessible via phone and text for needs . For my first air bnb experience it was golden. The home was clean and felt welcoming .

The house is just as described: very clean, spacious and homey.  It can easily fit up to five people comfortably (we were three, with two no the queen size bed, and one of us on the queen size air mattress, but the couch is comfortable enough to sleep on also).  I felt like I was home, and the neighborhood is really clean and quaint also.  Not to mention that there's a beach only a few blocks away.   Moreover, we were mostly driving around so it was perfect that we had a private parking lot.  Unfortunately, we didn't get to use the subway system, but while walking we easily found it only a few blocks away."

The house is clean , beautiful and conveniently located, only two minutes' walk from the subway.

205894,1094628,2012-04-07,982665,Bart,"My experience is based on a 1 night stay in room D. The house was lovely and the room was spacious and clean. You share the kitchen, bathroom, living room, ... with Hermina and other guests. Hermina was very friendly, helpful and nice to talk to. One minor issue might be that you can't seem to lock your room on the outside."

205894,2094790,2012-08-25,1593230,Jim,"I had a nice stay at Hermina's house in Dorchester. It is a big beautiful house with close access to the subway. The room was large, clean, and comfortable (nice big bed!).  There was a ceiling fan in the room but it got a bit stuffy on hotter days. Hermina was a nice and welcoming host. There is not much in the immediate neighborhood so the close access to the subway is essential (about 20 mins to get to South Station downtown). If you don't mind staying away from the center of town, it's a great deal."
205894,2163617,2012-09-01,2783389,Ralph,It was a good place to stay. Bed was comfortable. I also could park my car on the street. Hermina the host is nice and helpful in questions about the area.

While we did not have the opportunity to chat a lot she provided a very clean, comfortable and welcoming place to stay. We were able to come and go as we pleased without feeling like we were intruding. The shared space was clean and while we did not use the kitchen there was access to everything you could want. The location is great as you are a short journey to central Boston and we felt safe at all times. Many thanks for a lovely stay, Amy"
205894,2454285,2012-09-30,2029329,Nadine,"Hermina is a very friendly host. The house is indeed beautiful, the atmosphere friendly and open. I would stay there again, if I visited Boston again."

Hermina is a very sweet and accommodating lady, and although I wasn't around much due to 12 hour+ commitments elsewhere, I felt very comfortable in her home when I was there."
205894,2976014,2012-11-26,2534028,Mengqiu,"A very good place to stay either for short time or long vacation. The room is clean and neat just as it's descripted. Since we are in a very tight schdule for the tour, we have no time to talk with Hermina, but she is nice. Anyway, We had a great thanksgiving though Boston is so so so so much cold at this time.

The location is EXCELLENT, just a few minutes' walk to the Fields Corner station on the Red Line. My room was spacious and clean, and the whole atmosphere is relaxed and casual. I definitely would stay again!"
205894,5445001,2013-06-30,3255965,Greg,Large clean room in a big house.  Hermina was very quick to provide me with information on how to get in.
PLEASE NOTE - Their is no air conditioner in the room that I stayed in.  Not sure if all rooms are like that,"but please keep that in mind if it's really hot out or you are the type of person that needs AC to sleep.\"",,,,

Room was lovely and the house itself is ideally located only a few minutes from the T which runs direct into downtown Boston. Great local food options too. Would definitely stay here again."
205894,6029813,2013-07-27,7227959,Nancy,"Hermina was very nice.  This large house was really used more as a boarding house with many, many guests.  I was disappointed that the parking I needed was on the streets.  This is a loud, though safe, neighborhood."
205894,6062908,2013-07-28,7702884,Lauren,"The house itself was nice and clean, but I'd sent Hermina several emails prior to arriving with questions and she didn't reply to me until after we had stayed there. She was out of town so we didn't meet her. It might have been different had she been home, but for us visiting it was frustrating because we didn't have all the information that we needed."
205894,6123181,2013-07-30,2726945,Nicholas,This was my second time staying here. It was comfortable and convenient. It's easy to come and go as you please. I will stay here again.
205894,6167715,2013-08-01,6515046,Guillaume,The house is really well located outside of Boston but really close to the subway.
Really good international cheap food all around.,,,,,

205894,6833826,2013-08-26,8242872,Shan,"This is the first experience i had with airbnb, and thanks Hermina my boyfriend and i had a really great time. Hermina's house is very near to the subway read line. Though at first i had a little concern about the area as it doesn't look that decent, then i was feeling safe when i saw it is right next to the police station. And the house looks warm, one thing i liked about it is i can go to the kitchen and look for snacks when i feel hungry at night, that just feels like home. So what i really want to say is if you are not a high maintenance person you would love Hermina's house."
205894,6888019,2013-08-28,8191494,Saehwang,Hermina's place was so nice that I made a second visit. Had a pleasant stay at a beautiful room!

205894,7152123,2013-09-08,138965,Emeline,We had a very nice stay at Hermina's home.
Dorchester is not as famous as Cambridge or others suburbs of Boston but Hermina's home is really well located. The red line (very closed to the house) brings you downtown in 15 min.,,,,,
The house(s) is big and they are rooms everywhere. Ours,with a king size bed,was very confortable. Finally,hermina is a very sweet personne who will love to have a coffee with you if you want to speak about Boston,life,"or any subject \""
205894,7291700,2013-09-14,8712049,Elise,"We stayed at Hermina's house for 3 very happy days. She is very nice and mild,we had her delicious homemade apple pie for breakfast,her house is nice  and beautiful, we really enjoyed stay there."

205894,7459407,2013-09-21,7675421,Christian,Hermina was very kind and always help us quickly if we had any questions. We liked eating at the Vietnamese place close by. We've slept downstairs so some nights got a little noisy if there were a lot of guests staying at one time.
205894,7600737,2013-09-26,7836190,Brad,"I enjoyed my trip in Boston and had a great AirBnB experience staying with Hermina. It was great visiting with her and other guests staying in the house. My room (D) was clean, comfortable and a good size."

205894,8258524,2013-10-22,8975865,Debbie,"The room was ok, host friendly.  The main thing is the location. Close to train station with easy access into Boston.  You can walk from the house to several eating establishments (mostly some type of Asian like Thai or Chinese food). There's also a grocery store a block or so away, and a library (for free internet access)."

Hermina makes several rooms available through AirBnb,"and the other guests were considerate and great people to talk to. Her thoughtfulness even includes leaving the kitchen stocked with breakfast food for guests.  Thanks for making such a warm environment!\"",,,,
205894,8864775,2013-11-22,13801,Marina,"Hermina's house is huge, clean, and quiet. There are many rooms within the house that are rented out through AirBnB, however, I almost never saw or heard anyone. This was perfect for me as I came to Boston for interviews and to work on my thesis for a couple of days. The kitchen area is perfect to cook for yourself and they provide lots of ingredients for a tasty breakfast. Both Hermina and Donna are helpful, nice, and quick to respond to inquiries. The area around the house may seem a bit sketchy, but I never felt unsafe because there are usually lots of people and cars around. Furthermore, the Red Line train is 2 blocks away, which takes you directly to downtown Boston in 20 min. Thanks!"
205894,9307862,2013-12-20,8245353,Angely,"My boyfriend & I enjoyed our stay at Hermina's beautiful home. Thank you very much. Donna was very helpful, and was very quick to respond to any questions or concerns. We stayed in room D and it was  was nice roomy and clean."

Friendly atmosphere in the house with other lovely guests and especially Donna, Herminas helper, did everything to fullfill our wishes. I can just recommend this place for a stay at Boston."
205894,10253270,2014-02-09,6185073,Ngozi,"Lovely house, clean and roomy. The only problem I had was checking in. The bed in my room had obviously been slept in and sheets weren't changed. I tried calling Hermina only to find out that her number is an international number and I tried calling Donna the caretaker but kept getting her voicemail. I had to send an email and eventually got a response. It all got straightened out but that meant I was late for my meeting etc"
Other than that,"I enjoyed my stay\"",,,,

205894,13806635,2014-06-04,15856042,Vanessa,Hermina is a wonderful host. We needed a place to stay until our apartment is ready to move in. Hermina and Donna have made our stay very enjoyable. The only bit of down side is the apt could be really warm in the summer and we could not figure out our the AC work.
205894,14765268,2014-06-25,15770950,Thomas & Stefanie,"We haven't met Hermina, but everything was arranged perfectly. We booked just 30 minutes in advance and called Hermina. She send us an email with further instructions. We had room D, a very nice and large room. The house was located close to the T, so it was easy to get to the center of Boston (about 20min).

205894,15563578,2014-07-11,3789046,Cameron,The room was exactly what we wanted - clean and in a convenient location to the train into downtown. We were on a road trip from NYC to Montreal and needed place where we could park our rental car plus on a budget - this ticked both boxes.
"The building is pleasant and feels homely.\"",,,,,
205894,16035908,2014-07-20,17791295,Eric,We had a great stay in Hermina's home. The house is very nice and also spacious. The description is accurate. I drove my car during our stay and found parking near the house with little difficulty. I also used the public transportation and the rail system is only a couple of blocks from the house. This was very convenient. If I came to the area again I would stay here.
205894,16922521,2014-08-04,17148237,Sarah,"My boyfriend and I visited Boston for the first time , and decided to stay here for four days. For the most part it was everything we needed, it was clean, and we had a very comfy bed.. but I would give any other guests a heads up about the neighborhood. Its not the slums , but it's a place you don't want to hang around at night for example walking to or from T station (which is right down the street, a HUGE PLUS), keep in mind if your a light sleeper and there are other people staying in the house you can hear them walking around the house . I would give the experience 3.8 out of 5 stars . Not bad ."
205894,17108967,2014-08-07,1591034,Janet,Everything was as described on the listing.  The house assistant was there when I checked in and made sure that my room was in perfect shape.  The neighborhood was quiet for a large city.  There is a McDonalds within 2 minutes for breakfast and evening snacks.  The T station is also close and convenient for travel to downtown.

The place was very nicely kept, clean, warm and homey, including the kitchen which was stoked with things for a small breakfast."
My only issue,and it was quite an issue for me,is that the surrounding neighborhood is very sketchy as some people pointed out. I was not comfortable at all to walk outside in the evening. If you are looking for a place to park your car out and go straight in,that would be good for you. If you are looking for a place that you could walk around a bit in the evening,"I think that would be a bit uncomfortable for most.\"",

Guests hve shared bathroom and kitchen privileges -  be sure to clean up after yourself and remove your shoes inside.  There is a TV in the living room.  The house is an old restored Victorian in a busy, eclectic neighborhood that is undergoing some renewal.  You'll get a front door code as well as a key to your room so you can come and go as you wish.  I felt quite safe."
"I parked my rental car on the street near the house and took the subway to explore Boston.  The \"\"T\"\" is a quick 2 blocks away and very easy to use.  Be sure to grab a free map of Boston from the airport or an info kiosk as they have maps of the \"\"T\"\"",the city and the Freedom Trail as well as tons of other great stuff.,,,,
The house is near a fairly busy street so there is some road noise,especially during the day.  There is a Police substation behind the house so you'll hear some sirens but the trade off is an added sense of security.   Since I was traveling alone and unfamiliar with the neighborhood,I chose not to walk around outside after dark.,,,
There are restaurants and shops nearby.  I had a great dinner at the Vietnamese restaurant on the corner.,,,,,
The host,Hermina,was friendly and helpful.  We enjoyed talking over coffee or tea.  Be sure you have her cell number in case you need to contact her.,,,

La metro è davvero a pochi minuti e in poche fermate si arriva in centro a Boston. il quartiere è ben fornito di tutti i servizi e molto sicuro. In generale un'esperienza che consiglierei e sicuramente ripeterei!"
205894,30056237,2015-04-16,4871438,Yunji,"Room D was booked on short notice, but Hermina graciously accepted! The house, room, and bathroom were all very spacious and clean. It was also within close walking distance to the Red Line and good restaurants and convenience stores. It is a communal house, so be prepared for the presence of other guests and possible noise as they are going about their own business during the day or night. Overall a great value, very convenient and comfortable, thank you Hermina!"
205894,31677977,2015-05-08,14041306,Courtney,"Hermina's Victorian home is lovely. She was not there during my stay, however, and so I had to be pretty independent, which I do not mind. There were other guests there (I could hear them) but we did not cross paths much at all. The location is very convenient to the Red Line which is a big plus. The neighborhood is quiet and quaint with a couple restaurants within a block or 2."
Making sure the house manager is there to answer questions or give a tour would have been nice. We ran out of toilet paper and I had no idea where to get more. I also think another guest brought home fresh (straight from the sea,still alive??) fish the first night,so for about 18 hours the entire house smelled of dead fish - very,very unpleasant. Another guest continuously left the toilet seat up. Every single time. A house manager could have helped remedy these situation where it may be uncomfortable for another guest to rectify it. Also,because the doors are controlled with a code entry,I wasn't sure how safe it was.  I did lock myself out of the bedroom unknowingly and had to contact Hermina to figure out how to get back in. She was very responsive and told me where the keys were. Still
The room I stayed in (room D) was gorgeous,"clean and very comfortable. I spent my time in the home in my little oasis (the room) and found my self most satisfied there. I would recommend Hermina's place with the full disclosure above. \"",,,,
205894,32833638,2015-05-22,22560569,Cecilia,"It was an enjoyable stay! I stayed for 3 nights and Hermina was very responsive to my questions. It was just minutes away from the T- line and very convenient to the downtown area! The location was also easy to find. The neighbourhood was also safe to walk. However, as I was travelling alone, I went back during early evening. Overall, it was a wonderful and enjoyable stay!"
205894,34325461,2015-06-07,20133757,Lei,"Room D is very comfortable, and Hermina is very nice. The location of the house is about 5 min to T- Red Line, it's convenient. We like it."
205894,34739666,2015-06-11,34774862,Paul,Very welcome. Nice little place. Nice beds.
205894,36342664,2015-06-27,9372946,Kevin,"We enjoyed our stay in Boston thanks to Hermina's friendly and helpful hospitality, as well as the convenient location. The nearby T train transit station made it very easy to get where we were going, all the major spots most visitors would want to see. Recommended!"
"\"",,,,,
205894,37046379,2015-07-04,12191731,Sarah,"Hermina was a gracious host and gave us really helpful directions to her flat! Four of us booked rooms B and D. The rooms were true to the photographs and, happily, only a few minutes' walk from Field's Corner T-station, as well as from McDonald's and a supermarket. Coin-operated laundry available downstairs! Do note that both rooms got some noise from both within and outside the house, and the one shower seems to be shared by all the tenants."
205894,38640937,2015-07-17,21007414,Paulina,"The home and room were as described. Very close to the subway and stores to pick up basic essentials. It is located in a very rough neighbourhood, so we made sure to get home before 8pm. I wouldn't feel comfortable walking around at night by myself, but it was ok with my partner. The home is located in front of a police station which came with siren-noise but also an added sense of security when sleeping at night."
205894,39832339,2015-07-26,38151474,Léonard,Nous avons eu un séjour très agréable dans cette très belle maison. Bien placée à 2 pas de la station de métro pour rejoindre le centre de Boston et aussi très proche de l'interstate. Nous vous la recommandons chaudement!
205894,40504346,2015-07-31,7862731,Nanan,"Well, the house is located close to subway, 3 mins walk to subway, the room D doesn't have air conditioning, and it was like 34 celcius degrees, so imagine the heat, it was like living hell, couldn't  breathe, and it was too noisy, loud vehicle and motors sound kept waking us"
205894,41100267,2015-08-04,34900134,Cindy,Good location. Convenient to anywhere. The room D is big enough. The kitchen is big and equipped with all the things that need. But the room and the shared bathroom could be made more clean.
205894,41636037,2015-08-08,4473611,Christina,Nice apartment and good location...
205894,45622256,2015-09-04,42194484,Roberta,Herminia è una persona accogliente stupenda e disponibile la sua casa è pulita grande e lei mette ha disposizione tutto ciò che ha in cucina. La colazione buona.
205894,45841198,2015-09-06,41659097,Shiqi,"The room is very spacious and clean, so is the bathroom, clean bath towels are provided. During my stay, the weather is very warm, I don't know if the room has AC or not, I had to keep the fan running all night, and the traffic is a little loud in late night. The neighborhood doesn't look safe walking around, so better get home before it's late."
205894,47073389,2015-09-15,1248138,George,The room was excellent and everything I expected. The house is close to the subway line and made going to and from Boston very easy. I would return here again if I return to Boston.
205894,47401997,2015-09-18,41970626,Laura,"Hermina is really nice, and she provided the details to go to her house. The house is clean and comfortable. I like here. Besides, it is very convinient."
205894,47802092,2015-09-21,43297705,Andrew,"Clean, and comfy. Very convenient for public transport. Highly recommended."
205894,49285473,2015-10-02,44875886,Andreas,"Hermina was always a very kind and helpful host. No matter if just for a nice conversation or a short walk along the coast. If you need help or miss something, just ask. Even if not at home, Hermina will usually answer immediately."
The house itself is equipped with everything you need to feel comfy. Very clean and nicely decorated. Not quite downtown Boston but very close (5 min) to the next T-station. Some good and affordable restaurants are just around the corner. There is also a coffee shop and supermarket in close vicinity.,,,,,
If I will ever have the opportunity to be in Boston again,"I would stay at Hermina's house again.\"",,,,
205894,49799285,2015-10-06,43063776,Alessio,"\"The place is very nice. The house is close to the metro and rooms are quite confortable. Unfortunately I didn't have the chance to spend so much time with Hermina but she welcomed us the day we came and she was always nice to us. The only \"\"bad\"\" thing is the fact the there no so many bathrooms and then when the house is full it is not easy to find the shower free.\""
205894,50495999,2015-10-12,43900305,Richard,"\"Hermina was responsive to all my texts.  I had a nice large shared room and I shared a clean full bathroom with, I think, 2 or 3 other people and I never had to wait. I believe someone \"\"sits\"\" the house but she was at the premises everyday. Dorchester is a great place to see Boston because it is a good neighborhood"
205894,51051498,2015-10-17,45050062,Hee Nam,"My room and facility are perfect, location with subway is excellent."
205894,51286267,2015-10-19,3357543,Luca,Hermina non era presente in casa ma ci ha lasciato indicazioni molto dettagliate per poter accedere e soggiornare senza problemi.
Si è dimostrata molto disponibile e rapida nel soddisfare le nostre richieste via email e sms.,,,,,
La casa è molto ben tenuta,una sorta di ostello con 5/6 camere e 2 bagni in comune,buona la pulizia.,,,
Abbiamo trovato però la nostra camera un po troppo fredda,senza la possibilità di poterla riscaldare adeguatamente.,,,,
La vicinanza con la metro (3 minuti a piedi) la rende molto comoda per raggiungere il centro di Boston in circa 20 minuti.,,,,,
Unico neo a mio avviso è il quartiere (Dorchester),che pur se descritto come sicuro a noi non lo è sembrato affatto,cosa poi confermata facendo qualche ricerca online (diversi i reati gravi in zona). Entrambe le sere siamo dovuti rientrare a passo svelto a causa delle persone non rassicuranti ferme alla stazione della metro e lungo strada.,,,
Questo ci ha impedito di godere appieno del soggiorno,non sentendoci di fatto molto al sicuro al rientro la sera.,,,,
"In definitva un ottimo alloggio in una zona però non eccelsa.\"",,,,,
205894,52352409,2015-10-28,46310845,Jan,"Das Haus ist gut ausgestattet, die Vermietung der Zimmer ist gut durchorganisiert. An den wichtigen Stellen finden sich Zettel mit Hinweisen fuer Uebernachtungsgaeste. Insgesamt werden 5 Zimmer vermietet. Der Kuehlschrank und Kuechengeraete koennen verwendet werden."
Beim beschriebenen kostenlosen Parkplatz ist zu beachten,dass montags jeweils auf einer Strassenseite Parkverbot herrscht,auf der anderen konnten wir uns am Sonntagabend mit Glueck den letzten Parkplatz sichern.,,,
Hermina haben wir nicht persoenlich getroffen,sie hat sich aber aeusserst engagiert um uns ueber die Nachrichten-Funktion gekuemmert.,,,,
Die Polizeiwache direkt nebenan hat uns nachts nicht gestoert. Das Haus liegt sehr nah an der U-Bahn und an Einkaufsmoeglichkeiten. Allerdings ist es eine Gegend,"in der wir uns nicht so recht wohl und sicher gefuehlt haben.\"",,,,
205894,52548466,2015-10-30,42735201,Jerry,This is a fancy house and room D is big and clean. The description of landlord is accurate. We took a great two days there.
205894,53121950,2015-11-05,44894624,Pechpilai,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
205894,53138366,2015-11-05,1800161,Shirley,"Beautiful house with fabulous polished hardwood floors. Large nicely furnished room with a comfortable bed. It's really easy to take public transport to Boston city centre. Street parking is OK unless it's a Monday when one side has to be kept clear for street cleaning. Also, don't park within 10 feet of the fire hydrant (I found that info on Boston City website)."
Communication: Information about the house could have been clearer. We were really confused about the kitchen arrangements.  It wasn't clear what is free to use and what is personal. Also,"the washing machine and tumble dryer in the upstairs bathroom had stickers saying \"\"Not Working\"\"",yet other guests were using them.... why?? We never met Hermina or the house manager Donna. The listing mentions a laundry room in the basement,but the basement now seems to be a bedroom.,,
Cleanliness: Guests kept the bathroom clean,"but the kitchen bins were never emptied during our three night stay. \"",,,,
205894,53407760,2015-11-08,32092932,Tracy,"The description, directions, and location are spot on. We knew what to expect and everything was as it was presented. The T line is about 3 blocks away - very convenient. The room is spacious and the bed is comfy, too.  We enjoyed being there."
205894,54385006,2015-11-19,24641086,琳,Very comfortable staying. Big room. The house is in good maintenance. I enjoyed the stay.
205894,57236995,2015-12-23,12479309,JuanCarlos,"Great room to stay! I really rested in that room, plus it was quiet enough that you could sleep in if need be and privacy was never an issue. Hermina was very friendly and sharing which made it even better! I recommend staying here."
205894,68610325,2016-04-05,1890776,Anja,"Very lovely house, 5min from T-Station, then ca. 10min to downtown Boston. Communication with Hermina went well, we met her shortly and she was nice and always responsive to our dialogue. Room is nice and big, unfortunately not much place to store things. Kitchen was unfortunately a bit a mess- not sure if that was from other Airbnb People that stayed there."
"In any case a good Option for a couple of days in Boston where you get all you Need.\"",,,,,
205894,71269213,2016-04-24,56421491,Gabrielle,We had a lovely time in Boston. Hermina was a great hostess and we really enjoyed our stay. We would love to stay here again in the future!
205894,74549148,2016-05-15,69374874,Marcia,Hermina was a very helpful and considerate hostess. Her home is the ideal location for a guest. It's a stones throw from the public rails and finding parking wasn't a problem. The rooms and linens were clean and neat. I had a restful stay and would gladly book again when visiting.
205894,76129643,2016-05-25,73362730,Patrick,Lovely room. Very accommodating of my late night arrival. Kept in contact throughout the day to make sure my needs were met! Would definitely stay again!
205894,78916906,2016-06-10,46694342,Charles,"Very gracious and worldly, made me feel hip and welcome. The decor is a nice mix of homey and modern. Ocean breezes from nearby bay made this a really delightful place to stay. Family was staying in upstairs room while I was there, we all got along fine"
205894,81787110,2016-06-25,78339955,Patrick,Great location for availability of transit and community resources.  Beautiful house with all amenities.
205894,82655857,2016-06-28,14497895,Anna,"Upon arrival, we found out that Hermina's assistant, Juan, had deliberately given our room away to another guest who wanted a bigger room and lied about it. However, once we got Hermina on the phone, everything was straightened out and the rest of our stay went smoothly. The house is located in a good area with easy access to public transportation, highways, and an abundance of free parking. The room was clean and cozy and the old house had lots of charm. I would recommend the house for anyone looking to stay in a beautiful Victorian for that Boston experience. Just make sure to have your email confirmation handy."
205894,83801802,2016-07-04,73617296,Chase,Was perfect! Couldn't be in a better location in regards to the train. Made our trip affordable and loved it.
205894,84206618,2016-07-06,1991490,Carol,Hermina let us know ahead of time that she wouldn't be there during our stay.  Our room was spacious and comfortable. The shared bathroom was down the hall. It was easy to make coffee and toast in the kitchen each morning.
205894,87076467,2016-07-18,16991738,Maren,"We had a really nice stay at Hermina*s house. The room was quite big, the bed.was comfy and public transport is right around the corner. AC would have been nice though, as it was quite hot in Boston."
205894,88489382,2016-07-24,7235521,Volodymyr,Room is great. Close to transport. A little bit noisy street.
205894,89566521,2016-07-29,56584727,Remi,Really nice experience. The room was ready very early. Everything was clean in the house. The room we had was very nice with a lot of windows. The parking was in the street and there was a lot of free spaces. Hermina was very nice With us.

205894,93353195,2016-08-12,7265307,Thomas,"Hermina is a perfect host and very supportiv. The house has several bedrooms to accomodate a number of guests the same time, which gives the opportunity to encounter and get in contact to other guests, which i experienced very positive."
14592547,98353488,2016-08-30,52423782,Leslie,"This is a great place to stay if you're planning on traveling into Boston. There are lots of little shops and restaurants nearby, if you're not planning on going to Boston. We stayed during college move-in day, so the town was pretty busy, but we were able to find parking with no problem. The subway into Boston is only a short walk away. Sofia and Kim's apartment was really beautiful, the room we stayed in was super organized and clean. We met Kim during check in, and she was really kind and personable. I'm really glad we chose this apartment!"
14592547,98960438,2016-09-02,90516803,Muhammed,"I stayed there for couple of days. Sofia was away, but Kim was there and walked me through the apt when I arrived. Couple of times I had questions afterwards, and she was available via text (responded spontaneously). Also, I asked if I can keep my luggage in their place the day I was leaving, and pick them up at night later. Kim was very helpful regarding this, and saved me from a lot of hustle. I'll definitely recommend their place to anybody looking for a friendly host, clean house, and great neighborhood."

5783197,30413277,2015-04-21,23487713,Christopher,I can't say enough about our experience at Lisa's property.  She was amazingly pleasant and accommodating.  The neighborhood is so beautifully preserved/restored that its like a living museum.  Hipster-chic restaurants and shops are literally right around the corner on Tremont and Shawmut.  We parked our car on arrival and didn't need to use it until we left.
The property is tastefully maintained but still practical.  The kitchen is well furnished,the bathrooms are clean and modern.  Overall,the apartment reminds you that your are in the charming South End but has everything you need in 2015.,,,
We were in Boston for the marathon and the property is perfectly situated as a short walk from the start pickup and the finish.  We mostly walked everywhere but used the nearby mass transit.,,,,,
"I can't recommend this property or Lisa more highly.\"",,,,,
5783197,30838337,2015-04-27,31628908,邢,Enjoyed our stay at Lisa's place. She's such a good host. Everything  is better than we expected. It's our  first stay in United States first time use airbnb . It was such a pleasure. Actually apt  looks more spacious than the picture shows.  Feels like a home for all six of us. Lisa gave us are really welcome  with all the food snacks and everything you need .  We will dedicate stay here  if we visit Boston again .
"Thank you so much Lisa for everything \"",,,,,
5783197,32034252,2015-05-12,19232809,Monte,"Where to begin...Lisa is an absolutely wonderful host!  Not only did she cover my a$$, but she made us feel right at home...I was without a  place to stay after 2 failed attempts to book places that were not available after I made bookings.  Lisa pre-approved me and was able to accommodate us the same day that we were arriving!  To our elite, she even bought us some groceries...class act!  The beautiful brownstone was better that described and was so wonderful and clean...made us feel right at home.  The neighborhood is great with lots of restaurants and shops all within walking distance.  Great place, great host, great stay...I can't wait to go back!  Thanks Lisa!"
5783197,32350405,2015-05-17,17577593,Alana,The home and neighbourhood were even more beautiful than pictured! Lisa made us feel very welcome by greeting us on arrival and remaining in touch throughout our stay.
5783197,33508082,2015-05-29,30703827,Sheri,"Our host made us feel extremely welcome.  She provided lots of travel information and extras. Her place was as beautiful as it looked in the pictures.   It was very clean. Wonderful neighborhood in Boston and we had everything we needed for our stay.  So much nicer than staying in a hotel.   Three grown children and my husband and I had all the space we needed.  I can recommend this place without reservation.  If I ever go back to Boston, I would stay here again.  The host and place far exceeded our expectations.  I wouldn't  change one thing."
5783197,34213008,2015-06-06,32080080,Casey,"Lisa made our entire team feel so welcome, as we arrived for a 2-day work trip - bottle of wine, snacks and an inviting space was a nice alternative to our typical hotel stay while in Boston."
The space is amazing - was a perfect fit for our team to call as a home base,with just a short walk to our office at John Hancock Tower. The neighborhood was lovely,and although working most of the day into the night,"we enjoyed exploring a bit to/from the office.\"",,
5783197,34716898,2015-06-11,7195599,Kelly,"Lisa's place is gorgeous and charming. And so is Lisa! I stayed there along with 2 colleagues in leu of the more pricey (and not nearly as lovely) Westin, where our conference was located. It was an easy 5 min walk to the hotel and the place is minutes from everything you need. Lisa was kind and made everything very simple. Her place is stocked with amenities, and welcomed us with a gift basket of goodies and great information and maps. So grateful we made this decision to stay at her place!"
5783197,35219150,2015-06-16,26491582,Kevin,"Our experience in Boston was  so special and it all started with this lovely apartment and our host, Lisa.  Not only was the brownstone beautiful, updated and well-cared for, but Lisa also provided so many extras to make our stay comfortable. Plush towels, soaps, shampoos and lotions, a little gift basket of local favorites and goodies and some essentials in the refrigerator - to name a few.  Lastly, the location in Boston's trendy South End is excellent. We highly recommend this home for your next stay in Boston."
5783197,36681880,2015-06-30,723831,Steve,"We stayed in Lisa's lovely place in Boston for a family wedding. We were pleasantly surprised at every turn. Lisa was easy to deal with and totally flexible about our arrival and departure times. The neighborhood was fantastic, and the place was even better than we expected based on the description and others reviews. We would stay there again in a heartbeat if our travels took us to Boston again."
5783197,38838069,2015-07-19,8914291,Jessica,"I almost want to write a bad review so no one will stay here and it will always be available when we come to Boston. That is just how great it is! Tons of space, everything updated, incredible neighborhood (we used to live in the South End and this is in a wonderful location). Lisa even had baby gates, neighborhood maps with all the wonderful playgrounds pinpointed, a kid-friendly welcome basket, and space in the foyer to keep our stroller so no lugging it up and down stairs (that is HUGE, people). Thank you, Lisa! We would love to come back if you will have us!"

5783197,43228841,2015-08-18,34208802,Karen,My family and I enjoyed the stay at 159 Canton Street.  It was within walking distance to many shops and resturants.  The house was lovely and Lisa was a very nice host and supplied us with travel guides for sites around Boston.  The house was very clean and there were plenty of bath towels for the 5 of us.  We would definitely consider staying here night year if we decide to visit Boston.
5783197,43961728,2015-08-23,38172257,Alessandro,"Lisa was an incredible host since the beginning. She made herself available and answered all my questions. The apartment is incredible, just like the pictures, and the location is great. My family had a wonderful time and we are looking forward to stay here again in the future."
5783197,44574979,2015-08-27,9047031,Christine,My family and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Lisa's stunning South End apartment which meets the highest standards. It is conveniently located with restaurants and shops close by and public transport only a few blocks away. Lisa is an excellent communicator with impressive organizational skills. Even though she was on a trip and with us on the move Lisa organised for someone to meet us at her house to let us in and show us around. Lisa really thought of everything we could possibly need to get settled in and to make our stay as comfortable as possible. We would definitely consider staying at Lisa's very beautiful and spacious apartment again if our travels took us back to Boston.
5783197,45147236,2015-08-31,40215540,Alison,"We really enjoyed our stay at Lisa's home. We were made welcome from the time we arrived to the time we left. Whilst Lisa was away when we arrived, she had arrange for Kelly to greet us,  and also ensured that detailed maps were provided for local restaurants and shops. The personal touches made it feel like an easy place to be. The apartment's location was idea for exploring Boston. We had a lovely city break. Many thanks"

The property itself is stupendous. Modern,clean,and extremely comfortable. The location is absolutely perfect - a short walk to coffee shops,restaurants,and more! Boston is a small city and with this home being in Boston's South End,you feel like a local and can walk to nearly everywhere. From this location
"100% recommend this property!\"",,,,,
5783197,48928979,2015-09-29,11110707,Diane,Lisa was waiting on the stoop when we arrived.   She even sent detailed instructions on how to enter in the off-chance that we would arrive before she returned from an appointment.  She simplified the parking for us - but there is absolutely no reason to need a vehicle while staying in her lovely home. The location is walkable for all the South End shops and restaurants and ubers are convenient for other areas.  The home was immaculate and well appointed.  Could not ask for a more perfect stay or a lovelier host.
5783197,52492581,2015-10-30,14411276,Adam,Beautiful place and well (URL HIDDEN) on Boston and the local area was very helpful!

Her home was equally impressive - warm, spacious, great location, and beautiful.  I won't rephrase the description on her ad, but an exceptional place to stay for a group staying in Boston."
5783197,54991278,2015-11-27,33499794,Itai,"Wow! This place was fabulous! Beautiful, perfect location, spotless, Lisa was a terrific host. Definitely coming back."
5783197,55450747,2015-12-01,47992344,Cabieses,"Nos encantó quedarnos en la propiedad de Lisa. Está en una calle tranquila, muy bien amoblada, es confortable y muy limpia. Queda a pocas cuadras de la estación del subterráneo o del centro comercial. Lisa respondía nuestras preguntas rápidamente via msg. La pasamos realmente bien !"
5783197,56127885,2015-12-09,32080080,Casey,"Yet another amazing stay at Lisa's beautiful place in the South End! With our team flying in from different parts of the country and having multiple days of meetings - this was the perfect place near our Boston office to rest each night and over the weekend. Perfect location, beautiful at the holidays and the brownstone is so warm and inviting - home away from home!"
5783197,69413573,2016-04-11,397617,Anne-Marie,This is a very nice place to stay at a top location to explore Boston.  Lisa is an excellent host.
5783197,73412761,2016-05-08,48465147,Linda,"If you want a beautiful neighborhood, elegant and comfortable home, gracious and welcoming host, this is your place.  Great location and a delightful way to visit Boston for our daughters' graduation."
5783197,74485753,2016-05-15,65456669,Chris,"Lisa was a great host.  She was waiting for us when we arrived (late) from the airport and she was very welcoming and friendly.  Her rental house was everything we hoped for.  It's in a great location with quick and easy access to everything you'd need for a trip to visit Boston with friends.  It was comfortable, well decorated, clean, and classy."
5783197,75076492,2016-05-18,50318798,Andrew,"Lisa was great. She made us feel like we had relatives living in Boston. She met us when we arrived. She walked us through the apartment and gave us tips for dining and shopping in the neighborhood. The apartment itself was terrific, a real jewel. Large, spacious, comfortable updated with modern bath(s) and kitchen while still maintaining its vintage charm. Lisa pre-stocked the cupboards, refrigerator and dining table with small refreshments. We kept finding new little treats throughout our stay. The neighborhood is fantastic. Charming, peaceful and safe. Quintessential Boston. If you like to walk around and explore, this neighborhood is for you. This Air BnB is 5 star treat!"
5783197,76223316,2016-05-25,66795070,Sicong,The location is just perfect! The house is super cozy. Highly recommend!
5783197,77863443,2016-06-04,52708615,Paulina,"Lisa was great! Helped us with everything we needed! And we loved the place, great location!"
5783197,78391111,2016-06-06,24329817,Penny,"Everything about Lisa's apartment was wonderful! Absolutely immaculate, and being very picky about cleanliness so much appreciated similar high standards!! My family and I had a lovely time and would come back without thinking twice! The neighborhood is wonderful and quiet. Thank you Lisa for making our stay so perfect!"
5783197,82670577,2016-06-28,29748536,Patrick,"Très bon logement. Cuisine superbe. Salle de bain magnifique. Literie confortable, a l'exception du lit gonflable, peu confortable. Appartement tres bien situé, proche de Copley. Très calme et confortable. Lisa vous laissera quelques provisions, de quoi vous régaler.  Petit bémol: trouver une place de parking n'est pas facile, mais c'est pareil dans tout boston."
5783197,84956093,2016-07-09,64143750,Pauline,"Just returned from a fantastic stay at Lisa's amazing apartment in Boston.  The apartment is spacious, stylish and extremely well furnished - it really is as lovely as it appears in the photos.  Very well equipped and Lisa has included lots of little extra touches to make your visit special.  The much appreciated welcome basket was there on our arrival as well as useful everyday essentials. The apartment is centrally located offering some good local shops and restaurants and we also found it very easy to access all that beautiful Boston has to offer.  Lisa is everything you could want in a host - friendly, professional and accommodating.  I would have no hesitation in recommending that you stay here if you are lucky enough to be visiting Boston."
5783197,89258321,2016-07-27,57780963,Douglas,"Lisa was the perfect host, her place is an ideal way of living in South Boston and appreciating the area. The neighborhood is warm, friendly and very charming,"
5783197,90650093,2016-08-01,58022063,Rebecca,Lisa's House was well appointed and very clean and homely. She had left a welcome pack which was very much appreciated and although she was away when we arrived she provided us with an emergency contact and all the access information we needed. We did meet Lisa before we left and were able to chat about the neighbourhood. We had a very enjoyable stay.
5783197,91570687,2016-08-05,15899610,Rien,Great stay here. Very clean and beautiful apartment. Lots of space. Nice neighbourhood.
5783197,93729562,2016-08-13,3870057,Glen,"We absolutely loved our stay at Lisa's beautiful South End flat. She redid the entire home a few years ago, and the place is beautifully appointed, charming, clean and modern.  The other reviews do not quite do justice to this high-end listing.  It was perfect for our family, and it had a great layout with the bedrooms upstairs and the common space downstairs."
The red-brick South End is a vibrant neighborhood with unique restaurants,shops,pocket parks and architecture to explore. And it is within walking distance to public transportation and key Boston sites.  We loved going for walks all over the city right from our front door (and returning to the well-functioning air conditioning in the summer heat!).,,,
"Lisa was terrific throughout the process. She made herself available for any questions while we were there. We highly recommend this listing - we can't imagine that there are many better in Boston.\"",,,,,
14414473,94178245,2016-08-15,89219920,Joseph,"\"Awesome apartment. The decor was immaculate along with its cleanliness. Bill is a very informative and communicative host. The location was perfect given it's close proximity to the \"\"T\"\" and Fenway Park. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Boston area.\""
14414473,95379536,2016-08-19,23161551,Marie-Pier,"The apartment was perfect. It was very clean, comfortable and well located. Bill was also a great host. He made sure we were not missing of anything and he was very available. We would definitely recommand this place to anyone who would like to spend some quality time in Boston!"
14414473,97130790,2016-08-26,83822297,Kelly,"Bill and Kathy did a super job of getting me informed about what to do on my arrival and stayed in touch as needed throughout my stay. The space was beautiful and interesting, and they even had breakfast food and some beverages for me. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, but not in summer because there is no a/c and I am unfortunately a/c dependent."
14414473,98070431,2016-08-29,69032902,Nicole,"Bill & Kathy's place was great! They were very easy to reach and communicate with before, during, and after the trip. The location was great! Walking distance to the Roxbury Crossing T, allowing for easy access into the heart of the city. We walked from the apartment to Fenway and it was a nice walk leading us through Wentworth's campus and past the Museum of Fine Arts. The apartment itself was clean, comfortable, and well-appointed. The hosts left coffee, English muffins, orange juice for our mornings along with seltzer water. The bigger than a mini-fridge was perfect. It is a basement/garden unit--we arrived on a warm, muggy day and the fans in the bedroom and living areas were more than sufficient in keeping us cool. All in all, an awesome alternative to a hotel! Private, safe, and free & easy on-street parking makes this place a no-brainer. I would absolutely book this place again! Thank you Bill & Kathy!"
6895050,40534745,2015-07-31,9218268,Julius,"Gidget and Kyle were wonderful and friendly host. Kyle immediately greeted me upon entry and gave me a tour of the space and the roof deck. Although the space is shared, the host respected the upstairs space as if it were a private space. But they always made sure that I was taken cared off."
The space is as beautiful as pictured. The living room is very spacious and comfortable,as is the room. The roof deck was my favorite part of the listing,where I could hang out after a long day of work,gazing into the Boston Skyline.,,
Lastly,the location is prime! In Back Bay,"it's walking distance from everything you ever need.\"",,,
6895050,46652024,2015-09-12,43051201,Dan,"Everything was great! Gidget was a great host, and the unit was exactly as I had expected it to be - spacious and beautiful. The location was also great. I had a great time in Boston, in no small part to my awesome host."
6895050,47821984,2015-09-21,43221211,Angela,"This is an amazing place to stay and so convenient to the convention center where I had a conference.  Gidget and her husband were incredibly welcoming and accommodating. Their place is very spacious and bright, and the neighborhood is upscale and safe. If I'm ever in Boston again, I will definitely look them up!"
6895050,48208356,2015-09-24,85811,Craig,So glad I chose to stay with Kyle & Gidget! You should too.
The place - amazing! Better than advertised. Wish I could have enjoyed the flat for a full week.,,,,,
Location is tremendous for anyone attending an event at the Hynes Convention Center.,,,,,
Great jogging along the water and a short walk to Fenway.,,,,,
Kyle & Gidget made me feel right at home,showed me the neighborhood and even stepped out to meet me for a beverage one night. Excellent hosts. Lovely home.,,,,
"Book this gem right now!\"",,,,,
6895050,48925459,2015-09-29,43456526,Scott,"Gidget and Kyle were wonderful host. They showed us around a bit after we arrived at 11pm and then they were almost nonexistent for the rest of the trip, which was perfect. The location is beautiful and cosy, a great glass roof in the living room, normal roofs everywhere else. Thick heavy doors that feel like someone actually took care in the old building and crafted it. Up the top of a tiny stair case is an awesome sun-deck...or should I say moon-deck where we watched the recent super red lunar eclipse. Great walking location in Back Bay, right by the T and busses and sidewalks. There's a park like area right across the street, great for runs and walks and just a couple blocks down is the river that leads you out to the bay where you can sail and run and kayak and all that cool stuff. We walked or took public transit everywhere. Also it's walking distance to the Prudential building and Fenway Park Great. There's great shopping and dinning all around, bars and coffee shops just up the street. Very happy home in a very happy little neighborhood in a very happy city."
6895050,49363578,2015-10-03,44112816,Victor,"This is a sanctuary in Boston. I felt truly blessed to find this place. The owners are generous and kind. The space is sacred and relaxing. I can't day enough. I was away on a medical conference, and this space made all the difference. Thank you!"
6895050,49659312,2015-10-05,43593674,Karri,"This was my first experience on Airbnb and it exceeded my expectations. Gidget and Kyle were wonderful hosts, offering umbrellas and coats to us for the blustery days we were there. The space is beautiful and we had virtually everything we needed for a wonderful stay. I can't say enough about the location...extremely close to a host of restaurants, shopping and public transportation. If I am ever back in Boston, I will definitely ask to stay again."
6895050,49996206,2015-10-08,2095439,Mariya,"The space is absolutely beautiful. It's quite large and, even though there is not a separate entrance, feels very private. There is lots of space and the roofdeck is large and lovely. Location is perfect. Gidget and her husband were great hosts. She was very responsive and accommodating. I was in town on business, and this was a much better deal/situation than the hotels nearby. Highly recommended!"
P.S. There are stairs involved,"in case you have tons of bulky luggage or physical difficulties.\"",,,,
6895050,50569780,2015-10-12,957760,Chris,"Although I unfortunately didn't get to actually meet Gidget -- she was out of town on the day I was there -- my experience staying at her place was excellent.  Everything was coordinated well, making it easy to pick up keys and make myself at home in the upstairs portion of their home.  I spent a pleasant afternoon on the roof deck working on my laptop.  The place is in a great location and has everything one could want out of an air bnb."
6895050,51322458,2015-10-19,12572711,Carina,"We had a fantastic stay at Gidget and Kyle's home. It was just as described and photographed (bigger, actually), clean and with all necessary amenities. They were very communicative and available during our stay, but we really had the place to ourselves. The neighborhood was PERFECT. We walked to dinner on Newbury Street and also to Cambridge - plenty of coffee, shopping, etc. on a gorgeous street. Great space and hosts - I would absolutely stay again!"
6895050,52130341,2015-10-26,24631727,Eliza,"Gidget was a wonderful host! She helped me with parking, offered to bring my keys to me when I locked myself out, and was always very friendly."
Her place was just as beautiful as the pictures,and the roof-deck was even better. Gorgeous views of the city and great architecture from each window. Plus,one of the most comfortable beds and pillows I've had the privilege of sleeping on! Super clean.,,,
Easy walk to my conference in Copley Square - always felt safe,even at 11:30pm. Minutes to good shopping and food (I liked The Wired Puppy for coffee).,,,,
"I was initially concerned that this wasn't a fully \"\"private' space",but I felt very safe and private on my level.,,,,
"I would *definitely* stay here again! \"",,,,,
6895050,52510035,2015-10-30,45620744,Susanne,It's a really nice and clean place with a big open living room and kitchen. The location is perfect and close to everything!
6895050,59680326,2016-01-13,10720060,Jon,Gidget was a great host and the place was fantastic.
6895050,65065580,2016-03-10,20825376,Joseph,"I give the experience a 15 out of 15  (5 each for apartment, people, and location) with 100% probability that this is my first choice in Boston. OK, if these words are appearing on your screen it is a rare instance when the AirBnb algorithm is showing this unit to anyone, because it is always booked. STOP READING. You can always come back to this review after you sign up. I write alot and someone is going to book ahead of you while you read, and it could have been yours.....Ok, all signed up? First of all, the pictures are not accurate -- the apartment is even better in real life. I wish I'd had more time to just hang out. The light, layout, mattress, deck, kitchen (can you tell those counters are granite?) made me feel like I was in a Friends episode -- but without the annoying roommates (and in Boston obviously). Kyle and Gidget were very friendly and welcoming, gave me a 15 minute orientation, and then kind of vanished. It is a little expensive relative to what I usually spend, but super worth it. Location: I mean, you've probably heard of Back Bay, Newbury Street, Commonwealth Avenue?  That's where it is, and Gidget pointed out some of the better breakfast places, though I always prefer to make breakfast, and did. If you take the train, you want Back Bay station, not South Street. (I found out about the stations late and Amtrak charged me $20 for a shorter ride. They're probably charging me $100 today for not taking a train at all.) There are three things that may matter more to you than they did for me, and if they are enough to ruin the experience for you than we are very different people, but hey, you should know. First, and Gidget will tell you this before she accepts you, there are stairs. A beautiful two or three flights up this grand staircase from the high-ceilinged lobby -- not Tara grand, but Beacon Hill grand --  to the entrance and the level where Kyle and Gidget live, then a narrow corkscrew metal staircase up to your apartment, like the ones backstage in a theatre. And then another metal corkscrew up to the deck. I'm fine with it. Second, it is a fact that there is no actual door to your apartment, just a corkscrew staircase. So if you are concerned about your hosts climbing the stairs and walking in on you, you might be uncomfortable. I didn't care, and there is nothing scary about Kyle and Gidget, but it may matter to you (and increases my chance of getting another booking!). Finally, Wifi was good day one, less good day two. May have been my computer, not their wifi, but I had to use personal hotspot, which can get costly. By now someone else has the reservation, so I hope you get it next time you visit Boston."
6895050,68423504,2016-04-04,12300715,Shelley,"The pictures do not do this lovely apartment justice!  It is homey and elegant at the same time with an incredible kitchen and very comfortable living area.  The skylights and many windows made the condo feel bright even during some grayish days.  The weather was too cold and wet to be able to enjoy the lovely deck, but perhaps next time!  The bed was very comfortable with nice linens.  Gidget and Kyle were perfect hosts, welcoming me warmly into their home and yet giving me total privacy. The location was fantastic for walking, shopping, eating, and people watching.  There are 3 markets within a short walk, allowing for easy and affordable meals in the condo.  There are also wonderful restaurants every where."
The only cons about the condo would be for individuals unable to easily climb the 4 flights of stairs to the condo.  There is no elevator. The bathroom was well stocked and clean,but like many bathrooms in elegant old buildings,was not large.,,,
Overall,"the condo and the stay far exceeded my expectations!\"",,,,
6895050,69682941,2016-04-12,65863411,Tina,"First of all the place is incredibly beautiful, you get what you see in the pictures as it is. And the location is great, one block away from the Hynes Convention Centre where we need to go for a conference meeting. Kyle and Didget are nice landlords, they prepared coffee power, juice, milk, bacon, bread and other food stuff for us so we can make breakfast. I didn't have a chance to see Didget but Kyle welcomed us and treated us really well by offering us the information we needed and made us feel at home. When we left the condo and arrived at the airport for a flight to NYU we found out our backpack was left on the table with my bf's passport in there, we called Kyle and he was so nice that he drove to airport to bring us the backpack. We appreciate it so much! He saved our life! I highly recommend this place~"
6895050,72167094,2016-05-01,51327576,Sarah,"A real gem in the hear to back bay! We had a wonderful stay while we were in town for a wedding. Gidget warmly welcomed us when we arrived, gave us fresh towels, showed us how to use the windows, wifi, TV etc and then gave us our privacy for the rest of our stay. The apartment is as beautiful as is in the pictures with lots of natural sunlight. While the listing says private room, you really feel like you have your own apartment. You have your own bedroom, a small bathroom, and do not even have to share the kitchen, the owners have their own quarters down the spiral stairs. It was clean, and the kitchen has everything you need to make a meal. At night you can hear a little traffic so just bring a fan for white noise if you are a light sleeper, but you are going to find that anywhere you stay in the city. It was nice weather while we were there so we did enjoy our breakfast on the roof deck one morning which was a real treat. We would highly recommend!"
6895050,80462061,2016-06-18,76946964,Lindsay,"Wonderful experience! The place was incredible, and the rooftop patio looked out over the beautiful city. Gidget was incredibly welcoming and accommodating. The condo made out stay in Boston truly memorable!"
6895050,80902467,2016-06-20,58226168,Lyndsey,"I had a fabulous stay! Gidget was extremely helpful and even made the effort to share information with me about a talk at Harvard that she thought I might be interested in. The only minor issue for me was that there was no door between the Airbnb flat and the owner's flat. They gave me complete privacy, but it was a surprise to me that there was no private lockable door to the flat. If I ever return to Boston, I will stay here again. Thanks Gidget!!"
6895050,91442729,2016-08-05,55460914,Robert,"Wow, I really can't say enough about Gidget and Kyle and their home. I'll start with the home: it is unreal... across the street from a replica castle with a roof top view of sunset and a huge sky roof that i'd sit on their cozy L couch watching the rain drop from the sky or the moon and stars. awesome awesome pad and it is literally in the heart of Boston. The Marathon passes right on their street and there is a green way that goes all the way to the Boston Commons and the Charles River is 3 blocks (URL HIDDEN) is rediculous and I feel like my Boston experience was ELEVATED by staying here."
Now for Gidget and Kyle - they are some of the best human beings I've ever met and I consider them friends and family. I stayed here Monday-Thursday for a month  while working and every night it was like going home. EXAMPLE: they cooked me DELICIOUS swordfish one night and we stayed up chatting and kyle serenaded us on guitar. Gidget is a very inspired and deeply caring woman who is highly involved in the community and connected me to so so many beautiful people while I was here. Kyle is an adventurer at heart and is a sailor and was fun to spend time with drinking wine on the rooftop. lets see what else,"I imagine that any time I visit Boston I will visit them.\"",,,,
6895050,92889484,2016-08-10,55460914,Robert,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
28150,682865,2011-11-01,1299010,Alison,"We had a wonderful experience on Beacon in Back Bay. The neighborhood was great and safe, with nice brownstones and plenty of shopping and grocery stores and resources nearby. We were able to walk to many tour spots. Accessing the location was also very convenient, and they answered any questions I had before the visit. The apartment was just what we needed for a four-person stay -- a bedroom, with a pull-out couch in a living room, and a fully equipped kitchen and bathroom. A nice place to relax at the end of the day. Safe, easy and convenient."
28150,1094347,2012-04-07,1976738,Mathias,Perfect apartment from the location point of view. Hardly to top. Very close to the city & also for joggers a perfect place. You can jogge along the river.
"It let you feel the way it should for Boston. Really old tradition house with a lot of charme. Negative point was the little moldy kitchen & the TV didn't work as a cable was missing - but not a big deal. Overall I would really recommend the place. We were 4 people btw - space was enough.\"",,,,,
28150,1373319,2012-05-29,2200358,Rachel,"We were in Boston checking out colleges and the Beacon Hill apartment we rented was exactly as pictured.  When the air conditioner didn't work (on a very hot day), I was pretty concerned since there were 3 of us in a 1-bedroom. But Kitty's staff sent over a maintenance person right away and problem was fixed within minutes.  Great neighborhood, great apartment, great service!"
28150,1441587,2012-06-09,1918544,Edward,Worked out well. There was one late-night fire alarm but was resolved. Good to know that the fire department responds so quickly!
28150,2088252,2012-08-25,2277464,Howard,"Great location, walking distance to most sites, nice kitchen and even a washing machine and dryer to use.  The sofa bed was terrible, you can feel the springs.  So If you are looking for an apartment in a great location with a nice kitchen and do not need the sofa bed this is the place for you."
28150,2259955,2012-09-11,2245699,Pablo Luis,"We stayed three days in Boston and we found the apartment very safe, clean and comfortable. The very nice neighborhood and close to all points of interest, it is absolutely advisable to be in the apartment of Beacon St.Babylon 9"

28150,2474044,2012-10-01,26541,Mario,"Très bien situé près de tous les services et à moins de 20 minutes de marche de tout (Musée des Sciences, Quincy Market, Aquarium). À deux pas des parcs (Boston Common), du métro et de la Newburystreet (parfait pour le magasinage). Appartement correct et complet qui demande un peu de rafraichissement (peinture, portes qui coincent...petits détails qui n'enlèvent à rien au reste) et nous permettant (4R) d'être confortable pour deux couples (mezzanine idéal pour les enfants avec échelle pour l'atteindre). Bref, un bel appart très très bien situé pour ceux qui veulent découvrir Boston à pied"
28150,17595747,2014-08-14,17133432,Max,"\"Below are the Pros and Cons for the items that \"\"we\"\" found important."
Pros:,,,,,
- The apartment has a wonderful location.,,,,,
- Fully furnished with all required items in the kitchen and plenty of towels and linens to last for several days.,,,,,
- Cable TV with many channels. Didn't use it too much,but was nice to sit down at the end of the day and relax with options on TV.,,,,
- Elevator in the building helped to get our luggage in and out.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
- We have stayed here in August. The living room has Air Conditioning that worked well to keep the Living Room cool. In the bedroom there is no AC and the ceiling fan is located so high that we could not really feel any airflow even at full speed. Opening the windows helped a little,"but it was still somewhat uncomfortable. \"",,,,
28150,17974326,2014-08-19,19637013,Katherine,"Great location! Apartment was good size, nicely furnished. Some minor defects (sliding door that did not function properly, broken cabinet door), and perhaps could have been a little bit cleaner, but overall was nice. This apartment definitely served our needs very well as we had our 18 month old with us so it was nice to have a full kitchen, bath and separate bedroom. Unfortunately he got sick and we had to leave a day early! But this apartment was a good fit during our stay."
28150,22587209,2014-11-10,8614662,Catherine,"Nice apartment in a really nice area of Boston. Cheers bar and Boston Common just opposite. Check in was very smooth, information was provided in a timely fashion and the entry codes worked fine. Lift not immediately obvious and pretty old but a God send if you are on the upper floors with luggage."
"\"",,,,,
28150,22991942,2014-11-19,17669007,John-Paul,For a solo traveller or couple the size of the offering was adequate. Location is great as its close to Charles St and not too far a walk to Newbury and Boyston.
I did not see an elevator for this property. Not an issue for me,"but something to consider as this unit is on the fifth floor. Best to confirm with the landlord if one is there if you need it. Certainly worth the price paid.  It was generally clean. Clean fresh linens and towels were provided. Could've used a bit more attention to vacuuming. All in all good value. Thank you. \"",,,,
28150,37461375,2015-07-07,32160784,Michael,"Kitty was very helpful with my reservation.  There was no check-in, just an email with the lobby door and room code (very convenient).  The apartment was clean, comfortable and close to the Freedom Trail, Newbury Street (shopping and restaurants).  Thankfully one of the guests provide elevator instructions, otherwise 6 flights of stairs to climb."
28150,37657777,2015-07-09,32063155,Kate,"Our stay in Boston Back Bay was lovely. The area is beautiful and also central. The apartment was spacious, modern, clean and highly equipped. Would highly recommend."
28150,40251428,2015-07-29,3487545,Rob,A comfortable apartment in a beautiful Brownstone building in the Back Bay Area. The host was quick to respond to queries and were able to offer this apartment as an alternative when our first choice was already booked. I would definitely stay here again as it was such a good location to explore Boston.
28150,40575211,2015-08-01,30760072,Kate,We arrived just before the check in time at 2.50pm. The apartment had not been cleaned from the previous occupants. At 3.30pm the cleaner finally arrived and they cleaned while we sat in the living area. The property manager came and realised what had happened and was extremely apologetic for the inconvenience.
The apartment itself is situated in the perfect location right next to boston common. Air conditioning in both the living room and the bedroom which was great considering how hot and humid it was while we were in Boston. The wifi signal was weak and we had to keep logging in which was a little annoying,but glad we had it available. The building itself is old and you can hear all the footsteps above you and in the hall very loudly. Bed was ok. Very bouncy mattress. Shower takes a LONG time to heat up. The sliding door into the bedroom does not close,it has come off it's rails or something and gets stuck.,,,
Overall,"nice accommodation in a great spot with a few minor details which detracted from the overall experience. \"",,,,
28150,43226473,2015-08-18,33403106,Elizabeth,We Stayed on Beacon St in Boston .
The rooms were nice .,,,,,
Loved that we felt like we had our own apartment .,,,,,
The Area is very nice .,,,,,
The Park is just up the street on the corner .,,,,,
Lovely clean neighborhood . Our Daughter lives in Back Bay so this was a perfect location . Charles street with wonderful restaurants and shops not far away.,,,,,
We certainly felt safe walking in the area .,,,,,
The river is across the street .,,,,,
The Washer and Dryer were nice to have since one of us runs and it's nice to be able to deal with the workout clothes .,,,,,
The Elevator is very hard to find .,,,,,
It is on the first floor at the end of the Hall on the right . Just a small door that looks like a fire door. We wouldn't have found it if we hadn't read others reviews and knew to look for it .,,,,,
Cleanliness was acceptable but not perfect,"",,,,
We were a bit disappointed to find our room still being cleaned at 3:15 and we had to wait another twenty minutes .,,,,,
The Kitchen is nicely stocked with everything anyone would need to cook and serve a meal .,,,,,
The bed was not the most comfortable but acceptable .,,,,,
Wifi was easy to access but a bit iffy at times .,,,,,
All and all a very nice place to stay and we will/would stay here again .,,,,,
Loved having our own apartment and the freedom to come and go as we wanted .,,,,,
The Keypad entrance is great no keys to remember .,,,,,
Again we loved our stay and would stay here again happily .,,,,,
Big Thank you to our hosts,,,,,
Who you never have to see,"which we also liked . \"",,,,
28150,46538445,2015-09-11,41880848,Robert,"Lovely brownstone building, with primary advantage being the location. Building has been sectioned into a bunch of units on 6 floors. Plenty of space in the unit, nice decoration, and a full kitchen. Great option if you need to be in walking distance from downtown Boston or Copley place."
28150,49019212,2015-09-30,42118654,Lianne,The information provided before check out is sufficient except the elevator.  As we have been put on the 6th Floor the top floor of the building if we were clear there is an elevator we would not have to walk up with our 3 big suitcases and felt so exhausted and of course frustrated.  We found it on the next day there is actually one but there is no sign of an elevator except very tiny words next to the wall.  I remember i did request for an apt on the lower floor but still being put on the top floor.
The air conditioners are another trouble.  They were so noisy that you just have to turn them off.   I hope the management staff could fix it immediately for the next guest.,,,,,
Early in the morning before 7 am there were some workers already working downstairs and they were so noisy.  Fortunate we had an early agenda.,,,,,
"Everything else was good.  The apartment looks like the picture except its smaller and not as bright.\"",,,,,
28150,50885259,2015-10-15,45615218,Pascal,"Great location, a minute from Boston Common."

There was a minor mix up with my reservation dates and with a quick call Andrew took care of it within minutes.  You seriously cannot beat this location for this price.  Right on Beacon Street and within walking distance to everything."
28150,81752414,2016-06-24,67382072,Adam,"One block from the Boston Public Gardens, a block from the Charles River, and really close to the T which will take you just about anywhere.  We couldn't have asked for anything more.  The apartment was well maintained, nicely updated with all the comforts of home.  Being right in the city our intention was to be out and about for most of our time but when the travels began to wear us out it was easy to find comfort and relax in the Beacon Street apartment.  I can easily recommended the apartment to anyone but would prefer to keep this gem to myself.  For our next stay in Boston this apartment will be our first choice."
13711334,85929564,2016-07-14,48977730,Doug,Spacious well equipped apartment in good area that was sub floor so a little dark.

The house is really clean and quiet and the room is sunny in the morning which is nice. 10 mins drive to the subway. It's everything I could ask for.  Definitely worth more than its being sold. And those kitties are just so lovely. I really had a good stay.
10964552,67884717,2016-04-01,57761838,Casey,Erin is the best host ever! My husband and I stayed with her for about 3 weeks and it was perfect! The house is so great and her kitchen is fantastic! I was working at the Longwood campus and the commute was very easy and not stressful at all. The bus station is right by her house! She has two sweet kitties that were a joy to be around!She went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and taken care of! I will recommend her to anyone!
10964552,68770790,2016-04-06,62552721,Jessica,I stayed at Erin's home for 2 nights. Erin was a friendly host. Her home is very clean and well kept. The neighborhood is quiet and safe.

It was a privilege to get to play with both of her adorable kittens, Dora and Thumbalina. I enjoyed being able to relax in the living room and talk to Erin as well. This was my first time using airbnb, but I had a fantastic stay and highly recommend staying with Erin."
10964552,71703115,2016-04-27,66636789,Lisa,"Erin is a hospitable, generous host. My friend and I stayed for one night, arriving late in the day (around 10PM) and leaving early the next morning. Erin greeted us warmly and was even kind to offer a few toiletries if we were without. The room was comfortable and clean. The next morning, we were able to use the kitchen to make a quick meal for breakfast. The surrounding neighborhood is fairly quiet and residential. Taking public transportation to get to Erin's from downtown Boston is extremely easy and seamless."

And cats were adorable! Thank you Erin!"

She is really close to a lot of cool sights. Her home was nice, everything was top quality. The pillows were very comfortable. Even though she gave us a box fan, the room got a little stuffy in the middle of the night. The great thing about Erin is I am sure if I had told her before I went to bed she would have done everything she could to fix it. Great value!"

We didn't get to see Erin too much because of our busy schedule, but all out interactions were great and Erin was so nice and excited to hear our plans and give us some ideas of what to do! We used the Forest Hills station which was super easy with $6 all day parking and $5.50 round trip T tickets. Some may think the station is a little sketchy, but we got home one of the days after midnight and had no issues. We had an AWESOME time in Boston. Thanks Erin."

We dropped our belongings off and left and when we got back later that night our room was prepared for us. We did not get a chance to meet with Erin but she did let us use the washer and dryer.

The two best features of the place are the location,very close to Centre St (restaurants,bars,bus). And the very good breakfast (actually,the loft is part of a BnB so you get to have breakfast with the other BnB guests).,
Practically,all went smoothly,"Andrei had good communication and there is also someone on site whom you can call in case of problem.\"",,,

Not very far from the subway that the locals call the T."

The key hand-offs couldn't have been any easier on either end of the stay. The loft itself was perfect for my brother and his wife who were visiting me from out of town, ideally located in such an awesome neighborhood. It was clean, quiet, super private, and nicely furnished. And the breakfasts were, according to my brother, the best he's ever had. Definitely a first rate Airbnb!"

The train station is about a 10 min walk away with another 15-20 mins into the heart of Boston. Breakfast provided in the morning is perfect. This place is associated with a bed and breakfast so they know how to accommodate guests perfectly.\""
8981656,98905822,2016-09-02,19929737,Linda,I had a great stay. I never met Andrei but he was easily reachable. The breakfast was excellent and the people very open and friendly. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures--no surprises. I would definitely stay here again.
9825415,57246964,2015-12-23,46151270,Lin,Great place. Antoinne was very nice and offered to pick me up at the station upon arrival. He also gave great recommendations for restaurants and sightseeing locations. The place is clean with a quiet neighborhood. Highly recommended.

9825415,65875233,2016-03-17,62042253,Karina,"Antoinne was so sweet when caring for me, always messaging me to see if everything was going alright. He was welcoming, and friendly from start to end. The location is great bc its right near boston common, such a great location. Roommate was sweet as well, and was very homey for a short stay."
9825415,66492628,2016-03-22,59833963,Matthew,"The room was good and accurate to the renters description. However, his roommate would leave his hairs on the toilet seat for me to clean up if I needed to use it. I was given 2 towels for a three night stay. So if you take more than one shower a day plan on using wet towels. Other than that the room was what it was described as. However I would not stay there again if I was too visit Boston."
9825415,69009668,2016-04-08,64088711,John,"The host was very out going, and made me feel right at home.  The neighborhood was very convenient and close to Tufts Medical Center and the T.  Not much more to be said, hes a nice guy and the apartment is a great place to crash at while in the heart of Boston"
9825415,72212536,2016-05-01,25537463,Gregg,"Antoinne was a great host. Both he and later his roommate gave me the local foodie insights of places to eat and drink in Boston so that was very welcome. His place is conveniently located located to transportation and key sites so staying there was very practical for me. All in all, a great stay."
9825415,73527688,2016-05-08,16831816,Hayley,"Antoinne was the perfect host! Despite our late check-in time, he was able to coordinate meeting us and handing off the keys. He also provided very helpful information about the neighborhood and local gems. The apartment itself is in the PERFECT location for exploring the city, just a short walk from Boston Commons and the T. It's a beautiful area, full of tree-lined streets and old buildings. Overall a very pleasant stay, and would definitely return in the future!"
9825415,75015111,2016-05-18,16743282,Riadh,"We really appreciate that Antoine was so flexible with the check in. We didnt meet him but his roomate was there to welcome us. The location is just perfect, the neighborhood is charming, calm and close to everything. The only issue was that our room wasnt that clean same for the bathroom :s  Anyway we enjoyed Antoine's appartement."
9825415,95497731,2016-08-20,86612499,Tatsuro,"Great hospitality; Antoinne arranged the room cleanly. Also, he took me from the airport to the apartment by his car."

9825415,97765249,2016-08-28,74033586,Fernando,"Antoinne is easily one of the best hosts I have stayed with. It's like staying at your best friend's house! First of all, Antoinne took time out of his busy schedule to come pick us up at one of the main stations so that we wouldn't have to worry about directions. Then, he spent time with us understanding what we wanted to get out of Boston and gave us valuable suggestions. Antoinne even followed up half way through out stay to make sure we didn't need anything. Regarding the place, we found it very clean and pleasant. The AC in the room was a life savior, as it was very hot in the city. Finally, the location of the apartment is excellent and close to everything we wanted to do All in, a great stay and wouldn't hesitate to come back for my next stay."
5371051,54673421,2015-11-22,25774120,Hobiedy,Bernard was a tremendous host. Very polite and very helpful with anything I needed. The apartment was really nice and a great size especially considering the price tag. I would gladly book with Bernard again.
5371051,57769926,2015-12-29,22443241,Joe,The host canceled this reservation 114 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5371051,58439615,2016-01-02,19973402,Tarcisio,Great place! Very clean and close of all services. Bernard is great host. That's my new spot for all my trip in boston!
5371051,59881868,2016-01-16,29411592,Derrick,I had a great stay at Bernard's apartment. It was clean and reminded of an apartment on a black sitcom. I had a couple people over and I almost wanted to say it was my new apartment with all the compliments I got. The location is also very good. It's on a relatively quiet street but is close to a lot of things and public transportation. Bernard was also pretty good with getting back to me so I never felt worried about booking or getting the keys. Besides an arduous walk upstairs (that I enjoyed actually) I can't really say anything bad about Bernard or his apartment. I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone looking in the area.
5371051,66556956,2016-03-23,61540120,Michaela,We had a wonderful stay at Bernard's place. The apartment was very clean and we felt safe with the home situated up on a hill. Parking was very easy. I would recommend this place to visitors from around the Boston area who know their way around as well as those from our of town.
5371051,68503673,2016-04-05,20239949,Myriam,"Bernard a été très accueillant et compréhensif. Je voyageais avec mon mari et mon bébé. J'ai dû quitter au bout d'une nuit puisqu'avec tout le bruit (alarme de pompier, police, etc.) mon bébé était incapable de dormir. 3 des mes amies sont venues prendre ma place afin de ne pas perdre ma réservation et Bernard a été très compréhensif. L'appartement est tel qu'indique."
5371051,70120625,2016-04-16,65113337,Peter,Helpful in getting bags in and settled.
5371051,70706831,2016-04-19,55292329,Dylan,Bernard was a fantastic host to us while we were in town for the marathon.  His place was very clean & he provided great recommendations for area restaurants.  Would likely recommend a stay at Bernard's if you're passing through South Boston.
5371051,73226525,2016-05-07,28072772,Sam,Bernard was fantastic and the place was lovely and comfortable. Parking was easy and it was great for our business trip.
5371051,73959934,2016-05-11,61468198,Zilla,Bernard was an amazing host. He was polite and super helpful when we had any questions. The house was clean & comfortable. The location was convenient.
5371051,76845933,2016-05-29,65978076,David,"A beautiful home, with a host that goes above and beyond for his guest. My family was pleased and very appreciative. Absolutely recommend this place."
5371051,78424465,2016-06-06,61291184,Kurt,Bernard was an excellent host and the check in process was easy. The house was as advertised and was well equipped for our family of 6.  The location in Dorchester was a bit out of the way but easily accessible by Uber with little to no wait.   I would recommend Bernard's place to a friend.
5371051,80169628,2016-06-16,5643306,Sandy,Thank you for your hospitality. We found your home clean and comfortable. The only issue we had during our stay was the noise level from the parties living below us that went late into the night. Turning on the portable fan the last couple of nights helped. Thanks again.
5371051,81002410,2016-06-20,11743333,Oscar,"Bernard's house is excellent! All rooms were very clean and all beds were very comfortable. Bathroom was in perfect shape. We didn't get to use the kitchen but it was great. Air conditioning, fans, TVs, etc were all fabulous."
5371051,82222395,2016-06-26,36307420,Jiening,Great place to stay!
5371051,82867555,2016-06-30,7769935,Gene,"Bernard's Dorchester apt. was a wonderful escape from a couple of tough business days in Boston. It is exactly as pictured, clean, spacious and private. Bernard was an attentive host, checking in at all the right times, never pushy or rude."
An additional bonus was the value Bernard's place offers. It appears that central Boston Air BnBs are pretty expensive. I cut my cost in half by staying 10 minutes outside of central Boston and actually prefer Dorchester's cultural mix - think Bed-Stuy,Brooklyn.,,,,
I had a car and am familiar with Boston,so it was a quick 10 minute drive from Dorchester to the Boston Convention Center,and thus a 10-15 minute drive to Back Bay,the South End,etc. But there's a commuter rail stop close by that would take you to South Station and from there you'd pick up the subway to any major destination,like Logan Airport.
The only downside - to be fair - is the steps you need to go up to get into Bernard's house. This may not be a good fit for a traveler with a disability.,,,,,
That aside,Bernard's Dorchester Air BnB is a nice,clean,"affordable place to crash when visiting Boston.\"",,
5371051,83140073,2016-07-01,57690863,Eric,"The house is really beautiful! Nice furnitures, good equipments also with a lovely balcony where you can enjoy your beers with some breeze. Me and my family had a good stay there, it's the best offer I've ever seen in Airbnb: 3 bedrooms & kitchen & living room & balcony with this price! It's impossible to find a more proper house for family trip like this."
5371051,83396418,2016-07-02,73964467,Haixiang,We really feel comfortable living in Bernard's home. Very clean and convenient location that near supermarket and some stores. We will be back again!
5371051,83775465,2016-07-04,73346170,Élise,"L'appartement de Bernard a été l'endroit parfait pour se reposer mes amis et moi, après une longue journée de visite de Boston! Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de nous rencontrer mais toutes les indications ont rendu notre arrivée très facile. Les lits étaient confortables, l'appartement très propre, chaleureux, très bien équipé et très tranquille malgré les festivités du 4 juillet! Merci de nous avoir accueillis :)"
5371051,87916867,2016-07-22,79911238,Lili,"Our stay in Boston at this particular place was great! The place exceeded our expectations- it was very spacious & clean, nicely decorated and well organized. All of the rooms were very clean & we appreciated that each room had a tv with a variety of channels to watch. This was a great way to relax after a full day of walking & sightseeing. Our room in particular had a very comfortable bed, a convenient dresser, a full-length mirror, a good-sized closet, spacious desk space, a comfortable office chair & air conditioning. We also appreciated that the bathroom & kitchen had several amenities available to us- dish soap, air freshener, sponges, bath soap, towels, dishes & a modern microwave & refrigerator. The fridge even had cold water for us to drink :) Everything was easy & convenient to use in the house. We also appreciated having air conditioning in the house. Additionally, our host Bernard was very good about communicating with us prior to and during our stay in Boston. He ensured that we were able to access the house, that our stay was comfortable & to let him know if we had questions about anything. We highly recommend this AirBnb to travelers & visitors alike! We would stay here again if we have the opportunity :)"

5371051,98128552,2016-08-29,8673374,Judith,Bernard was a great host. He came by to see everything was fine and was very quick at responding to any messages. tHe flat worked out great for 5 of us. It was perfect. Neighbourhood could be noisy - there was a very loud party one night that went on late.

13525610,80569081,2016-06-19,17471380,Jason,"Hociang's accommodation was an terrific find. Super clean and comfortable bedroom, quiet end of the street location, with secure peaceful privacy. I arrive quite late, which made the clear entry instructions, as well as the fresh bottle of water and late-night snack extra special. The nearby Mission Restaurant was a notable favorite. I look forward to saying here again in the future."
13525610,81470473,2016-06-23,78878798,Andrew,Enjoyable atmosphere. Friendly host and very clean setting.

This location is very close and convenient to Longwood Medical area (just a quick walk down the road).  The location is also convenient as there are stores, restaurants, the T and bus lines close by."

13525610,94374923,2016-08-15,82427360,Chun Yu,"Hochiang is a very friendly and approachable host who maintains good communication with his guests. He usually responds to Airbnb messages within a short period of time. His place is as clean and tidy as the pictures show. You can go to almost every tourist attraction and landmark by taking the T, and even on foot.But there might be a problem to some guests: if you take the room that is to the left of the mirror, you might not get any wifi access occasionally(Sometimes there is wifi signal, but it is quite weak). So it might be better to bring a wifi egg or something similar with you(or just to use your mobile data). Nevertheless, it is a nice experience to stay there."
13525610,95649466,2016-08-20,2122693,Vaughan,A great place to stay.  Exactly as described. Quiet and very conveniently located.  The local amenities were excellent (e.g. the Post Office directly across the road is handy for sending postcards and parcels home).  The bed was very comfortable and public transport couldn't be easier.  The flat is equipped with all the essentials and a well stocked coffee machine.
Getting in/out was easy and Hochiang was incredibly responsive and helpful in his emails/text messages.,,,,,
"Highly recommended. \"",,,,,

5588537,31553723,2015-05-06,1270380,Salvatore,We had an amazing time at Marc's place. The location is perfectly situated in the heart of the south end and a quick walk to everything Boston has to offer. The apartment has a great layout with a roof deck and a balcony. Super clean and there was a bottle of wine waiting for us on arrival. We were met by Marc's Dad with the keys. He rules and was such a gentleman. There's even a picture of him doing a keg stand in the apartment. We would stay here again anytime.
5588537,34417068,2015-06-08,30208954,Anne,We had a great time in Boston staying at Marc's apartment! We were arriving late in the evening so we were overnighted our keys ahead of time which was great! It really was home away from home! Marc and Steph made us feel so welcome and were in regular contact to make sure all went smoothly for us upon arrival. It was such a great experience from start to finish! The location and apartment exceeded our expectations! We can't wait to return and hope we can stay in their lovely home again.
5588537,35076859,2015-06-15,1727847,Stephanie,Wonderful apartment with an amazing roof deck!  What a view!  And so very nice to be able to take a glass of the wine Marc and Stephanie left up to the roof and just enjoy the evening!  Absolutely no problems at all with this great place.  Marc was a joy to deal with and easy communications are just another plus!
5588537,50342680,2015-10-11,18641929,Danielle,"Marc and Stephanie were great hosts. We did not meet them personally but they were very responsive via text and even called to help my husband navigate their TV system. We were welcomed with thoughtful details that made us feel right at home and their space is truly amazing. Neither my husband or I, wanted to leave at the end of our stay."
The location is absolutely fabulous. Marc suggested some amazing local restaurants and we spent a good portion of our trip exploring the South End,truly an amazing neighborhood,my new favorite in Boston! The apartment is just a five minute walk from the Orange Line and there are a few markets within walking distance.,,,
"I literally cannot say enough good things about our stay. The house was clean and even more than we could have hoped for. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family and hope that we can stay there again soon!\"",,,,,
5588537,88499873,2016-07-24,52684729,Brandon,"We had an incredible time in Boston and Marc and Steph's place was the perfect spot for our trip. The location is fantastic, especially for anyone who has not gotten a chance to spend much time in the Back Bay area. Very cool feel to it with all the red brick and cobblestone sidewalks. Lot's of good little bars and coffee shops, and if you are staying for the weekend, you have to try Masa's brunch. Really easy to get downtown or over to Fenway Park from there as well."
As far as the place itself,we loved the layout and feel of their condo. It's both cozy and modern,with exposed brick walls and spiral staircases. Marc and Steph were great hosts and made everything incredibly easy and welcoming. You can tell pretty quickly they are happily living life together and we wish them nothing but the best.,,,
We also LOVED the roof deck,and it really made for a unique experience,"with the string lights and view of the Hancock tower. We actually spent one night up there drinking wine and listening to music after a long day of running around the city. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. \"",,,

Best of all was the location! About 15 minute walk to newbury street and even closer to the T. Can't imagine having a better place to stay."

Lev's apartment was beautiful and I had such a great stay. I needed a place at the last minute and he was able to accommodate me with no trouble at all. His communication was great,and the apartment was just as described. The apartment was equipped with everything I could've needed from a washer &dryer,"to basic toiletries and extra towels. Location was great and also very accessible by the T. I even lucked up and found street parking in front of the house every night! I would definitely stay here again .\"",,,
5743939,30509409,2015-04-23,27597819,David,"Lev was a great host.  We had several questions and he dealt with them immediately and beyond our expectations.  We felt like a Bostonian the entire week.  To be right in the heart of Beacon hill with a flower shop, Italian restaurant and a pizza place below our apartment was great.  I would definitely love to stay her again.  Thank you Lev!"
5743939,30845523,2015-04-27,15712525,Nikolas,Booked last minute due to a cancellation. The host was very accommodating and the space in an ideal location. The floor layout suited our family perfectly with 2 bedrooms and plenty of space. A great place to stay and enjoy Boston
5743939,32245952,2015-05-16,29815576,Julia,"We enjoyed our visit to Boston and especially Lev's apartment. His apartment is extremly clean and you won't miss thing. The location next to the famous Charles Street, MGH and the Redline is just perfect. Plus Lev is very reliable and answers your questions super fast. So don't hesitate to book his apartment, if you ever go to Boston."
5743939,32751948,2015-05-21,11024963,Shane,"Levs place was spacious, clean, and in a great location. Lev was super communicative and was always willing to help. I'd recommend him to anyone in the future!"
5743939,33503536,2015-05-29,29637915,Adaya,"Lev was communicative about how to access his apartment, left fresh towels and linens for us to use, and invited us to eat the food he had (cereal, milk, etc). He also knew we would have five guests and blew up the Aerobed for us before we arrived. On our last day in Boston, he also gave us a little more time in the apartment to accommodate for a later train, which was very much appreciated. The apartment is in a great location and easily accessible to all parts of Boston, which was nice. The washer/dryer also came in handy."
Be advised that this apartment is very small. We stayed here with five people and it was very cramped. Without air conditioning,it is also very hot in the summer. The back room has a bit of mold/mildew on the ceiling which appears to be coming from a leak in the water pipe next to the loud generator in the back. While Lev was very nice,"I would not stay here again with any number of people more than two. \"",,,
5743939,46090818,2015-09-07,27881874,Liz,"Lev was absolutely amazing. Made us feel right at home and made our trip extremely convenient.

Lev constantly communicates with us about our stays, and bends over backwards to make sure that we feel comfortable and happy while we're there."

"\"",,,,,
5743939,76430240,2016-05-27,23685148,Lynn,"We stayed at Lev's place for 4 nights. I'd like to mention that way before we'd even arrived Lev was a great help with all my questions regarding transport (just a sidenote: do check out his app Wanderu, it's fantastic and very easy to use)."
"Check-in was smooth and easy. Before we arrived Lev gave us an extremely detailed \"\"manual\"\" to ensure that everything was communicated to perfection. The apartment was very conveniently located",just a couple of minutes walk from the subway and there're convenience stores and cafes just around the corner. It was also in a very quiet neighbourhood so if you don't like too much hustle and bustle this is where you should be staying.,,,,
What I liked most about the place,just to name a few:,,,,
1) Two bedrooms with comfy double beds. Lev will even provide you with a mattress if you have more than 4 guests.,,,,,
2) Apple TV - need I say more?! We were glued to it every single night.,,,,,
3) Washer and dryer,,,,,
4) You're free to whip up a nice family meal during your stay - Lev was super generous with providing oil and other spices,and fruit/eggs etc. And we had a blast!,,,,

Beyond that he went out of his way to help us with fun snacks and great help when we accidentally broke something at his place and we were searching for a place to purchase a replacement.
His property is ideally located to the most important places in Boston like the Commons,Freedom Trail,State Capital,"and the Esplanade.\"",,
5743939,85976996,2016-07-14,34368218,Erin,Lev was a wonderful host and quickly answered any questions we had. Check in was clear and uncomplicated. Beacon Hill is a charming neighborhood. Lev's apartment delivered everything promised and was a convenient and comfortable place to stay.

5743939,87909667,2016-07-22,83293461,Sheri,Lev was awesome. He communicated early and often. He stocked the fridge with fresh juice and milk -- and had coffee pods all set for my morning caffeine infusion.
The place was sweet. I loved padding around the apartment. So much homier than a hotel downtown. And the location was perfect perfect PERFECT for my Boston walking obsession. Right near the Longfellow Bridge and Charles River paths.,,,,,
I will so stay here again.,,,,,
OH! The pillows in the back bedroom were better than the Westin's!,,,,,
"One note: Don't eat at the Italian place right below the apt. They are rather rude and the food is mediocre. \"",,,,,

He made sure we knew he was available for anything regarding his apartment. He was very flexible and transparent with us regarding his thoughts and expectations for the rental. The pictures reflect the rental and the location was awesome. We had 2 adults and 4 kids and even had some visitors and the apartment space accommodated us very well. Just as FYI, the apartment is in the city and a fire department is close by, so be prepared for some noise. Having restaurants and Whole foods so close was perfect for getting food quickly for my kids. The apartment was well kept, very neat and clean. Lev - Thank you so much for making our stay such a pleasant experience. All the best!"
5743939,91475339,2016-08-05,11224138,Stefan,Lev war ein hervorragender Gastgeber. Die Kommunikation vor der Ankunft und während des Aufenthalts war sehr gut und immer unkompliziert. Die Unterkunft ist sehr zentral gelegen und verfügt über zwei richtige Betten mit guten Matratzen. Das eine Zimmer ist infolge der Strasse ein wenig lärmausgesetzt.
5743939,92410726,2016-08-08,2104568,Matt,"Lev sent us everything we needed ahead of time, including recommendations for places to go, and even stocked some supplies in the fridge before we arrived! He was very quick to reply to messages, and extremely helpful. Highly recommended!"

His place is great for business travels and exploring town alike,as it is close to everything exciting(!),but also situated in an absolutely perfect location close to the redline T from where you can go literally anywhere in the public transport perimeter with least transfers. Has good internet,great grocery stores such as WholeFoods etc within 2min walk,5 minute walk to Boston Common,Charles river promenade
"Thanks again Lev for a lovely stay and great recommendations to restaurants and all of that (we went to both your recommendations in the end - loved both!). Also for accommodating us on such very short notice. We couldn't have hoped for a better place to have ended up in!\"",,,,,

1732804,7936370,2013-10-08,9163063,Cécile,Thomas was a great host and very kind! He gave us some great recommendations about Boston. We enjoyed our stay at Thomas' home. The room was nice and breakfast awsome. The house is situated in a nice neighborhood and the next subway station is quite close (10 minutes walking). Thomas' dog Wonder is very friendly - nothing to worry about!
1732804,8302706,2013-10-24,215763,Sonali,"I spend a week in Thomas place and I was so please with everything, seriously, Thomas is the best host ever!! Even know This is a bed and breakfast place, most hostes just offer you the bed except for Thomas, he take his time to offer you a great healthy and variety breakfast every single morning. The neighborhood is very safe and quiet, it's very well connected to the center of the city, only 5 metro stops more or less. The dog is very friendly and quiet( not as big as it looks on the pic)"
I really feel like home in Thomas place and I'm gonna miss the outstanding breakfast he offer. If I ever go to Boston again,I will definitely come back to Tomas place.,,,,
By the way,"the bed feels like heaven! Thank you againg for everything Thomas!!!\"",,,,

Thomas was friendly,"outgoing and welcoming.  I unconditionally recommend him as a host.\"",,,,
1732804,11692248,2014-04-12,13381937,Kirk,"Tom is very easy to communicate with.  We exchanged texts, emails, and phone calls before we got there.  Tom was there to greet us and helped bring in our luggage.  We met his dog Wonder who was a real sweetheart."
We went to dinner both nights we were there,"staying in the \"\"'hood\"\" to get the flavor of the area.  Both suggestions were #5 on a scale of 1 - 5.  Tom also provided great insight into transportation options in Boston","and we were able to get downtown with no problems.\"",,,
1732804,12949116,2014-05-15,6970849,Byron,"Thomas was very nice and helpful before and during our visit.  As there is only one guest bedroom and Thomas works days, we basically had a private residence.  For the excellent price, the accommodations were as expected, not high end but comfortable.  The king bed was quite comfortable.  Internet access was slow and no TV is provided.  The dog was a non-issue, well behaved and not intrusive.  Street parking worked well for us, but felt lucky to find a convenient place each time."
1732804,13458122,2014-05-27,7048939,Lauren,"Chris and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Tom. He was very easy to get in touch with when we needed him. The house was exactly how he described- it was absolutely beautiful! In a very charming neighborhood.  We really appreciated the extra touches that Tom made to make our stay even more special. Without hesitation we would stay there again, and certainly recommend to all."
1732804,13714719,2014-06-02,11912380,Anne,It was a really nice treat staying at Tom's place. He has a beautiful spacious home in a quiet and leafy suburb of Boston which is about a 15min walk to Shawmut station (about 6 stops into the City centre).
The room itself was a great size for the two of us and full of natural light. The bed was huge (king) and extremely comfortable!,,,,,
Tom was such a courteous and generous host,he always made sure we had fruit and snacks aplenty and was more than happy offering us specific recommendations and help with anything else that we needed.,,,,
Wonder liked to bark here and there but wasn't a problem. She'd always be receptive to a pat too.,,,,,
"Overall an extremely pleasant stay with a thoughtful host!\"",,,,,
1732804,14667944,2014-06-23,16969808,Jon,"My mother and I stayed with Tom for two nights in June 2014, and we had a wonderful stay. Tom was a very congenial host who made sure that we were welcome to Boston. He made coffee for us each morning, recommended several restaurants and activities for us, and also offered us dinner (steak & asparagus!) when he hosted some of his friends on the second night (all of whom were awesome). You won't be disappointed if you stay with Tom!"
1732804,15445683,2014-07-09,13942742,Tony,"Thomas was an absolutely delightful host. He was warm and engaging from the onset, made us feel comfortable in his home, was obliging and helpful readily imparting his local knowledge which was a real bonus for us. He is to be highly recommended as an airbnb host."
1732804,15842858,2014-07-16,5484257,Frank & Shelly,My girlfriend and I spent a four day weekend at Tom's and couldn't be happier with our choice!
Pros: Super large bed. Out of the way host,we rarely saw him which is good and bad because he's such a nice guy. 10 minute walking distance from a train into downtown. Friendly,approachable and great communication. Clean apartment. Access to the kitchen. Super friendly dog! (We loved Wonder),,,
Cons: Street parking although we didn't have any problems finding any spots. Didn't really find too many local food places but that might be because we didn't have time to explore the area for some late night food. If you really really really have an issue with dogs,Tom does have a dog (But honestly,Wonder was amazing,we loved her and we can't see very many people having any issues with her),,
We would totally recommend staying with Tom to friends and anyone that would listen.,,,,,
Thanks Tom and Wonder!,,,,,
"July 2014\"",,,,,
1732804,16756263,2014-08-01,19064218,Alex,"Thomas was a gracious host; I was coming into Boston to see someone through a medical procedure and quite worried, but Thomas was incredibly reassuring, even meeting me at the train station and making sure I got to his place. The room and apartment were beautiful, spacious, and temperate, and the neighborhood was quiet and quaint, just what I needed. I ended up spending a majority of my time and both nights in town at my friend's house for support, but used Thomas' place as a base of operations. He was very clear and trusting with directions for passing off the keys and accommodating with hours. Can't recommend more highly."
"His dog is wonderful.\"",,,,,
1732804,16884768,2014-08-04,5126641,Michael,"Tom was away canoeing for the weekend when we stayed, so unfortunately we didn't get to meet him. He certainly made the place comfortable and inviting for us, and he kept in touch with us throughout our stay, to make sure we were ok. We would definitely recommend other people to stay with him."
1732804,17217797,2014-08-09,17521367,Madelin,"This was the first time my boyfriend and I had ever used Airbnb and we both agree that it was a wonderful experience. While we were on the hunt for lodging, we took other's reviews into consideration and Thomas had very good ones. He was a very gracious host and really easy to get along with. He was also quick to respond to emails and texts as well as gave us some great suggestions on things to do/what was going on in town while we were there. He is a very genuine guy and didn't ever make us feel awkward or uncomfortable in any way."
The place had a lovely Boston charm and there weren't any unexpected surprises not listed on the website. One could take a bus from the subway to a stop about two blocks away from his house,but it was only a 12-15minute walk to the station.,,,,
Even though we only stayed for three nights and weren't there most of the day,we cooked dinner at Thomas's house twice. Everything worked well and was easy to find-- just make sure to not put food down the drain because there isn't a garbage disposal.,,,,
"Tom has a dog named Wonder and she is adorable. \"\"Give her a treat and you'll have a friend forever\"\" was what we were told and it was true. She barked as us when we first arrived",as expected,but then she didn't bark at us again. She really is a great dog.,,,
Needless to say,"we would stay at Tom's again if we ever find ourselves in Boston.\"",,,,
1732804,17730678,2014-08-16,18386979,Sebastiaan,"Thomas replied very quickly to all of our messages, eve sending an alternative driving route because it was raining heavily on the day of our arrival. Tom is a great host, welcoming us together with wonder, his dog. We had a couple of drinks on the first night and got some nice insights about Boston and the USA. The house is situated in a quiet neighbourhood and is spacious and nicely decorated.Parking was no problem. Our room was nice, clean and air conditioned. We stayed for two nights and felt at home straight away.Tom left us breakfast and we made our own coffee. Tom allowed us to pick our luggage on the evening of  the checkout date, which came in very handy because of our late flight. Public transport is close by. A great place to stay when visiting Boston. We recommend it!"
1732804,18387543,2014-08-25,6589880,Deanna,"Thomas quickly responded to our inquiry, and gave us detailed directions  on location and instructions on how to enter the apartment.  Even though we weren't able to meet Thomas (we only needed to stay a total of 7 hours), the apartment was clean and he even set up the coffee for our early morning departure.  We had no problems or issues.  This was a perfect location near Boston/Logan Airport and we would recommend his private room."
1732804,18847885,2014-09-01,9624762,Anna,"Tom was very helpful and he met us at the stations, so we didn't get lost upon arrival. He also got the breakfast ready for us every day!"
1732804,19004066,2014-09-04,19420881,Qi Ang,"Thomas is a really nice man,we arrive very late on Sep 2,and he also give us very warm welcome and give us advise about the place of visit in Boston. It just like you are staying in your friends house. Breakfast was delicious,coffee,cakes,and other fruits. I like the backyard so much,quite and peaceful,full of flowers where you can get close to the plants and fresh air. We had very good sleep these two nights,the bed was so big and comfortable. If I will come to Boston again, I will definitely live in Thomas's house again."
1732804,19448321,2014-09-12,18066962,Juan,"Tom fue muy atento y amable con nosotros, así como su mascota Wonder. La habitación y su casa en general nos parecieron limpia, confortable, acogedora y espaciosa. El barrio nos pareció muy tranquilo."
1732804,19558165,2014-09-14,16070255,Curry,"Thomas was a wonderful host and his home was charming.  Great Vietnamese restaurant in the neighborhood.  His dog, Wonder, is adorable!"
1732804,19851088,2014-09-19,2281736,Noah,"Thomas was an incredible host. He communicated instantly with us and continue to communicate anything we needed and was available at all times if anything came up. He left his key, allowed us to take that out and even was okay with us coming back late from our conferences around midnight. Fresh coffee was available every morning, along with pastries and fruit. Thomas even texted us to arrange the bathroom schedule to ensure having only one bathroom wasn't an issue. I would highly recommend Thomas's place to anyone that didn't mind being 20 minutes outside the city."
1732804,19900742,2014-09-20,19223688,Guillermo,"Tom was an amazing host. He gave us good advice on how to move around Boston. He was also very friendly and flexible with check-in time. Communication was clear and swift. The room and bathroom were very clean. The bed was comfortable. Finally, Tom gave us coffee and home-made banana bread for breakfast."
1732804,20135646,2014-09-24,9669377,Steve,"Thomas was very helpful with directions, helpful hints for seeing Boston. His house was secure and well-located near a T (subway) station. And his dog welcomed me too. And the big bed was extremely comfortable!"

He has a lovely dog called Wanda who hardly made a peep, made banana loaf for my stay & showed me to a great local Vietnamese for dinner. I'd recommend staying here if you're looking for a comfortable homely stay with a great host."
1732804,20946219,2014-10-08,9021638,Bill,"Stayed in Tom’s wonderful house over a week, clean, warm and conformable."

Tom’s dog Wonder is also very welcome guest,I finally asked to take photo together with her,as she is very interesting.,,,

Firstly, he met me at the subway station and invited me to join him for dinner - - dinner is not usually provided but he said he wanted to test out his idea to offer a meal ( for a fee ) to visitors. And he is a great cook! We had some wine and great conversation, and he helped me plan my itinerary the following day. This was my first visit to Boston and Tom was so helpful, and pointed out the \"\"hidden gems\"\"of Boston.  His house is very pretty and comfortable"

He was very responsive and gave great recommendations on things to do in Boston. It was walking distance to the T, so very easy to get to downtown. He also had breakfast ready for us, and it was delicious! Would definitely recommend this for your stay."
1732804,21567801,2014-10-19,4143158,Matt,I enjoyed staying with Thomas. Very nice guy to talk to and his home was comfortable and clean.  It's a little way from the center but it's good value in comparison to other options in Boston. Recommended.
1732804,21989862,2014-10-27,8886331,Henry,We had a great experience with Thomas Reale. He was a great host and very gracious with his time. He went the extra mile to help us out. Thank you. It was one of the best overall experiences I have had at airbnb. The apartment is beautiful and very comfortable. I would highly recommend this listing.
1732804,22550248,2014-11-09,3395929,Chi-San Johnson,"\"If you ask me to sum up my experience at Thomas's place in one word, I'd definitely use \"\"awesome\"\"."
I was there in Boston for a weekend break from New York and I was looking for a place which was reasonably priced,relatively spacious and not necessarily in the heart of the city as I would like to slow down a little. Thomas's place fit the bill perfectly. The first thing I found very reassuring was that it was 100% WYSIWYG,that meant I could enjoy the spacious and classy living room,the super comfy king size bed with an wide array of pillows,a homey kitchen where I can enjoy a nice coffee (and cook if I want,but I didn't) and a classic bathtub which I still silently screamed at when I finally saw it for real. The best thing is Thomas kept the whole apartment super clean. It felt like a 5-star hotel suite. In the cold late autumn days
Thomas's apartment is not in the busiest part of the city,but I never found the location inconvenient because it was served by the efficient red line that took me straight to the centre in 20 minutes. Every morning there I enjoyed a very nice walk from his place to the subway station (just walk straight,zero difficulty for the direction idiots) through the charming and safe neighbourhood. I was there in early November and the idyllic scenery and foliage in the street formed part of my fondest memory about Boston.,,,
My BnB experience would not be perfect without Thomas's great hospitality. I arrived at Boston on a cold and rainy afternoon and I was surprised that he picked me up at the subway station. I was so grateful for his offer but it rendered all the useful instructions he diligently gave me beforehand useless ;-p Being a gourmet and an art lover,Thomas gave me excellent advice on places to eat and visit in Boston. We had very good chats on a lot of things like friends when he was around and he even invited me to one of his dinner gatherings with friends one evening in a chic gastropub (I dunno what they call it there),which was a fantastic culinary and cocktail adventure. The delectable muffins and banana cakes he made every morning made my stay the most authentic BnB experience ever. If I return to Boston in the future,"I would be really happy to stay in Thomas's place once again.\"",,
1732804,28193716,2015-03-19,3198229,Cassandra,"Thomas was a delight! The condo is in a quiet neighborhood with ample parking on top of the hill that was bathed in beautiful light all day, it seemed. The bed was almost too comfortable, if that's possible. With less than a 10 minute walk to the redline I was able to get downtown easily and efficiently. I would stay here again and recommend it to my friends."
1732804,32294803,2015-05-16,5784728,Anke,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Thomas and Wonder the dog for two nights in May and it was great.  His house is beautiful and so is the neighborhood with it's authentic Boston triple-deckers. The bedroom is just as it is in the picture and the bed is huge. Tom asked us about any food allergies before we arrived and had a terrific gluten-free banana bread waiting for us when we arrived. During the day he stayed in touch with great tips for restaurants or sights. Great guy, great host."
1732804,33340618,2015-05-26,32891483,Dominik,"\"Thomas hat mich perfekt empfangen und hat auch immer dafür gesorgt, dass ich mich wohl fühle. Ich habe direkt etwas zum trinken angeboten bekommen und es lagen sogar Muffins bereit. Am nächsten Tag hat Thomas sogar noch Bananenbrot gebacken, welche \"\"awesome\"\" waren!"
Wir haben uns in der Stadt getroffen und Thomas hat mir tolle Ecken und Viertel gezeigt. Wir hatten einen ausgiebigen Spaziergang. Die Wohnung ist wie beschrieben. Die Lage ist außerhalb und sehr ruhig. Ich habe sehr gut geschlafen. Mit der Bahn habe ich ca. 30 Minuten gebraucht und war im Zentrum.,,,,,

1732804,33606327,2015-05-30,33060682,Kate,"Thomas was a wonderful host and I felt immediately as if I was in my own home, which is how I like to feel when traveling. His sweet and friendly dog added to that feeling. The neighborhood is a lovely and quiet residential neighborhood with restaurants and shops nearby. It’s a short walk to the “T” or you can take a bus at the corner. You can be in downtown Boston in less than 30 minutes. Thomas is ready with ideas, maps and advice if you need it, and also very respectful and unobtrusive. The king size bed was very comfortable—even better than at home! There is a small but lovely back porch for breakfast if you want to sit outside. (And he makes a great cup of coffee and muffins!) Thanks Thomas for your fine hospitality!"
1732804,36076209,2015-06-24,4417634,Sharon,"Tom was a very friendly, gracious host. He made sure to know when I would be arriving and communicated effectively. The house was described accurately and the neighborhood is very nice. Tom even asked if I had any allergies.  He also went above and beyond by providing real cream for morning coffee. I would definitely stay here again."
1732804,38073152,2015-07-12,4024109,Chris (First Name 'Pamela'),"Tom made us feel welcome and was on site when we arrived, which we appreciate. One of the neighbors welcomed us to the area when we were getting into our car. The parking worked out fine."

Tom was so professional, accommodating and kind. He had my room all set up when I arrived, made me breakfast and coffee (not something typically done with this type of housing, from what I hear), and was the perfect blend of conversational while also respecting my space. His pup Wonder is also a sweetheart. :) I would absolutely, whole-heartedly, recommend Tom for anyone interested in staying in this area. It was such a pleasant experience."
1732804,47673580,2015-09-21,35735256,Cameron,Could not have had a better stay.
Tom is the perfect host in every way. He is friendly,welcoming and hospitable. He is also a great cool,and really good company (as his his gorgeous dog Wonder) Everything about my stay is faultless. The apartment is awesome,the room huge,bed comfy and the area really nice. Only a short walk to the T (metro) and a quick trip into the City centre area.,
I was very fortunate to meet some of Tom's friends and neighbours,which was a perfect enhancement to my trip,and made my stay better than I could ever have imagined.,,,
"Look no further if you're staying in a Boston..Tom's place is the best.. \"",,,,,
1732804,49844853,2015-10-06,10557516,Carmela,"Thomas was a very responsive and caring host. Although he was out of town during my stay, he was sure to make sure the place was comfortable for me upon my arrival. He also checked in periodically via text message and promptly answered any questions I had. The room was cozy and the bed was very comfortable."
1732804,50369510,2015-10-11,30193452,Kate,"We stayed with Tom for 2 nights in his lovely home. The neighbourhood is really quiet and pretty.  The house is just gorgeous and he'd thought of everything we could need.  Lovely soft towels and a selection of little toiletries. The bed is so comfy!  Tom is a wonderful host,  welcoming us warmly and the inclusion of home made breakfast muffins just goes above and beyond! He's a lovely guy and so easy to get on with.  His dog Wonder is very sweet and friendly. The station is a short walk away and then you can be in downtown boston in about 20 mins. Tom kindly recommended a couple of places; The local Vietnamese is really good and Mead hall in the town has 100 beers to try. ..couldn't have been better recommended for us!  We'd definitely stay with Tom again and hope to plan another trip real soon :-)"
1732804,51045120,2015-10-17,8515485,Andreas,"Where to begin! Tom and Wonder were amazing hosts. Tom welcomed us as we approached the apartment and helped us take our bags in. This kind and helpful gesture was one of many during our stay. With recommendations on where to eat, suggestions on things to see and do, coffee and treats in the morning, we cannot say enough good about our experience with Tom and Wonder. We have used airbnb in many cities and countries and both agree Tom and Wonder's home was our favorite for comfort (who doesn't love a cozy room and king sized bed), vicinity to public transit (10 minute walk), and kindness of our host. We HIGHLY recommend staying with Tom when in Boston, and giving Wonder a pat on the head for us."
1732804,52471619,2015-10-29,24907966,Robert,Tom was a great host. Like crashing with an old friend. Room was very comfortable.  And Wonder the Wonder Dog is very sweet.  The neighborhood is charming and extremely convenient for my purposes.

His home is full of beautiful photographies he took plus Wonder 's presence is very welcoming too. Everything felt homey. Very clean and spacious; towels and linens are soft and Thomas put extra care into preparing  delicious coffee. The pictures are accurate,it was even better.We wish Thomas the best for his photographies expos coming soon and really recommand this host and his home!,,,,

1732804,72669970,2016-05-04,35328530,Nick,"Our stay with Thomas was above and beyond what I was expecting from an Airbnb host. He had excellent suggestions for the city and even made breakfast for us during our stay! Highly recommend staying here, very clean and polite. His dog, wonder, was a total sweetheart too."
1732804,74526107,2016-05-15,61549615,William,"My wife and I just completed a 4 night stay with Thomas. He was a terrific host, truly interested in our experience. That experience included daily trips into downtown Boston and each night we would relax and share with Thomas what we had done. Over a glass of wine we would share stories and he would give his recommendations for the next day's adventures."
The room was exactly as advertised. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and the bathroom was clean and always accessible. We enjoyed sitting in Thomas' front room with him the most. He's a very fun guy with terrific life experiences he will share if asked.,,,,,
The neighborhood didn't seem to have much to offer except being really fun to walk through on the way to the metro station. The three story dwellings are very interesting and apparently originated in this area! In truth,we didnt exlore the neighborhood in detail as we were always on our way to the city.,,,,
The metro red-line was a fun experience to master. And with Thomas' help we became master riders. The station is perhaps a 10 minute (maybe 15) walk through some beautiful neighborhoods. We never felt unsafe. We did however resort to Uber each night from the station because of my wife's tired feet. It is only a $4.65 ride from the station back to Thomas' place.,,,,,
Thomas works an irregular schedule that has him home at times and gone at times but we never felt unwelcome nor in the way. We actually felt we were perhaps taking up too much of his personal time with our visits but he never indicated that at all.,,,,,
In closing,we would stay with Thomas again without a doubt. He is genuine,interesting,and engaging. And has a terrific companion in his dog Wonder.,,
"Thank you for allowing us into your home!\"",,,,,
1732804,76561631,2016-05-28,70238039,Mark,"Just finished a week in Dorchester with Thomas and Wonder the Dog. Doing some research, mostly at the JFK Library, so the location was perfect."
Tom and Wonder are fabulous hosts. Tom sent me a message very soon after making the reservation and he was always easy to reach and very responsive. And he seems as laid back as you want him to be. Need directions or restaurant recommendations? He's your man. Need a dinner or walking companion? He's your man. Want to be left alone to read,work,watch tv? He can do that,too. Whatever you need,he's willing to accommodate. Very kind and knowledgeable,Dorchester's greatest booster.
The room has a small closet,a dresser,and a huge comfy bed. Plenty of natural light. I slept better there than I usually do at home. The bathroom was clean,always accessible,and the living and dining rooms are full of Tom's wonderful photography and some great plants (check out those cacti in the dining room!). The kitchen had whatever I needed. AND Tom made corn muffins and banana bread,had fresh fruit
Dorchester was wonderful. Quiet,lots of walkers,plenty of dining options. The closest T station is Shawmut. I walked there in about 10-15 minutes. There's also a Stop & Shop within walking distance. And,again,if you need to know where anything else is,just ask Tom.
This was my first Airbnb experience,so didn't know what to expect. But I couldn't have had a better experience. Thanks,"Tom! See you next time!\"",,,
1732804,77821849,2016-06-03,17464099,Austin,I had a very nice stay with Thomas and would definitely stay in his lovely home again. Thanks!

Thomas is a really nice person which is why it was also had dinner together a couple of times. The room was absolutely fine, just as described. I can highly recommend!"
1732804,87923328,2016-07-22,50408178,Christophe,"Tom was really nice from the begining to the end, he gave me lot of tips to visit the city even before coming home as the way to come from the airport to the house. He took me to a party with his friends so génisses really open minded ! He is passionated by what he does and you can feel it when you talk to him."
The house is really nice,clean and confortable. The bed is just awesome !,,,,

He provided me with all the information on nearby breakfast joints. And thats not it- he has a dog named wonder and she is really cute and welcoming too.

He greeted me on the front porch when I pulled up, helped me get situated, and then even invited me to the beach and dinner with his friend, Leighanne. Every morning he had Tea, fruit, and some pastry he baked waiting in the kitchen. His dog, Wonder, is a gem and easy to around. He even offered to let me stay an extra day when my apartment situation was looking rough. Plus he has some great photography. Thomas was very clearly a super host for a reason and I wouldn't think twice about staying at this Airbnb again!"

Furnishings are simple, but you have everything you need. The super comfortable beds are a particular highlight. South End Hospitality was easy to communicate with and professional from start to finish. We didn't have any issues during our stay, but I know they would have been addressed properly if we had. Would definitely stay here again if I need a place in JP in the future."

We were a party of 2 couples, and there was ample room for us.  We had a few small hiccups our first day--things like a doorknob not working properly.  These were addressed immediately with a quick message and speedy response.  There was easy access to the Green Street T station, which was great as we spent most of our trip doing as many touristy things as we could fit in.  The walk back from the T at night was a bit sketchy, at least in our eyes.  We never had a situation arise that made us feel particularly unsafe, but at night we always felt the need to be especially aware of our surroundings.  Other than that, we had a great stay."

The area was within a 10-15 min walk of shops and restaurants and easy to get a lyft from. I'm not sure I would have felt comfortable walking on my own at night but during the day was fine.

It was clean, bright and cheerful with a very user-friendly kitchen.  The space is attached to owners' home and I was concerned about noise transfer but it was super quiet. The queen bed was comfy and the cable TV with dvd player were nice to have. Free wifi added to our convenience.  I did not meet the hosts but they were in contact via email and were clearly invested in providing a positive experience. Getting the key was simple and needed info was available in the unit. Location was good with walking distance to Centre St amenities. Had a great breakfast at clearly popular Robinwood Cafe nearby.  Street parking sometimes took a couple minutes to find a space but always found something within a 3 minute walk. Would be more than happy to stay here again if needed.  : )"

1071235,5848038,2013-07-19,5695419,Diana,This is a great studio in a wonderfully cultural town.  Lots of places to eat and shops to wander in.  Chris & Kristina are fabulous hosts; friendly and helpful with whatever you need.  I look forward to being able to stay there again.  We highly recommend it.

It was clean, comfortable, and costs much less than what my parents had spent the last time they were in town at a not so great hotel near Fenway. Next time they come, we'll definitely look into booking this airbnb again!"
1071235,6912492,2013-08-30,6893618,Deborah,"This was a great little, light airy studio, separate from the main house, in a sweet residential neighborhood of Jamaica Plain.  Just a 10 minute or so walk to the main streets of shops and restaurants (downtown), and about 10-15 min. walk in the other direction to the Orange Line T, which is a quick ride to downtown Boston."
Totally convenient,and the hosts were very helpful,responsive and accommodating.,,,
Sorry we couldn't have stayed longer,and I would recommend this place to anyone,"and would stay here again on a future terip to Boston\"",,,
1071235,7016684,2013-09-03,7806425,Wesley,My stay was great! The studio was perfect for my mother and I and it was walking distances to many places to eat. I would definitely recommend staying here.
1071235,7159297,2013-09-09,7373309,Rachel,"This was my very first Air BNB experience (and visit to Boston), and I cannot say enough nice things about it! Even other family and friends who were staying in other Air BNB places in Boston were jealous of our little studio in Jamaica Plain."
When I visit Boston again,I do no hesitate to stay in Chris & Kristina's beautiful and comfortable studio apartment again. The pictures on profile do not lie - it is filled with light,and colorful walls + art,but also very comfortable and accessible. There was always ample parking,and a very quiet peacefulness that was a much needed respite from our whirlwind weekend.,
The neighborhood is beyond adorable,and very close to the T,and a ton of restaurants and cafes. There was even a recommendation list in the well-stocked kitchen of places to eat/see locally.,,,
We never met the homeowners,but were given ample communication about check-in/out,where the key was,and if we ever needed anything to simply call them. We were even able to check in a few hours early since there were no immediate previous guests.,,
This place is perfect for a single person,or couple,looking for a calming getaway in a great location. We hope to get back soon!,,,

We appreciated the convenience of having a kitchen and it was a short walk to the transit station. Although we didn't get a chance to meet our hosts, we were able to communicate with Chris and Kristina via text.   We definitely recommend their studio and would love to stay there again the next time we are in town."
1071235,7583921,2013-09-25,8230593,Aurore,"Chris and Kristina were very nice persons. Smily, kind... and so comprehensive when my dad lost the key.... especially Sunday at... 11.15pm."
The apt. is nice,big enough and so calm as the neighborhood (Which is sooo cute).,,,,
You definitively have to book at their place!,,,,,

1071235,8111405,2013-10-16,7854448,Andrew,The apartment made a great launching point for our exploration of Boston and vicinity.  The nearby T station provided a great and inexpensive way to get around town and to and from the airport.  Kristina's recommendations for concert venues and dining were spot on.  We might add that having your landlord next door is also good to take care of the small glitches that may arise.
1071235,8216989,2013-10-21,8713514,Marc,"We enjoyed staying in Chris and Kristina's studio apartment in Jamaica Plain. We were there to visit our son and his fiancée who live about three blocks from the studio, so it was the most convenient location possible. The studio was very comfortable, with a large bedroom with a very comfortable queen sized bed, space to hang clothes and a TV/DVD player, a breakfast alcove, a full-size kitchen and a nice big bathroom with a terrific shower, was very comfortable. It was spotlessly clean and decorated with original artwork.  It is very cozy and had a private entrance at the rear of the hosts' house so that we could come and go as we pleased without disturbing them. Kristina was available by text or phone to take care of a couple of questions and requests. She delivered a hair dryer and an extra pillow within minutes after we asked for them."
Just a couple of blocks down the road is the shopping area of Jamaica Plain which has all the usual chain stores as well as lots of charming or quirky local businesses.,,,,,
Such a nice change from hotels...and a charming quiet neighborhood easily accessible to the rest of Boston by MBTA  (the T) or by car.,,,,,

1071235,8294032,2013-10-24,3228194,Melissa,"Almost everything was perfect with our stay at Kristina + Chris' place.  It was a great location, close to the T and good restaurants/bars.  The room was comfy - absolutely no issues there.  Kristina's communication was top notch - always available via text and friendly."
"Our one minor snafu was that the people renting the upstairs studio had a small child who was crazy loud and jumpy.  We love to sleep in and it just wasn't an option with people stomping overhead.  When Kristina learned of this issue she contacted the other renters to ask them to be more respectful which was kind of her.  I would rent from them again - just get the upstairs studio next time!!  \"",,,,,
1071235,8431843,2013-10-30,8962950,Rodrigo,"Everything was super clean, neat, and as shown in the pictures or even better!"
Kristina was an excellent host and warmly welcomed us the first day. Great tips for local places to eat/buy food/pharmacy/etc were left in the Studio including a map,which was really helpful,after unpacking we could easily find a great place to dinner just a few blocks away,Ten Tables,superb!!,
The neighborhood is lovely and very tranquil,really enjoyed our walks from and to the T line. All in all Five stars,and hope we could have stayed longer in Boston at this Cozy studio,,,
"Thank you Kristina!!\"",,,,,
1071235,8478132,2013-11-02,6693415,Daniel,Wonderful apartment in an absolutely beautiful neighbourhood. Jamaica Plain is easy to reach the city centre from and there are good bars and restaurants within walking distance. Try the tapas bar/record shop round the corner for Hendrix with chorizo. Kristina and Chris were really helpful and really quick with communications. Would definitely go back!
1071235,8536795,2013-11-04,82409,Ashley,"Chris and Kristina's studio was perfect for our weekend in Boston. It was super clean and so cute when we arrived, with everything we could have needed. Our hosts were very kind and helpful with direction and very quick responces during our reservation process. The studio is in a beautiful and friendly neighborhood that was only 2 stops by train to the heart of Boston. I recommend leaving your car and taking the train because-was we found out-Boston traffic can get bad and parking can get pretty expensive too. Leaving our car parked at the studio for free was a far better option for us and Boston is a great city to navigate on foot. Thank you Chris and Kristina for making Our stay so great! Hope to see you again in Boston, our new favorite city!"
1071235,8601100,2013-11-07,2022106,Robert,"Chris & Kristina are great hosts. They made check-in very easy for us, and when we arrived there was a homemade guide to their local neighbourhood, Jamaica Plain, which listed bars, restaurants and cafés in the area."
The studio is great and has everything you could possibly need for your stay,including a comfortable bed,excellent hot shower and one of the best equipped kitchens of any I have seen on my Airbnb travels. Some of the artwork in the studio is by Chris & Kristina's family and this was a really nice touch.,,,
From the list of local businesses Chris & Kristina recommended,we loved breakfast at Caffe Aromi which did great coffee and red pepper scones. Simply amazing.,,,,
Kristina popped around on our first evening to give us some tips on getting to and from Boston. 3-4 minutes walking should get you to Stony Brook station from which you can catch a train to Downtown Boston (less than 15 minutes' travel time on the T). Chris & Kristina's studio is very conveniently located,and the neighbourhood felt very safe at all times. We were able to park on the street outside without the need for pay & display parking.,,,,
"Chris & Kristina were excellent hosts and their studio is the perfect base from which to explore all that Boston has to offer.\"",,,,,
1071235,8803288,2013-11-18,4445661,Rory,"We spent two nights in Chris and Kristina's lovely studio. It offered everything we needed: a clean, quiet, comfortable space in a darling neighborhood. There are plenty of shops and things to do within walking distance, and the neighborhood has that charming Boston look and feel. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
1071235,9268333,2013-12-17,9689574,Gayle,They thought of everything... Maps for the neighborhood. Restaurant suggestions that are within walking distance from the house.

There were sweet touches like a framed child's painting hung on the wall and bright, color coordinated towels/bathroom rug. The studio is very well situated - easy walk to shops and the T stop. Though we never met the hosts, Chris and Kristina, in person, they were very easy to communicate with. We had a great time and would love to stay here again."
1071235,10020590,2014-01-26,1343675,Stephen,"Very comfortable and cozy place to call home for a few days. I really liked the neighborhood - plenty of cafes and restaurants, and an easy walk to the T station. Chris & Kristina were VERY accommodating for my early arrival time and late check-out, and were quick to respond to my questions."
The studio was kept nice and warm despite the near-zero temperatures outside,and was well provisioned with cooking gear.,,,,

The kitchen was well equipped and Kristina was very responsive to any questions i had.   Jamaica Plain, where the studio is located, is a fun place with lots of neighborhood character and still very convenient to public transportation to downtown Boston. It was just a short walk from the studio to many little eateries, coffee shops and ice cream places. Since I stayed here for three weeks i had time to explore many of them!  I would highly recommend this studio."
1071235,11592361,2014-04-08,8821241,Elodie,We definitely recommend Chris and Kristina studio!!!!!! The location is very convinient and the studio very pleasant and functional. I definitely recommend this place to anyone. We have had a great time to Boston and feel like home.

Chris and Kristina were great hosts, with plenty of suggestions upon our arrival. They are answered all of our questions about the neighborhood quickly and efficiently. The location is terrific, just a short ride outside the city and easily accessible by the T.  It was extra helpful to have a kitchen to use while we were staying there as well. It was very private, clean and quite a convenient place to stay. We would love to visit again!"

They were nice enough to let us check in early as well which was a huge relief since we came into Boston on a red eye.  We didn't get a chance to meet in person but Kristina was very communicative while we were there.  We'll absolutely be back the next time we're in Boston.
1071235,12383360,2014-04-30,14338381,Gary,"Me, my wife and our 8 month old daughter enjoyed our stay at this lovely studio. Kristina's hospitality was excellent and it really made our vacation.

Clean, welcoming and (URL HIDDEN) parents settled in and felt relaxed in this charming studio! My mom is the type of individual who has maaaaany inquires during travel and was not shy about calling the host a few times over her stay.

I really fell in love with Jamaica Plain and would recommend wandering around Centre Street to  anyone who is staying in Chris and Kristina's apartment. The space itself was comfortable and had everything we needed, including coffee, movies, and an extremely helpful map of the area with points of interest clearly marked. Kris, though we never got to meet I really appreciate the small touches that made this apartment such as easy place to stay in Boston."

It's a couple of minutes walk to the public transport which takes you straight into Boston, but the JP area is also nice (try the Grass Fed Burgers!). The apt is cozy and clean and Kristina is a very happy and friendly host. Great recommendations. The area is safe and pleasant! We'd love to have spent more time :-)"

The place was well presented and clean but perhaps a tad smaller than we had expected. Our only complaint was it was very bright - one window had no blinds/curtains at all and those on the other windows were ineffective. It didn't overly bother us but as soon as the sun was up the place was full of light. Otherwise the studio did us nicely. The area nearby is fantastic - would be a great place to live. There's a metro stop nearby and it takes around 20 minutes to reach the city centre. Free parking on the street was ideal. Kristina provided a map of the local area which was ideal for finding our way to and from the shops etc. as we were too far out to be covered by our guidebook. Overall a very positive experience."
1071235,17514065,2014-08-13,6133935,Anca,"The studio was located near subway station in a very calm neighborhood!

Kristina welcomed us at a convenient time to welcome us to the apartment and orient us to the neighborhood.  The apartment is convenient to the restaurants, shops and sites of Jamaica Plain as well bus and subway transportation.  The apartment was attractive and clean and had amenities important for travelers and children (wifi + cable TV).

Kristina a maintenu un contact régulier avec nous jusqu'à notre arrivée où elle nous a accueillis de façon très amicale. Elle avait pris soin de nous laisser une carte du quartier avec les attraits/restos/commerces du coin, très utile pour se repérer rapidement en arrivant. Points positifs du studio : très propre, tout avait été mis à notre disposition (vaisselle, four, grille-pain, café, serviette, savon, etc.) pour que notre séjour soit des plus agréables. Nous n'avons manqué de rien! Nous avons adoré le quartier: petits restos sympas, buanderie, marché d'alimentation bio, superbe parc (avis aux joggeurs!), etc. La station de métro est à 3 min à pied, ce qui facilite l'accès au centre-ville (20 min de T environ). L'emplacement est donc idéal si vous passez la journée au centre-ville et revenez seulement le soir (le studio étant tout de même éloigné du centre-ville) ou si vous voulez explorer un coin moins touristique de Boston, mais tout aussi charmant et coloré. Jamaica Plain est un coup de cœur, particulièrement pour son esprit communautaire. Nous nous sommes sentis en sécurité. Nous pouvions d'ailleurs laisser notre voiture dans la rue gratuitement et sans problème. Nous reviendrons!"

The bathroom had a good shower,shampoo and conditioner,hair dryer,and several shelves by the sink for toiletries.  There were towels of various sizes and several towel racks.,,
This room was very comfortable,"cozy and quiet.  My impression was that the hosts really thought about amenities that would be appreciated by travelers.  \"",,,,
1071235,23537172,2014-12-03,1093788,Anjuli,"The studio was a great space and a great starting point from which to explore JP and Boston! It was compact, but the size was perfect for the two of us. The studio is very comfortable, and there's a full kitchen that we didn't take advantage of, but it would be great for someone staying a little more long term. Very close to the T station, Jamaica Pond, and a good variety of cafes, restaurants, and bars. We also had a rental car, and there is ample free street parking, which was really nice. Chris and Kristina were wonderful, too - we had an issue with the space heater and they were very quick and responsive. We would definitely recommend the studio to anyone traveling to Boston or Jamaica Plain."
1071235,23713024,2014-12-08,2527628,S,Super studio. Clean and cozy. Thanks for everything.
1071235,24448090,2014-12-28,15602438,Kimberly,"Hosts were warm & welcoming, yet gave us plenty of space. The studio is cozy & suited our needs. The studio is located in a lovely part of the neighborhood that's quiet (good for sleeping!) yet a very quick walk to many amenities (good for socializing/eating/seeing the town)."
1071235,25214034,2015-01-09,9425152,Jane,"The studio was a fantastic place to stay on my recent trip to Boston. It's clean, cozy, and private, exactly what I was looking for. Public transportation is very accessible so getting around town was a breeze. I would stay at Kristina and Chris's again in a heartbeat."
1071235,25536409,2015-01-19,20951281,Betania,"We enjoyed the studio, it is well located, confortablem, spacious and beautiful. We strongly recomend it. It was a wonderfull experience and a lovely trip. Chirs and Kristina were very kind and if we have the oportunity to travel again to Boston we will certaintly apply again, Betania and Joana"

1071235,27620945,2015-03-08,6416389,Scott,Chris and Kristina's flat in the back of their house is cozy and colorful. It is in a beautiful residential section of Boston close to the T and stores and restaurants in several directions. The studio provides great seclusion from the outside world if desired while being walkable to so much. Staying at their place was perfect for my first experience of Jamaica Plain.
1071235,28023595,2015-03-16,27382742,Nadya,"This was our first experience using airbnb and we will certainly continue to do so if all experiences are as good as this one! From the first email, welcoming us to her home, through the text messages during our stay, Kristina was warm and welcoming and personable. Unfortunately, our schedules didn't align, and we never met in person. We found a key and map waiting for us, and entered the adorable studio through a private entrance on the side of their home. Everything was there, as advertised - plenty of space for two, a large and well equipped bathroom, comfortable bed and more than adequate kitchen space. We would just recommend a step stool in the kitchen - we are short and the shelves with cups and plates were difficult to reach :-)"
The neighborhood was quiet. We felt perfectly safe walking late at night between our studio and our son's home just a few blocks away. This was the most appealing reason for staying at this location. Now that we've been there,we will certainly return. Thank you,"Kristina!\"",,,
1071235,28773120,2015-03-30,12208208,Caroline,Basic little studio flat.... not far from the station either.  We parked easily outside as well.   Ideal for a couple of nights.
1071235,29256982,2015-04-06,8429711,Rachael,"Chris and Kristina's spot was the perfect place to stay.  It was clean, just the right size, and the bathroom was very very nice and clean.  It's also in a great location in Jamaica Plain- close to the train, coffee, and restaurants.  I would definitely stay there again."
1071235,30026700,2015-04-16,9425152,Jane,"This was my second time staying in Chris & Kristina's studio, and it was just as cozy and convenient as I remember. The location is just perfect, minutes away from restaurants, grocery stores, and everything JP has to offer. Very convenient to public transport to get downtown. Kristina stocked the kitchen with delicious local coffee, which was a lovely extra touch!"
1071235,30373409,2015-04-21,19538171,Erica,We were here for Marathon Monday. This was a great little studio in a quiet area outside Boston and only a few blocks from the T with access to anywhere.
1071235,30573462,2015-04-24,24499141,Tricia,"We had a great stay at this cozy studio apartment. We were staying during the work week, and we didn't meet Chris and Kristina in person, but they were always available to answer questions. The apartment kitchen had everything we needed cook simple meals. We loved that the apartment was just a quick walk to the T, coffee shops and restaurants (and our daughter appreciated the nearby playgrounds!). We parked our car on the street when we arrived and didn't need it again until we left. Definitely recommend!"
1071235,30716194,2015-04-26,13137292,Zel,The place was great! Perfect for what I was looking for :)
1071235,32053989,2015-05-13,28794038,Lorraine,"I visited Boston for an extended work trip at the end April/early May and stayed at this fabulous little studio in JP.   Prior to arrival I had plenty of information about both the area and settling in.  The studio is situated in a lovely neighbourhood and suited me perfectly - I really felt as though I had a safe and friendly place to come home to after long days in the office.  The studio is very well equipped and comfortable and in easy reach of local transport and shops. Throughout my stay, Kristina was extremely helpful and quick to respond to any query.   All in all, it was a perfect accommodation experience for me - and I'm grateful that my first airbnb experience involved such excellent hosts and a lovely environment!  Highly recommended - and I'm hoping to stay there again in the future!"
1071235,32504157,2015-05-19,12433770,Amanda,"My parents stayed at Chris and Kristina's -- it was their first AirBnB experience and it couldn't have been more perfect! Chris and Kristina are the perfect hosts: unflaggingly kind and welcoming, they were wonderfully communicative, checking in to see if they needed anything. The space itself is lovely, as well; it is clean and cozy and in a perfect location. All in all, I cannot praise the hosts enough!"
1071235,32973474,2015-05-24,7821794,Ashley,"Came for a weekend getaway. Kristina was friendly and welcoming. She arranged an early check in for us and gave some great suggestions for seafood. The studio is the perfect size, has all the amenities you need for a great stay and is in an awesome location. Close to the subway, gorgeous neighborhood, within walking distance to several restaurants and parks. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
1071235,33478358,2015-05-28,24917220,Laurel,"Great location, comfortable sudio and really nice, responsive hosts!  Everything you need in a really fun neighborhood.  Wonderful coffee in the room too!"
1071235,34128708,2015-06-05,7083166,Amy,"Good communication and very friendly welcome.  We were confused when we arrived because the entry in the pics is not the entry to the studio.  Kristina was there in a flash to sort us out and let us in.  That kind of personal service is what distinguishes a good AirBnB experience, IMO."
Place was immaculate.  That means a lot to me!  Some of the furnishings were a bit funky but everything was serviceable.  Bathroom is huge with great storage,lots of hot water and plenty of water pressure.  The bed is comfy but the bedding was less so.,,,,
We were in town for a hospital stay,so we didn't get to see much,but JP looks really wonderful.  The local architecture is worth returning for and the reviews for area restaurants seem to indicate JP is a diner's mecca.  So sorry I was eating hospital food!,,,
Parking was never a problem even though when you first drive into the area,it's hard to imagine how you'll find a place -- just very dense!  My husband was always a bit nervous about getting a spot after returning from the hospital late at night,but he found one  every single time.  The trick for us was to navigate beyond the street the house is on and find our way to a one-way street that comes down along the studio.  This allowed him to essentially park right across the street every time.  The neighborhood feels very safe and we weren't worried about leaving stuff in the back of the car.,,,
We hit a cold snap and had to use the space heater.  It worked quite well.  I'd be concerned about being the person on the right side of the bed,with the A/C right next to me,during the summer.  Only other concern is that the place does not get fully dark (streetlights and morning sun) so if that's an issue for you,bring an eye shade.  Worked for me.  Noise level was minimal from the neighborhood.  If guests are staying upstairs,that could be a different story,depending on their consideration.
Bottom line: Great if funky place,lovely hosts,cool neighborhood,"good price.  Would definitely recommend to those looking for value and personality.  \"",,
1071235,34621141,2015-06-10,27362059,Emmie,Kristina and Chris were wonderful hosts. Their studio apartment was clean and quiet and had everything we needed for our brief time there. They made themselves available to answer questions. They were even flexible on our check out time when our plans had to change due to outside circumstances. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in town. Jamaica Plain is a wonderful historic and safe neighborhood.
1071235,34956866,2015-06-14,5816567,Eileen,Kristina was very welcoming and let us check in early. The studio was just as described in a great neighborhood that was really close to the subway and some great restaurants as well.

Kristina and Chris were very quick to respond and great about staying in touch in case we needed anything after a late check-in. Their place is just as described, a very cute studio with its own private entrance and a super comfy bed. The location was superb near the Stony Brook T stop and a very quick ride to all of the attractions downtown."
1071235,37795300,2015-07-10,37091532,Cabral,"Chris & Kristina were there to greet me when I arrived and were great hosts throughout. The studio was colorful, clean, and neat, and had all the promised amenities. I enjoyed my stay and loved being in such a central location in JP."

Les instructions etaient claires et le studio correspondait aux photos du site.  Très près de la station de métro et quartier paisible et sécuritaire.  Très pratique si vous avez une auto, le stationnement dans les rues est permis."
1071235,42844323,2015-08-16,19869204,Kristen,It was great staying in Kristina's bachelor apartment in JP!  She was always easily available when needed.  Everything was as described and it was a great place to stay nearby Boston with easy subway access.

It was clean, the bed was very comfortable, and it was overall a great place to stay. I was greeted by the host and they were available to answer any questions. The neighborhood was lovely and just a quick walk to the T.  I would definitely choose to stay here again. Thank you!"
1071235,44989786,2015-08-30,41626974,Vince,"Kristina came out and greeted us warmly when we arrived at the house.  Although the address is on Spring Park Ave., the entrance to the studio is around the corner on Rockview St., with a private entrance.  There were always plenty of parking spaces available on the street within a block of the studio.  The studio is in an old building which has been fully renovated, with a fully-equipped kitchen, bath, breakfast nook and bedroom. It is decorated with some very tasteful art and has all the amenities you'd expect, plus a few extras, like a large stack of DVD's.  It's right in the center of Jamaica Plains, but on a very quiet side street.  We were never disturbed by noise, and barely were aware that there were people living right next to us."
There was very little to complain about.  The outside flood light was not working,so we had to leave the vestibule light on when we went out.  It would have been nice if there had been a night light in the bathroom.  Other than that,everything was great.,,,
The house is about 1/4 mile walk from Centre Street,the main drag in JP,and a short walk from there to several nice restaurants.  We didn't try walking around very late,but the area seems pretty safe.,,
All in all,we really enjoyed our stay,"and would definitely stay there again the next time we're in the area.\"",,,
1071235,45884039,2015-09-06,42803722,Diana,"This studio was perfect! Just the right size for what we needed it for, a place to crash after long days of exploring Boston. Kristina and Kris were very accommodating and left the studio key, with a map of the property, as well as a list of sites in the city in the front mailbox. Everything in the apartment was clean and neat. We also were given complimentary soap and shampoo. Great experience! Would definitely rent from them again."
1071235,46276932,2015-09-09,18282582,Kristen,"Place was great! Appreciated the suggestions of places to eat and go to in the neighborhood.  Place was comfortable, table to eat at, kitchen if you chose to cook.  Chris and Kristina let us have our privacy.  Was a perfect place to stay."

1071235,48274041,2015-09-25,37309529,Laura,"Despite us running late due to traffic congestion, Kristina was able to meet us at the studio when we arrived. It was great to see her in person and receive all the info about the studio, although it definitely would not have been a problem if we had to fend for ourselves. Kristina and Chris provided excellent written info about the Jamaica Plain neighbourhood and Boston. The studio itself was clean and tidy and included all amenities we needed. We had privacy and always felt safe in the neighbourhood. It was a bonus how easy it was to walk to the Sam Adams brewery (free tour!) and it was a quick and direct train trip to the City, Fenway, the airport, etc. Stony Brook station is a great location. Overall we were very pleased with the studio and hospitality, and would definitely stay again if we travelled to the Boston area."
1071235,48515660,2015-09-27,33706354,Darren,This was a great place to stay. Very easy to get into Boston on the subway and in a nice location with plenty of parking. The studio itself was a good size and had exactly what I needed. I was only able to meet Chris and kristina once but they provided very good instructions and responded almost immediately to any emails.
1071235,49320793,2015-10-03,20172808,Laurie,"We loved the area!  The studio had everything in it you would need, even umbrellas, which were a life saver!  Kristina's recommendations were perfect!  It was so convenient to get to the T train, which got you to anywhere you wanted to go. She even accommodated an early check in so we could get rid of our luggage! I would recommend staying here!"
1071235,49859665,2015-10-06,31086763,Christine,"The studio was nice and cosy, everything in it what you need. The kitchen is small but it is no problem to cook a proper meal and there is a table, perfect for a dinner for two. Kristina is a very friendly host and made us feel being at home. It's about a ten minute walk to the subway and from there only 20 min to downtown Boston. The quarter where the studio is located is also nice, a whole food market nearby and many different places to eat. If we come to Boston again I would try to stay here again."
1071235,50179576,2015-10-10,3245331,David,"This is a great place to stay: comfortable, clean, tidy, fantastic location and kind hosts."
We arrived late,tired and hungry after a long haul flight from Australia and were met by Kristina who kindly sorted us out with dinner and a drink.   The location is fantastic,a quick walk to the train,lovely streets and parks to stroll around and plenty of great places to eat.  The studio is comfortable and easily accommodated us and our baby (plus additional baby things).  Street parking is easily available and free.,,
The studio is private with its own separate entrance so you never feel like you are imposing on the family’s home.  Kristina is a great host – friendly,readily available and willing to assist (she quickly sorted out the internet after the suburb lost power).,,,,
I would recommend this place to friends and family.,,,,,

The apartment was about 10 minutes walk to the metro station n within 25 to 30mins to downtown Boston. Free parking is available along the street n the Neighbourhood was safe. Kitchen was just sufficient for two of us n well equipped. Would definitely recommend."
1071235,57055935,2015-12-21,6999452,Youkang,"This studio is well located in 5 minutes short walking distance to the Stony Brook T. It is in a very quiet neighborhood. The kitchen is well equipped with stove, microwave and a very small refrigerator."
The unit is much smaller than what the picture depicted. There is barely room for one person to move around in the living space. Even that has to be negotiated with your luggage space. There is really not enough room for two to sit down at the small table to eat at all and we did not. The kitchen sink had a drainage problem and was flooded,"it was not resolved for more than a week. We had to request toilet paper twice because we were provided only with 2 rolls of toilet paper initially. We think this unit is very suitable for one person and for short stay!\"",,,,

While there isn't much happening in the neighborhood, being so close the the subway was a major plus. Cute houses in the area, a nice craft beer store, organic market and a diner were great touches to this cute JP neighborhood. And the benefit of having the Sam Adams brewery in walking distance was a fun addition! The private entrance to the studio was great and the size was perfect. Having a small kitchen, breakfast nook, large bathroom and bedroom made the trip easy and comfortable! Thank you, Kristina and Chris!"

It was very clean and comfortable (bed is very comfortable) and although it's a small apartment, it felt spacious.  Although I didn't use it much, the kitchen was very well equipped. The apartment gets nice light in the daytime.  The neighborhood is very nice, quiet, and fun to walk around.  I had great coffee and pastries at the nearby City Feed and Supply.

Chris & Kristina were very accommodating and happy to answer any questions we had in order to make our stay as enjoyable as possible.

1071235,71011251,2016-04-22,47793053,Stephanie,"We greatly enjoyed the studio in Jamaica Plain. It was clean and cheerful, just steps away from lots of restaurants and shops. Kristina  was very welcoming and gave us lots of information about the area. The bed was firm and wonderful.  This was our first time at an Airbnb so we did not know what to expect. The studio was small but we felt comfortable and we especially loved not having to drive to go out to eat, etc. Highly recommended."
1071235,71423460,2016-04-25,17832920,Anna,We really enjoyed staying here. It was warm and cozy and the location was great and convenient! It was a short walk to the train station and to Samuel Adams Brewery! We went to the brewery twice since it was so close. Love that they provided a map of the surrounding restaurants and attractions. It was very helpful when trying to find a place to eat. Would definitely stay here again for our next Boston trip!
1071235,72265357,2016-05-01,390734,Sarah,"I reserved Chris and Kristina's place for my in-laws who were visiting for the weekend and they had a wonderful stay.  The hosts were extremely communicative leading up to the visit and made the arrival/departure process very simple.  Their place is great and I'd highly recommend it to other visitors to the Boston area.  In particular, it was perfect for visiting family members (as we live in the same neighborhood) and we will definitely utilize the space again!"
1071235,73077581,2016-05-06,22067740,Tom,"The hosts made me feel welcome with their communications prior to my arrival.  The space was as listed, perfect for one or two people.  The neighborhood was classic Jamaica Plain and close to restaurants and public transportation.  Street parking was tight."
1071235,73773574,2016-05-10,17150752,Donna,"Chris & Kristina's Cozy JP Studio is clean, comfy, and conveniently located to everything we needed. Although there's no such thing as 1000%...if there was...I would recommend this cozy studio 1000%"
1071235,74891438,2016-05-17,7902858,Mark,Everything was as expected.  Chris & Kristina communicated with us at every step so there were no problems checking in or out.  Very quiet neighborhood and easy access to the center of the city.  The apartment was clean and quiet with easy access and set off the street.  Would definitely consider staying again.
1071235,78612062,2016-06-07,1695789,Wendy,"The accommodations were exactly as listed.  It was tasteful, clean, comfortable and completely functional.  It met all the needs of our stay.  Our hosts were welcoming and completely responsive to our needs."
1071235,79881537,2016-06-14,63744062,Mike,"Our experience at Chris and Kristina's studio was excellent!  Initial correspondence was via email and text message. We arrived after dark and the family was to be out with kid's activities, so the key was left in the mailbox with greetings and instructions.  We found the studio to be exactly as advertised, and we were provided with maps and typed notes regarding local restaurants, transportation, etc. The studio was clean and neat, very comfortable, with amenities as advertised. The neighborhood was quiet and very pretty.  Restaurants nearby ranged from EXCELLENT to average.  Walking to the MBTA station was a breeze, a good morning wake-up (.3mi), and the subway system was outstanding for seeing the city and the special attractions of our choice (mostly food spots!)  We had very pleasant conversations with Kristina on two occasions, and met her very nice sons.  She was accessible but not there unless we asked her to be.  When I texted with questions I got prompt responses and the right information.  The neighborhood, and their house, is historic - meaning the homes are old.  The studio is not brand new, elements are old but others were added when the room was converted to a studio.  I say these things so that nobody comes here expecting a brand new Hyatt room!  This is a well kept remodeled studio in an old home, and we found that to be a great part of our travel experience. Bottom line - I would highly recommend this studio to anyone looking to stay in the Boston area!"
1071235,80338206,2016-06-17,5219596,Claire,"My parents really enjoyed staying at Kristina and Chris's place during their visit to JP. The location was perfect, as the apartment is within easy walking distance to all the attractions on Centre Street as well as Jamaica Pond. The studio was perfect for two people, and it was great to have a fully equipped kitchen to use during the stay. Kristina and Chris were lovely hosts, with excellent communication and fast response time before and during their stay. They went out of their way to make my parents feel welcome - Kristina even offered to give my mom a pot of beautiful yellow poppies to take home to her own garden! I'd highly recommend this AirBnB and my parents would definitely stay here again."
1071235,81186743,2016-06-21,8348954,Jigbie,Our family was in town for a wedding and day trips to the beach.  We had a great stay here.  Kristina and Chris were around to greet us when we arrived and made sure to check that we had everything we needed.  Parking was easy and we spent a good amount of time going around the JP area.

1071235,83569068,2016-07-03,31042934,Alex,"This place was a perfect accommodation in a fantastic neighborhood. Four blocks from a T stop, very comfortable studio, anything that we would need. We arrived two hours earlier than expected, and they were gracious in letting us drop off our stuff so we could get to Fenway for a ballgame, even before they were done cleaning. High recommendation, fun people to work with. Hope to get their place next time we're in Boston."
1071235,84233312,2016-07-06,202218,Peggy,"Chris and Kristina have a great spot in the area.  The studio is quiet, comfortable, spacious and clean and has a great personality. It gets a lot of light in the morning - very bright and cheery. The location is a nice residential street, parking is free and available, and it's very convenient to the train.  We had a late arrival but they made sure we had instructions and knew how to get access."
1071235,85866783,2016-07-13,70269221,Leigh,"Our stay in Chris & Kristina's private studio in Jamaica Plain was very comfortable and met all our desires and needs! We hope to stay here again. Hosts were always accessible if we needed them; Queen bed was comfortable; apartment was clean and little kitchen was fully equipped and more than we needed! Great first experience with Airbnb! Thank you, Chris and Kristima!"
1071235,89219796,2016-07-27,78529723,Jane,"This was our first stay at an airbnb and we weren't sure what to expect, however it exceeded our expectations! The space is cozy and very clean - perfect for 2 people! Chris and Kristina left nice touches, such as maps and guides around Jamaica Plain and Boston. It was conveniently located near the subway with a great coffee shop along the way. Neighbourhood is safe and quiet.  We visited Boston on one of the hottest days this summer and the a/c cooled the space quickly. On top of that, the bed was super comfortable! There was a lot of street parking, in fact we were able to find a spot right across the street from the place. Definitely would go back and would recommend it as a place to stay if you're going to Boston."
1071235,96543615,2016-08-23,74883826,Lynn,"Chris and Kristina went out of their way to send helpful info like how to get to their place from the airport and reminders as I approached my visit date. Location was great - so easy to navigate JP and go downtown via bus or train. Their place was absolutely lovely - it had an Ikea inspired, summer cottage feel that was really adorable. Bed was super comfy. I wanted for nothing except to stay forever!"
4339392,23449831,2014-12-01,7341005,Susanna,"Kyle and Sefira's place in Jamaica Plains was as described in their Airbnb entry: spacious, comfortable, and chic.  We were able to host a small Thanksgiving get together for our children, who attend college in Boston.  A short walk to the Orange line, makes this place very accessible to downtown Boston. There are great grocery stores close by and also some nice eateries."
"Coordination for access was seamless and they were always available to answer any questions. This is the best rental we have had via Airbnb. \"",,,,,

4339392,70690972,2016-04-19,28652701,Daniel,"Kyle, Sefira, and Frida (their cat) were great hosts. The place was clean and very well kept. The MBTA station is a 5 minute walk from the house and downtown JP is less than a 10 minute walk making it very easy to explore! I traveled with my wife and mom and both of them were very impressed with the place and the neighborhood too! Nothing bad to say about our experience!"
4339392,77378718,2016-05-31,26195103,Ashley,"Kyle and Sefira's apartment was a beautiful spot to start and end our days in Boston.   Convenient to the T, walking distance to some great restaurants in JP, the pond, and in a great neighborhood, it made our stay easy and enjoyable.  The layout of the apartment is spacious and had a great layout for our family of three. The area is quiet and the neighbors were lovely.  If you are trying to decide bw staying here or somewhere else  while you are in Boston/JP, this place is definitely ideal."
4339392,78114284,2016-06-05,61722500,Olive,Kyle and Sefira's house is absolutely amazing! It's so pretty and spacious. Their cat Frida is so cute and so friendly. Me and my family really enjoyed our stay in Boston. It's also very close to the orange line so it can't be even better! Strongly recommend this place!
4339392,81156504,2016-06-21,50108760,Chrissy,"Two adults and one teenager travelled to Boston for a long weekend. Pointed in the direction of Jamaica Plain by friends who live nearby. The neighborhood is safe and friendly. Lucky to have stayed at Kyle and Sefira's home. Plenty of room for all of us. Comfortable, well-appointed and well-maintained living space, inside and out. All the conveniences of home. Short walk to public transportation, stores and restaurants ( we did not have a rental car). 10 minute subway ride to Boston. Kyle and Sefira are generous hosts and made every attempt to assist us before and during our stay. Their cat Frida is friendly and not a bother at all. In a nutshell: Southern hospitality in the northeast. Would definitely stay here again. Many thanks for opening your home to us!"
4339392,91461998,2016-08-05,31542506,Cathal,We had a great stay at Kyle & Sefira's beautiful apartment! We use to live just down the street and thoroughly enjoyed being back in our old neighborhood.

6614984,43132378,2015-08-17,39956565,Cindy,Paul is a super nice person. His place is clean and trendy. Very inviting. I loved that he had air conditioning as the temps outside were 90 degrees during my visit. The area surrounding his apartment appears older and some places are rundown. Yet Paul's place is up to date and I felt quite safe.
6614984,43649954,2015-08-21,38602690,Kat,"Our stay at Paul's was fantastic. He was traveling during our visit and went above and beyond to answer all of our questions and provided some tips on travel around the area. His place is very clean and inviting, and in a great location. Great experience!"

In addition,Paul is one of the most responsible person I have ever seen. He made me start to deeply understand the meaning of trust. Besides,he is very kind and lenient because I made a mistake about the time of check in,and he forgives my mistake when I explain the mistake. I think you will enjoy the conversation with Paul. And next time to Boston,"I will choose Paul's apartment without any doubt.\"",

6614984,56741099,2015-12-17,42786814,Aislinn,"We didn't get to meet Paul, but he was always just a text message away. The apartment couldn't have been more perfect. It was an easy walk to the T, and the apartment itself is easily accessible from I90. A parallel road one block away has free, all day parking without a permit and the parking in front of the apartment was perfect for loading and unloading (2 hour parking without a permit). The apartment is extremely cozy and my friend said she got the best sleep she's had in a while. I will definitely try to rent from Paul again!"

6614984,58052028,2015-12-31,33696448,Stephen,Paul is the rockstar of AIRBNB hosts. His beautiful loft in East Boston provided a perfect location for the Laker Celtics game while also being centrally located so we could maneuver around the city of Boston easily.

The one downside was that the place to pick up the key was about 6 blocks away and was kind of a hassle to get to. It was raining one day we checked out and it was quite an inconvenience to walk 6 blocks in the rain. Other than that, it was a great place"

4402259,23974147,2014-12-15,18501293,Hai,Caitlyn was a wonderful host! We arrived very late but she went out of her way to make arrangement to give us the keys to access her cozy apartment. It was everything that we hoped for. She also had breakfast for us in the fridge and constantly communicated to make sure that we had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend her place for any solo traveler or a couple.
4402259,25890143,2015-01-28,24839974,Chris,"\"Stayed in Caitlyn's apartment through the \"\"historic\"\" blizzard of January 2015.  Caitlyn is very friendly and did her best to answer my questions and was available by phone"
The apartment itself is warm,cozy,and comfortable,and I had a great time waiting out the storm.  There's a private patio,and I got to watch as the snow built up and eventually buried the entire patio table!,
The location is superb.  Just minutes walk from Bunker Hill,and a pleasant 20-30 minute walk to downtown Boston.  I highly recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to take it easy in Boston for a few days or longer.,,,,
My reservation ended right in the middle of the storm,and Caitlyn called and offered to let me stay in the apartment for an extra day or two completely free of charge.  I ended up moving to the hotel anyway in order to meet up with my colleagues (was in town for a business trip),"but it was a very gracious gesture!\"",,,

She also left a long note with clear instructions and that made us feel very welcomed. We couldn't use the patio because of snow but it looked beautiful! The apartment itself is warm, very clean and cozy. The bed and the couch is very comfortable. We also had all the essentials we needed. The kitchen was very useful as well. She also left some breakfast for us. We didnt go out much so I don't know the neighborhood but I'm pretty sure it would be even better if it wasnt -30 outside. Even at this time,We could walk to places such as CVS   Whole Foods which was also very convenient."

4402259,28123999,2015-03-18,26727170,Dave,"Had a great time in Caitlyn's apartment. Lovely room, very comfy bed and she was kind enough to leave us some food and shower products. All the info we needed was there on arrival. Very nicely located also, a short walk to the subway and only three stops to State Street. Would definitely stay again."
4402259,28477179,2015-03-24,21166438,Victoria,"We had a good stay at Caitlyn's place. Caitlyn was very flexible which made the check in really easy for us, and we received a really warm welcome - Caitlyn was kind enough to leave us with lots of breakfast supplies and toiletries."
The apartment itself is perfect for two people -and the bed is the most comfortable bed ever.,,,,,
Location wise,"we thought it was great - lots of shops and a couple of great pubs in Charlestown on and just a 10 min walk to the metro (about a 20 min walk to North End). \"",,,,
4402259,29269786,2015-04-06,24203353,Caitlin,"Beautiful studio apartment! Perfect location! Very close to bunker hill monument and USS Constitution....very close to public transportation! Caitlyn was a great host! She provides some breakfast foods, coffee, and toiletries. My husband and I had a great time! Highly recommend! :-)"
4402259,29826686,2015-04-13,27206884,David,Caitlyn left food in the fridge for us - very welcome. She gave us clear instructions to get into the apartment so it was all plain sailing even though she couldn't meet us herself as she was at work. Caitlyn was always happy to reply to our queries by text.
The apartment is in a very quiet  area,round the corner from  a few little restaurants (Thai,Chinese,pizza) and a few minutes from a great supermarket that sells a wide range of everything and is handy for cooked food if you don't feel like cooking.,,
It's only 8-10 minutes easy walk to the T station,Community College.,,,,
It's near (very walkable) to the historic bits of Charlestown (Bunker Hill,"dockyard) and is also within walking distance of the North End.\"",,,,
4402259,30541907,2015-04-24,109512,Richard,"\"Our host, Caitlyn, was amazing.  Her place was exactly how it was pictured.  It was so bright and cheerful.  The kitchen, bathroom and everything was very clean and cozy.  We were surprised at how bright and sunny the unit was and how much we enjoyed the back patio. The fact that it is on the first floor (no lugging of suitcases up a staircase) and that there was free laundry right downstairs really put this unit above the rest.   She even stocked the frig with our favorite things.  Her place is really close to the T, restaurants, cute shops and Whole Foods/CVS.  We were thrilled to be able to walk to many historical sites such as Bunker Hill Monument and the USS Constitution.  We even caught our \"\"Super Duck Tour\"\" right there as well.  We would highly recommend Caitlyn's place to anyone traveling in Boston.  \""
4402259,31422813,2015-05-05,24198622,Marlies,"There were some bagels, cream cheese, coffee and other stuff when we arrived, that made us feel welcome. We didn't meet Caitlyn, but if I we had a question she was very quick to respond via text! It felt like she was really close."
We loved the apartment. It's spacious and clean. We liked the neighbourhood,"safe and quiet.\"",,,,
4402259,32496005,2015-05-19,8977254,Michelle,"Very comfortable and relaxing.  The place is nicely updated and modern. Caitlyn does live here, so there were some of her personal items around but everything was clean and organized so we didn't even notice! Our hostess left us some lovely things for breakfast, some we requested and some she generously put on her own. There is a Keurig machine. The location is great--it's a quieter area and feels very safe. It's a very close walk to the Community College T-station and then a quick walk into town. There is parking but check with Caitlyn about some of the rules."
Probably the most comfortable bed I have slept on in a very long time and I caught up on some much needed sleep.  The pull-out couch was also quite comfy. The shower head was also amazing! If I ever needed a place again to stay in Boston,"I would definitely consider there.  \"",,,,
4402259,33900199,2015-06-02,26706793,Cristy,"Caitlyn's place was absolutely perfect for our trip!  The apartment has more than enough space for two people and it was absolutely spotless!  She left a note for us with basic information about the apartment and the area and some food for breakfast as well.  The apartment is just a short walk to the T and you can be in North Boston in just 20 minutes. Her Charleston neighborhood is quiet and very beautiful! Additionally, Caitlyn was quick to respond to messages and always very helpful.  I would highly recommend her!"
4402259,34112808,2015-06-04,11622025,Jessica,The host canceled this reservation 51 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4402259,34774776,2015-06-12,30580202,Martha,"My husband and I stayed at Caitlyn's place and while she was not there to greet us she left us plenty of information to access her building as well as information on her neighborhood. We didn't require to see her in person, she did come in to take out the trash on trash day so she let us know ahead of time. Her place is very cute a wonderful clean space and very open for a studio. The patio looked great and the neighbors were all very quiet. She left us food, space for our clothes and items in the bathroom we could use which is so much better than a hotel would ever do! We will recommend Caitlyn's place to anyone we know that makes it to Boston in the near future."
4402259,36089325,2015-06-25,4689046,Abigail,The house was nice. A little further from Boston than we originally thought but we were able to bring a car so it worked out. There are spots for meters a few blocks away.
4402259,38609539,2015-07-17,34688475,Jnana,"Our stay was enjoyable.  We were able to easily check in and get settled.  Everything was just as expected.  We used the fold out couch in addition to the bed; worked well.  House is located in a cute neighborhood.  We ate at the Grasshopper Cafe twice which was nice and close to the house.  We also walked to the Bunker Hill Monument.  In addition, we were nice and close to Whole Foods and the Bunker Hill Community College T line where we could catch the orange line.  We were able to easily get up and out for the day and home easily even at 10:00 at night.  The neighborhood felt safe.  Great price for the rental and certainly beat a hotel!"
4402259,39012834,2015-07-20,33526067,Antoine,"Super nice place, she was very interactive! Even when I needed an iron she responded quickly and was nice about it. It cost us about 6 bucks to uber or lyft to downtown or you could take the freedom trail which will take you two miles right into the heart of the city!"
4402259,44750046,2015-08-29,28347638,Llyw,"I stayed here with my girlfriend and we found the whole neighborhood really picturesque and very peaceful. Caitlyn made us feel welcome immediately, leaving us some provisions in the fridge and the bathroom and also gave us clear instructions on where to go, how to get about etc. She was also easily contactable and willing to help at short notice with any issues."
The apartment itself is great and really well set up,clean and tidy. We spent every day out and about but we also enjoyed our nights in in front of the tv. Unfortunately due to the weather,we never got to make the most of the patio. The apartment is in a great location,close to all the transport links to downtown and a 5 minute walk to the Bunker Hill monument. Occasionally we heard the other tenant in the building coming or going,but it was never disruptive.,
I'd recommend to anyone to stay here,for us it made all the difference to our stay in this excellent city.,,,,
Great location,great price,"great bagels. I ate all the bagels.\"",,,
4402259,46117588,2015-09-08,31732034,Sonja,Caitlyn was great at getting in touch when we needed her!
Her studio home was beautiful and comfy :),,,,,
The bed and shower were perfect!,,,,,
Close to some lovely restaurants,"cafes and a 2 minute walk to the bus stop which took you directly into Boston!\"",,,,
4402259,49968553,2015-10-08,16128206,Erik,"We had two lovely nights at Caitlyns place. It is very well located in a quiet street in picturesque Charlestown, Boston. Close to shops/restaurants and at ten minutes (walking) to the T-line into the city. The apartment is good for two people and because we had it for ourselves it felt like we lived in the city. It has everything from a kitchen, big tv and wifi. We had very nice weather and it is great to have a spacious patio! Caitlyn communicated great. She told us how to check-in and left a note about the house. We would definitely recommend staying here for your trip to Boston!"
4402259,50441540,2015-10-12,28517358,Jessica,Lovely apartment in a nice quiet location. The bed was super comfy it made it hard to get up and visit Boston!!! Travel links were good and the uber into town was cheap. There were a number of nice restaurants near by and all the amenities required. Great to have some outside space at the apartment too. Caitlyn left some provisions in the fridge which was a very nice extra benefit. Would highly recommend for those visiting the area
4402259,51289414,2015-10-19,42317963,Stephen,This place was pretty great. The location is amazing and the place was perfect for my girlfriend and me. Caitlyn is a good host and took care of us. When we come back to Boston I'm going to look this place up agian.
4402259,51544764,2015-10-21,31244277,Gary,Excellent experience.  Nice set-up in the heart of Charlestown with convenience access to local landmarks and public transit.  Good combination of character and functionality for the apartment.  Considerate and flexible host.  This is where I'm going to try and stay when I'm in Boston.
4402259,68465113,2016-04-05,22095653,John,Caitlyn's home was in an awesome location which allowed great accessibility to everywhere we planned on going. Our Uber's cost between 6-10 dollars for a trip downtown. The home was inviting and the use of the patio was a great perk.
4402259,70598978,2016-04-18,15639048,Lindsey,"The apartment was exactly as described and easy to get to. Everything about our trip was smooth and even though we didn't meet Caitlyn, she left us breakfast items and recommendations for restaurants which were really helpful."
"This was a great choice for Boston Marathon weekend!\"",,,,,
4402259,71390646,2016-04-25,64957950,Eric,Caitlyn was so helpful with tips and ideas for visiting. She provided everything to make us feel welcome and was very quick to respond to any questions I had. Great location by the T (public transportation) and bunker hill. Definitely recommend to anybody visiting!
4402259,71582386,2016-04-26,4638035,Chris,Nice neighbourhood. Cheap uber trips to downtown Boston. The place was clean and well kept. Warm on a cold day and Caitlyn was very helpful.  Highly recommended. Thanks Caitlyn.
4402259,74816381,2016-05-16,25965291,Katie,"This studio in Charlestown was very quaint and had everything we needed. It was walking distance to the start of the Freedom Trail and the Bunker Hill Monument. Also, near stores to get supplies and restaurants. Caitlyn was very accommodating and answered all of our questions quickly.  My only negative feedback is that the place could use a really good spring cleaning."
4402259,75850709,2016-05-23,23122319,Jennifer,Caitlyn's place was great! The neighborhood was so cute and very safe. Her bed was the most comfortable thing I've ever slept in. She provided some breakfast items which was super thoughtful! Charlestown itself doesn't have a lot in one central area but it is near Bunker Hill and the USS Constitution on the pier. It was super easy to get an Uber and get around. I would definitely stay here again!
4402259,79843197,2016-06-14,65469730,Ann,"Everything was on order when Caitlyn said it would be.  The location is great for walking to  Zume's coffee house, Paulo's restaurant, and Whole Foods.  Short walk to the T-stop for the subway takes you to all parts of Boston."
Great location and charming décor,"only sorry it was too cool that weekend to use the patio.\"",,,,
4402259,81030074,2016-06-20,62940329,Jenna,Although it was a little hard to find at first- Caitlyn was super helpful in helping me find the apartment.  It was a perfect weekend in Boston and I was able to relax on the patio after a successful day of sightseeing and going to Fenway.  Charlestown is the coolest part of the city I have stayed in with restaurants and bars and quick access to the waterfront. I had an amazing experience and would love to stay here again!
4402259,94520526,2016-08-16,74412791,Karine,"Caitlyn was very accommodating and answered our questions very quickly. The flat is really cosy and convenient. The patio is great : I like the lights ! As for me and my friend, we don't think it's far from the subway station. Charlestown is nice and quiet. The USS constitution ship is worth a visit.  We had the air con : not included in the description. It seems caitlyn has a pet."
4402259,97598537,2016-08-28,72384922,Barbara,"This is a great location, but we were not comfortable living in such a personalized space."
6268805,33179209,2015-05-25,6867859,Eric,Amazing Spot! super nice hosts! a 7 dollar uber into the city

"Like this we could spend great weekend in Boston going out in the evenings and having fun. The Restaurant suggestions as well as the \"\"Boston-to-do-list\"\" were a good help.",,,,,
"Thanks again for hosting us!\"",,,,,
6268805,35108464,2015-06-15,1272173,Kristen,Justin & Heidi were perfect hosts! They sent detailed directions prior to check-in so everything went smoothly. Their place is great and in a fantastic location- especially loved the roofdeck!
6268805,38164201,2015-07-13,25666702,Michael,Justin and Heidi's place was the perfect experience. We had everything we could need and loved the roof deck. We walked everywhere and loved the Charlestown neighborhood. Will definitely look to stay here again when we return
6268805,38720647,2015-07-18,34044425,Sam,"Justin and Heidi were very accommodating and helpful throughout our trip. Charlestown and Boston exceeded our expectations, and we cant wait to return."
6268805,40016470,2015-07-27,38577810,Keith,"This was my first airbnb experience, but it certainly won't be my last.  At first, I was skeptical about staying in someone else's home, but Justin and Heidi could not have made the experience more comfortable or more enjoyable.  They were amazing hosts and went above and beyond to provide useful and helpful information that made our experience even better."
As for the apartment,it was warm and colorful,and was a much better environment than a hotel would have been.  Add in the private roof deck,and an al fresco dinner was a very enjoyable experience.,,
My experience with Justin and Heidi has certainly converted me from skeptic to future user of airbnb.  I just hope they did not set the bar too high for others by making everything so easy and comfortable.  I could not recommend staying at Justin and Heidi's any higher; it was a wonderful experience,and if we go back to Boston any time soon,"my first inquiry will definitely be whether their apartment is available again.\"",,,
6268805,40983667,2015-08-03,38704463,Kateryna,"We stayed over for 2 nights at Justin & Heidi place, and loved it. The apartment is super clean with an excellent view on the Monument right from upstairs balcony."
We were also surprised to have a basket full of different snacks and a bottle of wine upon our arrival. Moreover,since we were coming late from NYC,the key were left in the lock box just outside the apartment,so we did not have to make any inconveniences to each other in order to pick them up.,,
"Great stay!!! Highly recommended!  \"",,,,,
6268805,42447134,2015-08-13,10738646,Janice,Great host. We had a great time in the apartment. Dont miss the amazing sun rise view from the roof!

6268805,70656638,2016-04-19,44779805,Andrew,Our trip to Boston for the Marathon weekend was definitely complete having stayed in Justin and Heidi's place. Awesome location and a very quiet stay in Charlestown. Great rooftop views (especially at night) and minutes away from the whole foods and Charlestown's Main St. Walking to the North End was very easy from their place as well. Overall I would highly recommend their cozy place!! Thanks Again guys!
6268805,72247197,2016-05-01,9059472,Steve,Justin was very responsive when we called needing things. House is in a good location.  They should add a few things for food prep.
6268805,72808431,2016-05-04,4832026,Sanne,"We stayed in Justin & Heidi's apt for 2 nights. It was raining a lot during these days, so we were forced to stay in and watch tv. We felt realy at home, it's a great house to relax and read a book on the comfortable couch. The neighbourhood is also realy nice. Going into the city didn't take us a lot of time."
We didn't get to see Justin & Heidi but they responded very quick to our questions. They were very helpful.,,,,,
"We recommend this apt to anybody who needs a cozy 'home' in Boston!\"",,,,,

Accurate description of the place, helpful and timely responses and they gave me useful information about things to do and see in the surrounding area. Beautiful and clean unit! Only negative was the parking situation, other than that-fantastic 2-day experience."
6268805,73935309,2016-05-11,5280950,Kellie,"This apartment was the perfect home base for our time in Boston, situated at the end of the Freedom Trail and a 20 minute walk to the heart of the North End. We wished the weather was nicer because it made the rooftop patio quite chilly! Thanks, again!"
6268805,74185157,2016-05-13,47844192,Kenneth,Really lovely spot in a quiet neighborhood with lots of natural light and a roof deck. Hard to beat waking up to birds chirping! The hosts were very communicative leading up to and during the stay. Great experience and would stay again.
6268805,75073413,2016-05-18,25301119,Diana,"Heidi and Justin have a LOVELY place in a great part of Charlestown.  The rooftop deck was an added bonus, as it has a great view of the Bunkerhill Monument. Their apartment description was accurate, which made my mother feel very comfortable renting from H & J in the future. The hosts went out of their way to have teas, wine, towels and a comfy bed to sleep in. We would absolutely rent their condo again."
6268805,75978864,2016-05-23,3993387,Nancy,I highly recommend this listing and the communication with J&H is awesome! They provided everything we need during stay and this penthouse is in a very beautiful/safe neighborhood.

The apartment was clean (I'm very picky about this, felt 100% comfortable), snugged away on the top floor of a row house. The rooftop was a great addition. The host has a welcome bottle of wine, and toiletries. I would definitely stay here again in the future."
"Highly recommended.\"",,,,,
6268805,80122462,2016-06-16,55986396,Lindsay,"We loved staying at Justin and Heidi's!  It was a perfect location - near Monument Square and a short walk to North Station, the North End, Downtown, and Cambridge.  The apartment was bright and well-decorated with a stocked kitchen.  It was clean and quiet, and the roof deck is an added perk!  Justin and Heidi were really responsive - emailing quickly and responding to texts quickly.  They even went above and beyond when they found out I was a nursing mom to let me use the apartment past check-out time to pump before we needed to go to the airport.  It was awesome to feel like they were so helpful, responsive, and committed to making sure we had a wonderful stay!"
6268805,80436376,2016-06-18,29065767,Nancy,"I was in town for work and had trouble securing a hotel room that wasn't astronomical.

Everything was perfect and they've added great little touches to make you feel more at home! I highly recommend!"
6268805,81331382,2016-06-22,11135105,Yasaman,Justin & Heidi's place was great and they are very responsive hosts. The pictures are very accurate. The terrace was really amazing to have a cup of coffee on in the morning or a glass of wine in the evening! I would definitely recommend this place!

6268805,87565562,2016-07-20,28480866,Kayla,Justin and Heidi provided a wonderful stay for us! They were very responsive and the instructions for attaining the keys were clear and concise. Their home was perfect; watching the sunset from the private roofdeck was one of the best parts of our day. The complimentary bottle of Chardonnay they provided came in handy and was much appreciated. We had a wonderful stay at their home in Charlestown and would certainly consider returning. Thank you!
6268805,88756264,2016-07-25,3032157,Vanessa,"We had an amazing stay in this lovely Charlestown apartment. It's a beautiful and welcoming place in a charming neighbourhood, close enough to walk in to Boston Centre or even Cambridge if you're up to it."

They made great suggestions for places that I needed to see in Boston. Especially great eating spots. Most of them are in walking distance.  I will definitely stay at their place again.
6268805,91233574,2016-08-04,31304820,Kevin,Justin and Heidi were available for all our needs.  The place was great!
6268805,91681538,2016-08-06,2817111,Arnaud,"Simply one of the best experience I've had on Airbnb.

6268805,95210320,2016-08-18,39153791,Nathaniel,I booked this room for my Cousin and his wife.  They were doing a road trip for their Honeymoon.  Neither of them had ever been to Boston before.
Justin messaged me right away.  He was very forthright and painted a lucid picture of where to find the key.  When my cousin and his wife could enter the premises....etc.,,,,,
Location is great for getting around and you are not far from the Charlestown NavyYard or the Bunker Hill Obelisk.,,,,,
For getting around I would recommend parking the car and taking public transportation.  The T is not far away.,,,,,
They loved the private rooftop and the view of the city.  As well as the view of the Obelisk at night.,,,,,
Justin was more than willing to accommodate them and assured me that if there was anything he could do to make their stay more comfortable then all I had to do was message him.  Needless to say,I never heard a word from them.  Their stay was perfect and they continued to thank me and let me know that they would love to stay there again if they make it back to Boston.,,,,
"Thanks again Justin & Heidi for making their honeymoon trip so memorable.  :-)  I will definitely be checking this place out again the next time I'm in Boston.\"",,,,,
6268805,96922799,2016-08-25,43368164,Sondra,They messaged me all along the way to make sure that I knew what to expect and were easily accessible with any questions before and during my stay.  It was a fantastic experience!!
6268805,98162295,2016-08-29,45862708,Marcy,We really enjoyed our stay!!  Our hosts made everything very easy.  They even provided a bottle of wine that we thoroughly enjoyed on the rooftop deck!!  The apartment was nicely furnished.  The only negative was no air conditioning.  However fans were provided which did help.  Everything else was great!!
2547129,18240908,2014-08-24,16907363,Mario,"El apartamento está en excelentes condiciones, y su ubicación y alrededores muy buenos. Sí eres sensitivo con el ruido tómalo en cuenta, ya que la zona es ruidosa. Por lo demás muy recomendable."
2547129,28819151,2015-03-30,10026070,Nataša & Julian,"This was a fabulous rental in the heart of Boston.  We can echo the words of reviewer Kevin below.  An accurately described, well presented and very cosy apartment with everything you need and ideally placed to move around from the centre.  We would definitely return here again if our travels bring us to Boston. Very well managed with excellent communication from Elyne, the property manager."
2547129,40726460,2015-08-02,31328762,Stefania,"I hade the pleasure to stay at this apartment for two months during summer. Everything was wonderful, the apartment itself is very cozy and spacious and provides everything you need for a perfect stay."
The location is perfect with direct access to the T and the historical centre of Boston and other worth visiting places. North End is a busy and fun area!,,,,,
Elyne was very helpful with everything i needed and responded immediately if anything was needed.,,,,,
"Absolutely highly recommended. \"",,,,,
2547129,79206479,2016-06-11,13894705,Hugo,"Nice, spacious apartment in the heart of Boston. Located around the corner is Faneuil Hall, and on the other corner starts Hanover street, with the many italian restaurants. We stayed a week for a conference, and we did everything by bike. The docks of the Hubway Bike share system are across the street. Boston is very bike friendly, and a nice way to discover the city."
The apartment is nice and has everything you need.,,,,,
It is located above a bar,and they have often live music. But the most noise came from the many airco outdoor units on the roof,"seen and heared through the bedroom window.\"",,,
2547129,80664064,2016-06-19,69404010,Lynn,Elyne was a great host. Her communication was timely. She made keys available for us to pick up at midnight. There was information about the area available in the unit. When we had an issue with the key she was very quick to respond a fix the problem.
The unit is as pictured. Its very comfortable and clean.,,,,,
You can not find a better location in Boston. Close to everything. It is on the Freedom Trail. Walking distance to several historical sites,North End restaurants and the T. The unit is above a bar on a street with several bars,so if noise is an issue this might not work for you.,,,
"I would defiantly stay here again. \"",,,,,
2547129,90424660,2016-08-01,78173283,Peggy,"Location, location, location.  This apt was so convenient to tourist activities, subways, waterfront.  The furnishings are as pictured and the bed was comfortable.  It is a great value compared to hotels in the area and more comfortable with the living area separated from the bedroom.  We did not use anything but the coffeepot and dishes in the kitchen but it is well-equipped.  We were very glad to have air conditioning as the heat and humidity were high while there.  There was some noise from outdoor concerts while we were there and from the bar downstairs.  We would stay at this location again and recommend it."
2547129,91195424,2016-08-04,8207587,Nick,Great trip!
2547129,94373555,2016-08-15,27330006,Navin,"Beautiful apartment, with a great location."
2547129,96652512,2016-08-23,19975405,Julian,"My husband and I stayed for three nights, while a friend of us stayed for six nights."
The ad lists in its amenities: 24-Hour Check-in but this is not the case. We paid for an extra night since our friend was arriving between 1 to 2 am (this was informed to the host and she never mentioned any problem of getting into the apartment),,,,,
The host said key instructions were going to be provided via sms two days before arrival. We had to insist to receive instructions after 24/48 hours prior arrival since our friend did not have an US mobile number.,,,,,
When key instructions were provided,they were not clear. After exchanging several emails,the host mentioned that the main door from the street was closed and locked when the bar was closed between 2 to 11.30 am. When we asked her what options did she have in case our friend's flight was delayed,"she answered \"\"none\"\". We booked with confidence in the first place because the listing features a 24-hour check-in.",,
Anyway,our friend managed to arrive at 1 am,but she couldn't get in since the key instructions were incorrect. We have to call the host at 1 am to provided us the correct key number. She never offered an apology for putting our friend through an uncomfortable situation at 1 in the morning.,,,
And the host never mentioned a cleaning lady was supposed to go during those days. We received the host's phone call on Monday at 9 am to let us know someone was downstairs trying to enter to clean up the apartment. Obviously,nobody was at the apartment since we were on vacations visiting the city.,,,,
Nevertheless,"the apartment and the location were great.\"",,,,
13685207,92403628,2016-08-08,37186043,John,"Clean place, great location - close to shopping, dining and drinking establishments. We found free parking for the weekend with great ease."
"Had a fantastic stay - would definitely stay there with another couple or family again. \"",,,,,
13685207,94372873,2016-08-15,63110550,Scott,Very welcoming host! Very nice apartment for its value. My friends and I were very impressed with the stay
13685207,95133430,2016-08-18,25188162,Yu,Overall pretty good. Good location. Initially the AC did not work which makes the place not comfortable. But later we are so glad that the flatboom team changed us to a new room downstairs. And the new room is even better than the previous one.
13744821,83826254,2016-07-04,71655085,Michael,Sue responded promotly and was very respectful
13744821,86942265,2016-07-18,16466065,Rose,Staying in the North End felt like being at the heart of the city. The apartment was quintessential North End above a pizza shop and up narrow stairwell to the second floor. It was clean and everything worked well. The Hubway bikes were close by and all the great restaurants were right there. Sue left us a nice note explaining everything we needed to know.
"\"",,,,,
13744821,88794180,2016-07-25,67227086,Dan,Sue was very helpful during the booking process and prior to arrival. Arrival arrangements all went well. The apartment is in a perfect location and is really nice. With two bedrooms this is perfect for travelling with kids at a value that a hotel can't touch.
13744821,93960777,2016-08-14,21815164,Natalie,"What a gem in the midst of a vibrant neighborhood! We were so lucky to find this clean and spacious apartment in walking distance to the Greenway, Wharf, aquarium, boats to the Harbor Islands, north end restaurants, bars, shopping and festivals, and even walkable to Newbury street, the Boston Gardens and Quincy market areas. Got our 10,000 steps in!! We did everything we could this weekend and enjoyed the apartment immensely (for two couples).  Sue was super easy to work with, very accommodating, and very clear in her communications. This is a special location. Very good value."

Not only was the apartment super clean, up to date, but you are located in the heart and soul of Boston. Sue was such amazing host and helped us with anything we needed. Highly recommend!"

Beautiful studio in historic area that was great! Just a warning of the steep street in this area - those can be tiring at the end of the day!,,,,,
"Paige is an excellent host and her place is amazing!\"",,,,,
13728510,86719598,2016-07-17,25490825,Connor,Awesome place. Great location. 24 7 access to check in and super simple. Bed was nice and amenities were a good bonus. Had some issues with the shower but they were definitely a one time thing.
13728510,87673610,2016-07-21,2092029,Wendy,"Great neighborhood and easy to access. Modern appliances, including AC. The shower is very small and doesn't drain well."
13728510,89223529,2016-07-27,15535111,Dan,Paige's Beacon Hill apartment is perfect if you want to be right in the middle of the city yet feel like you've traveled a little back in time with the gas lit lamps and brick and cobblestone streets. The apartment is very clean and includes everything you'd need (and more!) to enjoy your stay in Boston.  It's exactly as pictured.
13728510,89478607,2016-07-28,1748401,Ken,"Last minute rental for biz trip -- very easy communication -- immaculate space -- very nice neighborhood -- cute, quiet (exactly as pictured), TV and A/C worked --clean towels, comfortable bed -- absolutely zero complaints.  (And half the price of a hotel!)"
13728510,91474980,2016-08-05,30601956,Richard,Great neighborhood and easy access to the major T lines. We spent a whole week looking a colleges and never needed a car.
13728510,92498460,2016-08-08,2673105,Rebecca,"Location! If you want to stay in a fantastic location at a reasonable price, Paige's place is excellent. We were a 5 minute walk to coffee shops, restaurants, the Boston Commons / Public Garden, the Charles River, and so much more. My husband are walkers, so we were even able to walk to some of the main tourist attractions (e.g., Quincy Market, the North End)--1/2 mile to 1 mile away. The bed was very comfortable, and we enjoyed the new, modern renovation."
13728510,93986750,2016-08-14,7085805,Lisa,"Best neighbour in Boston. The studio was nice, clean and totally new. We just had a problem with the shower just arrived which was immediately fixed by the owner. I recommend this place if you plan a travel to Boston."
13728510,95381806,2016-08-19,72402608,Matías,"This small studio is brand new, beautiful, and has everything one needs, including a full size kitchen. Large windows allow great light in. The neighborhood is quiet and gorgeous, super close to MGH and the T, and walking distance to downtown. The apartment complex is quiet, the hallways are dirty and old. The shower needs to be fixed, but still works. The shower glass door is falling/does not close, the faucet leaks, is hard to open/close, and the shower does not drain well."
10037387,68316639,2016-04-04,47506132,Andy,Excellent location!  The unit was clean with nice furnishings.  Will return for sure

10037387,72075795,2016-04-30,28593844,Shelly,"Outstanding location and gorgeous apartment. Extremely clean with every amenity thought out. Surprising bright, very welcoming. Our family of four had plenty of room. We walked to Fenway, Northeastern University, Quincy Market. Great shopping, easy parking. We cannot wait to visit again!"
10037387,73685166,2016-05-09,57643069,Connolly,"We were very happy with the apartment we rented in the Back Bay area.  This was our first experience with Airbnb and we weren't sure what to expect.  The pictures accurately depicted the apartment.  It was conveniently stocked with towels, sheets, kitchenware, toiletries, etc., and most importantly, very clean.  We were comfortable there and will definitely choose this over a hotel next time we're in Boston.  The area it was located in a beautiful (which we already knew).  I would highly recommend Airbnb to friends and family!"

10037387,77221900,2016-05-30,57790557,Jessica,"Great stay with Inn Boston. The apartment was clean and had all of the essentials. I only wish that the lighting was a little better in the apartment, specifically in the bedrooms but aside from that, no complaints! The neighborhood was really great - there were a lot of shops and restaurants in the area and we were able to bike to nearby areas without a problem.  Would stay with Inn Boston again."

Cons: Air conditioning hardly worked at all -- it was in the high 70's in the apartment; the ceiling fan did not work at all; the place smelled (my wife said it smelled like cat); the bathroom was pretty cramped; carpet was Lina gross; the sound on the second tv was very spotty; and overall they could have provided a few more touches (e.g. Kleenex,liquid soap,etc.).,,,
Additional note: This did not bother me,but it should be disclosed that the staircase into the basement is a bit long and steep -- if you have a disability or otherwise cannot carry your luggage down a long/steep flight,"this place is not for you.\"",,,
10037387,80738302,2016-06-19,65827468,Jolinda,The host sent us the access information well before our visit which helped reassure us that the reservation was still good and that we could get into the apartment easily. The description and pictures of the apartment were accurate. The neighborhood was wonderful. Lots of great shops and easy access to the subway. We were there to go to a couple of Red Sox games and this apartment was a very good location for that.
10037387,82543063,2016-06-28,47497599,Yiling,"Inn Boston's service is really nice and accommodate our special requirements. Really put their customers' satisfactions at the first priority. The house is clean and tidy in the greatest location. The only thing is the apartment is in the basement and one bedroom is not exactly a bedroom, but Inn Boston helped us to change to the first floor unit which is better for my parents."
10037387,84352106,2016-07-06,32146606,Nicole,"\"Check-in was easy and convenient. Even though we arrived early and went to the rental office to drop our bags, the woman at the desk arranged for us to check in early to the apt and drop our bags while the cleaner was still there. The location is great, in the heart of the Back Bay. Now the Oh-no-nos: the carpet is gross and should be ripped out. It was so old and dirty-looking I didn't want to step on it in bare feet. The AC was set to 78 and we couldn't turn it any lower so it was stuffy and hot the whole time (it was 90 outside). We called the office and someone came to \"\"fix\"\" it but it still never went below 78 so they must set it that high on purpose. Not OK. The apartment is in the basement and the lighting is poor - it's either really low so you can't see"
10037387,85172516,2016-07-10,23942617,Michele,The apartment was in a very great location everything was very clean and easy to use. The host provided us details weeks in advance and it was very clear and timely. Would definitely recommend!
10037387,89732555,2016-07-29,40965178,Ranu,We had a brilliant stay at the apartment. It was exactly as shown in the pictures and was a good size for us (4 adults and a 6 month old baby) It was very clean and I liked the fact it had a keypad entry. It was a little dark but that didn't bother us as we were out in the sun all day and it was a cool respite when we got in!
The location of the apartment was fantastic! It was just around the corner from Newbury street and a short walk to the public garden and an even shorter walk to the Prudential Tower. The hosts were always available via email and we were able to get a late check despite only emailing at 8pm the night before.,,,,,

13391640,80060977,2016-06-15,38099392,Dominic,"Great location.  When I rented it, I assumed it was a private apartment that was setup as a short term rental.  It is actually an apartment that is lived in by the primary tenant, and rented out occasionally.  So there is a lot of personal stuff there.  A bit like spending the night at your daughter's apartment.  If you are okay with that, then this is a great value.  Madison is a very nice young lady and she made an extra effort to make sure I got the key when I arrived in Boston, and even picked it up from me at work the following day, rather than making me track her down."

Madison was great at communication with texts. It was an awesome loft space. Tiny kitchen so not good if you wanted to cook. We were really only there to sleep so it was perfect for the weekend!"
13391640,87521159,2016-07-20,52212878,Barrett,Host was very responsive and helpful. The apartment has an excellent location. My only complaint is the place is very dirty.
13391640,88857379,2016-07-25,42972194,Karle,The place was beautiful and very clean. We appreciated Madison meeting us to give us the keys too! The apartment is in a very safe and nice area with mostly young people and students. We could easily walk to the Copley T stop and travel basically everywhere we needed to go! We had an excellent trip and would both book with Madison again and stay here too.
13391640,89802984,2016-07-30,7076137,Ben,This was a great place right in a perfect location in Back Bay. It is indeed a spacious studio as promised and all went well. Communication was very good. Thanks!
13391640,92522348,2016-08-09,76174952,Danielle,This apartment has an amazing location and has a really relaxed vibe inside. It wasn't as clean as a hotel but that is to be expected. The big downside for me was that there is normally a cat living there and as someone who is allergic to cats that would have a been a deal breaker when considering booking. I started having allergy symptoms within the first hour of being there and thats a bummer when you're on vacation!
12826881,76772250,2016-05-29,58602760,Jonny,"Stella wasn't in when we arrived, but had left everything ready for us and her housemate kindly let us in. The room was a good size but unfortunately the kitchen was very small, so this is not a place for those who plan to make elaborate meals during their stay. It fitted our needs fine, however, and the place is very well situated within a minute's walk of a T line (although Boston is very walkable) and about 5 minute's walk from the Museum of Fine Arts, which I recommend highly. Please note that there is no living area for guests other than the bedroom, so on the occasions you decide to eat in you will find yourself without a dining table."

She was friendly and responded very timely to all messages, questions, etc. The apartment was clean, easily accessible via the T and in a very convenient, lively part of town. I enjoyed being so close to the Museum of Fine Arts a short walk from Fenway and a short T ride from the theater district. The room feels very private in the front of the apartment. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend the room to who are in need of a place to sleep while in Boston!"

Her two roommates were kind and kept my privacy. The location was great, very convenience to public transportation. The room and the shared bath room were kind of clean but a little bit too old.  One thing must mention, on weekend night, there was too noisy outside the room window, as the neighborhood talked too loudy in mid night."

Definitely recommend it to those who wants more privacy as I was staying with my BF. It has a living room and cooking space and s small room without door. Neighborhood is quiet. And I really love the welcome note from her,"it warms my heart :)\"",,,,
12835086,78720825,2016-06-08,70366204,Robert,Very nice! Thank you :)
12835086,79591380,2016-06-13,63363709,Renee,"Deirdra was very accommodating with our check in time and departure time. The whole process went smoothly. Also, she quickly answered texts from me about parking and other things. She was very helpful."
12835086,79776082,2016-06-14,24941053,Cecilia,Very clean and comfortable listing! Deirdra was great at answering any of our questions and very helpful.
12835086,81129625,2016-06-21,2176395,Marco,"Good communication.  Not a short walk, but room was close enough to walk to the convention center."
12835086,83070064,2016-07-01,17560573,Peter,"Great neighborhood, large apartment, comfortable space."
12835086,84048164,2016-07-05,13795740,Ana Cristina,Buena ubicacion y Deirdra muy pendiente. Sin embargo el apto estaba muy sucion y algo descuidado... El interios del edificio muy abandonado poco agradable. No lo recomiendo
12835086,84311303,2016-07-06,65715136,Erik,We enjoyed very much two nights in Deidras apartment. A lovely apartment in the  Boston South area.
"The apartment and the dialog with Deidra at all levels met our requirements.\"",,,,,
12835086,85638603,2016-07-12,75890767,Noeleen,First experience of using Airbnb and it was great! Deirdra was easy to get in contact with if we had any questions. The apartment had everything we needed and was in a good area for getting in and out of the city. Would definitely recommend for a stay in Boston!
12835086,89331760,2016-07-28,21788757,Jay,Great communication. Very easy in and out and flexible about check in and check out times. Location is great and convenient for seeing almost anywhere in Boston proper.
12835086,92492538,2016-08-08,5711866,Anna Neuwert,"Deidra var en fin vært, hun var let at komme i kontakt med. Lejligheden var også ok, men bar præg af at hun ikke selv bor der. Køkkenet var mangelfuldt og havde ikke alle de nødvendige ting, som man forventer der er. Der manglede nogle enkelte ting, da vi ankom, ex sengelinned til den ene seng og håndsæbe til toilettet."
12835086,95102380,2016-08-18,45531047,Jilly,"The living room and kitchen are very spacious in this apartment. It's a perfect apartment for a couple, a solo traveller, or a couple of friends as there's a great couch in the living room. Deirdra was very quick to get in touch with any queries I had and she left a nice note and chocolates for our arrival. The location is great - a short walk to the T and only a few stops to downtown. Thanks for a nice stay!"
12835086,96360260,2016-08-22,70914605,Dawn,"Inexpensive, roomy, lots of places to eat nearby.  Deirdra was very friendly and responded quickly to all questions.  Only concern is if you plan to do much cooking, the kitchen is not set up for that."
12835086,97326211,2016-08-26,31577993,Remy Et Stéphanie,"Located a few blocs away from Broadway, we stayed 2 nights at Deirdra's apartment. Great communication with our host, it was simple to check in and check out. We felt like the bathroom could have been cleaner and we would have probably enjoyed a microwave in the kitchen."
12835086,99346725,2016-09-04,7406874,Emily,"Perfect location, clean and safe area! Exactly what we were looking for for the labor day weekend. It was a bare necessities home but, that was all we needed. :) thanks for opening your home to us! Will definitely be coming back here again!"
9826706,57938489,2015-12-30,3525899,Ben,"Great place, awesome location, everything you need in the building. There's a Dunkin Donuts across the street, so you'll always have coffee. Josh and his wife have a super cute apartment that can definitely sleep 4 or more if you bring an air mattress."
"Any time again! \"",,,,,
9826706,83893286,2016-07-04,15902891,Salvador,Very nice place and nice apartment ! Nice neighbourhood! The apartment was nice!  I recommend this place!
9826706,94674946,2016-08-16,61390653,Carissa,Overall great experience. The apartment was what we expected and Josh was a great host.
5755910,37980964,2015-07-12,33531438,Kwanwoo,"Her house is located in the most convenient place in North end.  5min to Haymarket and North Station, and 10 min to Quincy market and harbor.  Very clean and well equipped(aircon laundry etc) Highly recommended, anyone with family."
5755910,39740318,2015-07-26,30738587,Cliff,"Joy was an excellent host and a pleasure to work with. The property was exactly as described. The condo is comfortable and very conveniently located with easy access to the T and the North End. We enjoyed frequent trips to the markets and restaurants that make the North End a great spot to stay. The building itself is quiet but lies along a busy street, so the sounds of the city start early in the morning. The condo is well appointed and immaculate."
5755910,40923943,2015-08-03,12516207,Mandy,"Joy immediately welcomed our family with a very friendly email introducing herself and welcoming us to her home for our upcoming trip. Her listing description is very accurate of her home. It is a very clean home. However, she fails to mention how super comfortable the master bed is!"
The neighborhood is full of wonderful restaurants,dessert houses and watering holes. The neighborhood is very safe and family friendly. Our family spent each evening in the park having dessert,fruit from the market and letting the kids play in the fountains. There is a Whole Foods a short drive away. The Childrens Museum,"Science Museum and Aquarium are all within walking distance. \"",,
5755910,88572131,2016-07-24,32082956,Carolann,"Joy was very communicative and easy to coordinate with. She made us feel welcome in her home, which was clean and looks just like the pictures. She was also flexible with our arrival/departure times to help us with our early flights. I would definitely recommend Joy's apartment, especially if you have a family. The location was also perfect, there are several great restaurants and bakeries nearby as well as the North Station which made getting around town a breeze."
5755910,95112039,2016-08-18,59772902,Kris,"The apartment was in such a great location.  The photos make it appears there is a major road outside the window, which there is. Only the major auto traffic is underground in the “big Dig” and the area outside, while there are roads going along it, is the green space.  The number of awesome restaurants within short walking distance to Little Italy far exceeds the ability to try them all.  And while you are walking around the neighborhood, you will be within blocks or even feet of so many historical places including Paul Revere's home, North Church, etc.  Going a bit farther south and east and you are on the pier and the aquarium.  A short walk across the green space and you are going to be at Faneuil Hall, Old State House, and Market Square."
We have never been in such a well equipped unit.  The kitchen was fully functional and not just bare necessities.  The instructions for climate control and entertainment were very well laid out and simple to follow.  The washer and dryer functioned perfectly and allowed for lighter packing to accommodate fresh clothes throughout our visit.,,,,,
The cleanliness of the apartment was top notch. Once again,the instructions for post visit departure and garbage/recycling were well described and easy to understand.,,,,
One thing that might note attention is the third floor location without elevator/lift.,,,,,
The entire apartment was exactly as pictured,"and the furniture was well above average for a rental.  The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen/living area were equally great places to rest.\"",,,,
5048406,26368080,2015-02-10,26500645,Hobin,"I had a friend coming from Korea and needed a place to stay for one day in Boston. And that's how I got to meet the Jones. I cannot appreciate them enough for their hospitality and kindness they extended to both my friend and me. They were so warmhearted, welcoming, and caring people. They sat down to talk to us. They made us supper and breakfast, even though they did not have to. I really recommend that you stay with them if you need a place in Boston, and I guarantee you won't be sorry!"
5048406,32389724,2015-05-17,31934738,Satvika,"Yvonne was a wonderful host! She made me feel extremely welcome and her house is beautiful. I was able to come and go as I liked, but also able to chat with her and her husband. Loved staying here, and would definitely recommend. It's pretty easy to get into Boston proper from the house as well, which is an added bonus!"
5048406,32729148,2015-05-20,33388772,Morgane,BEST HOST EVER !
Yvonne nous a vraiment bien accueillis,malgré notre arrivée tardive. Le lit de notre chambre était très confortable,la salle de bain propre et nous avons eu des serviettes propres et un petit déjeuner chaque matin. Yvonne et son mari sont très ouverts à la conversation et Yvonne nous gentiment fait faire le tour de la ville en voiture pour nous montrer ce que nous avions manqué par nous-mêmes : plage,caserne des pompiers,université MIT... Le dernier jour,Yvonne nous a même amené à la gare des bus. C'était un séjour très agréable
5048406,33627944,2015-05-30,21086624,Laura,We loved staying at Yvonne's place!! She was very nice and made us feel comfortable at her house. We learned a lot about Boston thanks to her and her husband and spent quality time together and we enjoyed it a lot!
She drove us to places and that was very kind! She also offered breakfast :),,,,,
We have nothing to say but positive things about them and hope to see them again!,,,,,

The accommodations were clean, spacious, and exactly as advertised. My stay was short (1 night), but I look forward to staying at there again. Safe neighborhood. This was an excellent choice!"
5048406,35228794,2015-06-16,9421514,Yoko,"Thank you for everything Yvonne, your husband, and Nico. I felt like I was a member of your family. She offered me breakfast and dinner. They even gave me drives to places I needed to go. My stay at her house with her family was kind of homestay rather than B&B. House was clean and beautiful and my room was big. Her house is near bus stop called Trull St. if you take bus 17 from Andrew T station."
5048406,42144900,2015-08-11,35669676,Sajithya,"Ms. Yvonne and Bob made me feel really welcome and part of the family.  They were gracious hosts and would often welcome us to join meals or outings together.  While there are no trains that are within walking distance, there is a bus stop very close by within 5 minutes walk."
5048406,45545425,2015-09-03,43054779,Stephen,Didn't stay at home.
5048406,45751744,2015-09-05,41276476,Pia,"Yvonne's victorian house is a beautiful place amidst a wonderful city. There is a lot of space, our room was quite huge like the rest of the house. We  were warmly welcomed by our hosts and felt comfortable right from the beginning. If you are planning a trip to Boston, I can only recommend you to book this accomodation."
5048406,46506167,2015-09-11,41432503,Logan,"Yvonne picked me up from the airport, offered me breakfast on multiple occasions and sent texts that helped improve my experience. She even drove me around the neighborhood pointing out the best spots to eat. The house was very clean and close by everything you would need while traveling and metro."
5048406,46806452,2015-09-13,32132322,D'Juan,Yvonne was extremely responsive from inquiry all the way through the booking stage.
5048406,48027641,2015-09-22,28894371,Otuya,"I loved the warm welcome that I was given by Yvonne, mama King, and Bobbie. They are an amazing family to stay with. Yvonne always bent backwards to help me and my fiancee. The house is full of culture and you will never feel bored. The room I was given was spacious, the bed was big, I had cable TV. If you really want to enjoy Boston, you should consider staying with the Jones!"
5048406,48260226,2015-09-24,44089044,Travis,Yvonne is a great person. You can tell that see is super loving and loves her family. As soon as I got there she made my girlfriend and me feel like apart of the family.
I am sooo thankful for her. I miss calculated how many night I was going to stay in Boston and I needed a room QUICK. She was super fast to respond and approve me to stay in her lovely house.,,,,,
Yvonne is a great host. I meet her brother and grandmother. Both were great people. The house is huge! The bed room was HUGE! with a Huge soft bed. Oh man the bed my girlfriend and I got to sleep on was Awesome!,,,,,
I cannot tell you enough how great of an experience I had.,,,,,
"Thank You very much Yvonne. I cannot thank you enough.\"",,,,,

5048406,49570195,2015-10-04,4064761,Lucia,Yvonne is an excellent host. She and her family were very nice and welcoming with me and they really made me feel at home.
The room is exactly as shown in the listing,it's very large,so is the bed and it's very comfortable. Yvonne's house is big and they invited me to use the kitchen whenever I needed,and I also shared some very nice moments with the family in their lovely and cozy living room. The house is conveniently located near bus stops that take you to the T red line station,and coming and going downtown is a very easy ride,which takes about 40 minutes
As a host,Yvonne is very attentive and kind,she picked me up and dropped me off at the bus station and she was always very attentive,wanting to make sure I had all I needed,and responded to all my messages very quickly.,
"I really enjoyed my stay at the Jones' and I hope I'll be able to come back someday. It's a highly recommendable place to stay while in Boston. Thanks for your hospitality and for being so nice with me \"",,,,,

5048406,52008513,2015-10-25,37138251,Matthew,"Yvonne and Bob were wonderful hosts! I had such a nice stay in their big, beautiful house. Yvonne was very attentive to my needs and schedule when I came to Boston for a conference. The house is really big and so is the yard if you have kids(!) Bob was great to let me store my bike in his basement and the room upstairs was large and spacious with tv and a nice large comfortable bed. In the morning they made me coffee and a nice breakfast and even invited me to dinner in the evenings(!) The free on street parking is a MAJOR selling point too if you're coming to Boston. Except for Sundays it is very difficult to find free and even available afternoon parking closer to downtown so it was great to be able to keep my car parked on the street in their residential neighborhood for free."
5048406,53193980,2015-11-06,31458401,Frédéric,"The house is very nice, the room is very large and the bed comfortable. Yvonne and her husband Bob were very nice. Bob offered me the breakfast the first day. I also arrived later than expected the first evening (after 10 pm) and it was not a problem. The location is quite good. It is possible to be in downtown within 30 minutes by walking until Saving Hill (15') and taking the red line."

14242888,92299515,2016-08-08,51333717,Michael,"Staying with Althea was a pleasure. I had a last minute need and she patiently made up my room, coordinated arrival, and made sure I was taken care of each step of the way. She has a joyful, generous spirit from Jamaica that makes you feel welcome not just as a passerby but as a family friend."
14242888,94672638,2016-08-16,48511058,Michael,"\"A very \"\"no frills\"\" bnb experience. The area is a decent quiet neighborhood about 15 minutes from downtown Boston. Althea was a very gracious host and quite accommodating."
"Breakfast is \"\"continental\"\" and self prepared. Guests are allowed one egg and their choice of an English muffin or bread",and coffee/tea/juice. Cereal,jam and peanut butter were also offered.,,,
Temperature in the house was on the stuffy side (79-80F) to accommodate other guests who complained of cold,however the host was amenable to adjusting it.,,,,

14242888,97025148,2016-08-25,33784584,Francelia,"We, my sister and I, will recommend Althea and her family any time. If Airbnb has rockstar level service that goes for her. Her house is really clean, her care is superb and they are really helpful. We booked an Airbnb prior to her, but they never replied to us so we cancel that. We were glad that we did, so Althea took care of us with advices, food and a home where to stay. If you are choosing a place in Boston, don't think it twice and stay with her. You will not regret it."

We arrived around 5am from an overnight flight and she was very accomodating in letting us rest and in getting the room ready extremely quickly despite the fact that someone else still had the room. The house was very pleasant to stay in and I loved talking to them about things to do in Boston. I would definitely stay with them again!
13884549,90929736,2016-08-03,21309260,Ramon,"Lais was a very nice host, the location is perfect to explore boston. Metro station is a small walk away and the neighbourhood is quiet. The beds were not the best (very soft) but good enough. Kitchen has everything we needed (including waffle maker :)) and grocery is located accross the street. We had a great time exploring Boston."
13884549,92878807,2016-08-10,82197437,Isaias,"Lais fue muy amable y comprensiva, pues tuvimos un serio atraso con el vuelo y llegamos de madrugada sin problema. Todo se encontraba en su lugar, el aire acondicionado, la iluminación, servicios sanitarios, etc... No tuvimos ningún problema al respecto. La casa está muy bien ubicada, cerca del aeropuerto, y muy cerca de la estación del tren, de manera que es fácil llegar casi a cualquier lugar, además de ser un vecindario muy seguro y tranquilo."

Das Zimmer (ausgestattet mit aircon und tv) ist sehr geräumig und sauber sowie der Rest der Wohnung. In der Küche ist alles vorhanden und darf mitgenutzt werden. Die Lage der Wohnung ist auch sehr gut. Die T ist suber schnell zu erreichen. Der Flughafen sowie das Zentrum sind nur eine Station weit entfernt. Deshalb würde ich es zu 100% weiter empfehlen. Grüße Denise"
13884549,93631558,2016-08-13,50579366,Martina,"Very good location, one stop from airport and one from the downtown. Lais and Liz were very nice and hospitable and gave us a lot of information. Everything was perfect, we'll come back again."

It is in a cozy apartment, which is older, but quite clean. The deck off the back was a great place to relax after a long day of walking. Also enjoyed talking with Lais and Liz (apartment mate) and getting to know them a bit. I would definitely go back on a return trip to Boston."
13884549,94681266,2016-08-16,2947265,Raye,We stayed for just one night at Lais' because I need to catch my flight on next day. Lais is quick in responding when I ask questions. She's always kind and polite.  We didn't have chance to meet Lais in person but we met Ian and Liz. They both nice and kind.
13884549,95263858,2016-08-19,86209621,Dennys,"The host was amazing and accommodating. The place is very comforting and the host made us feel at home.

It was our first night in the US - although it took us some more time than expected to arrive at Lais' apartment, this was no problem at all. The communication via Airbnb was easy. Lais and her (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) helped us with everything. The flat is located in walking distance to the airport. In case we come back to Boston, we'd love to stay here again."
13884549,95644717,2016-08-20,68111743,Kristen,Lais and Liz were very welcoming!

13884549,96006143,2016-08-21,78777530,Denise,"Und auch beim zweiten Aufenthalt gab es nichts zu beanstanden. Es wurde sogar im Zeitraum zwischen unseren 1. und 2. Besuch (also innerhalb einer Woche) sogar eine neue Matratze und ein neues Regal organisiert. Wenn wir wieder in Boston sind, werden wir definitv auch ein drittes Mal die Unterkunft von Lais buchen."
13884549,97038658,2016-08-25,82160218,Mickayla,"Before getting to Lais and Liz's apartment, there was a dog that had run away from its home and into the street. Three people, as well as my companion and I, stopped to help the dog find its home. I think that says plenty about the neighborhood. Quick walk to the train; it was super easy to get anywhere we needed to go. Liz especially was very helpful in recommending food places and directions when we were lost. When we got there, they provided toiletries and stuff that we had forgotten, like shampoo and bath towels, things like that. It was the little things that made it such an enjoyable stay. They weren't home for most of our trip, which was okay because we were rarely there, either. It's overall a convenient location in the middle of one of the most beautiful cities I've ever been to. I'd love to stay again if they'd be willing to have me. If you're considering to stay at Lais and Liz's house, do it! The beds are comfortable and the apartment is clean. Thank you guys!"

It just took us 10 minutes from airport to the apartment. Lais gave us a super easy info about the best way.,,,,,
The Subway is 2 minutes walk from there apartment,so you get easily to everywhere you want.,,,,
We also liked the neighborhood,everyone was nice and directly in front of the apartment is a small store where you get all you need.,,,,
On the maverick square we also found a shop which sold us SIM Cards for our phones.,,,,,
It was a amazing stay and we would do it anytime again !,,,,,

848152,3942994,2013-03-29,3574662,Doug,"Alisa was a wonderful host, and the apartment is very nice."
848152,5929644,2013-07-22,6899788,Mattias,"The apartment was really nice! Both spacious and comfy, with very nice bathroom and kitchen. Definitely big enough for two friends. Easy to get in and out of central Boston via the Orange Line."
848152,6037244,2013-07-27,7611186,Myriam,"We rented the apartment for a trip to Boston with friends. The apartment was clean, well situated within short walking distance from the subway. The apartment was a bit noisy (air conditioning, nearby commuter train, neighbors) but quiet at night. Finally, Alisa has been very patient when we got stuck in traffic during rush hour on our way there."
848152,6182723,2013-08-02,7576594,Ellen,"Alisa was a gracious hostess and very responsive. Her apartment was exactly as specified and very comfortable and outfitted very well. It was a nice place for my family to stay during our visit. For our purposes, it was not as centrally located in Boston as we would have liked and the surrounding area was a bit too rough for our comfort, but we should have investigated the area more thoroughly; the location was certainly not misrepresented in any way. We were just knowledgeable about Boston areas and did not know what was “good” and what was “bad”. Also, while the “T” was certainly within walking distance, the noise from the trains passing by at early hours very close to the apartment was not welcome"
848152,7161037,2013-09-09,7590640,Bevely,"While attending our daughter's wedding in Boston, we stayed in Alisa's apartment. The description on the airbnb website is exactly what we found and we definitely appreciated the French press. The apartment was very comfortable and inviting. The location was great for us because we had events in both central Boston and Jamaica Plain. There is easy access to several T-stations and available parking on the street outside the apartment. You can hear the trains as they start running in the early morning, but otherwise we found it very peaceful. Alisa was a gracious hostess and kindly left us a bottle of champagne for the weekend celebrations. We would definitely recommend this apartment to others visiting Boston."
848152,7853870,2013-10-06,7529449,Andrea,"I was contacted by Alisa the day before, telling that she would't be able to check us in before 8:30 although the advertisement says 13:00. Since we were traveling from Niagara and we drove the whole day it was disappointing to not be able to get in before 8:30. Also, we were there by 8:30 but the couple (Alisa and Kacey) was still about 20 minutes late - not pleasant after a 8 hour drive."
"I was also told \"\"I am preparing for your arrival today and tomorrow\"\".",,,,,
The house was not dirty - but it was clearly not clean either,nor was ready for us. Some of the bed linen were smelly (like weird smelling),although later Alisa confirmed that they were coming from the drier just before we arrived (wasn't supposed to be already prepared?). The dishwasher was full with the guests dishes - which we had to wash by ourselves during our stay.,,,
Although the WiFi PW was on the fridge,we didn't really get instruction until the day after.,,,,
We were pretty disappointed when we first arrived.,,,,,
The noise from the railway is not a problem if you keep the windows closed,which we did - although the apartment would get ridiculous warm and not that comfortable during the night - I am talking about 81 to 85 F. We are used to sleep with 65-70,so it was pretty uncomfortable.,,,
We also were asked to leave before 12.00,although the advertisement says 13.00.,,,,
The experience was not bad,but being on holiday we definitely felt unwelcome when we first arrived. After that first moment,the stay was ok.,,,
The price is a bit high for what you get,"considering that we paid 25$ for cleaning fees as well!\"",,,,
848152,8294508,2013-10-24,4612878,Vanessa,"Convenient location to train in an up and coming area with  good access to the city.  Cozy loft style apartment in clean building comfortable for four adults more is somewhat tight. The building was close to the train tracks and was loud when the windows were open.  Overall, nice place to stay."
848152,8382291,2013-10-28,6813065,Matthias,The apartment was totally gorgeous! We stayed two nights with four persons and the available space was perfect. Also Alisa had a warm welcome for us and showed us around.
Thank you for the great time,"Alisa!\"",,,,
848152,8524175,2013-11-04,8855444,Tim,Alisa and her husband were very accommodating. The apartment was accurately described in the listing and proved to be plenty of space for a group of 6 that didn't mind being a little close to one another. It was a very easy cab ride to everywhere we wanted to go in  Boston.
848152,10560747,2014-02-24,12403909,Jared,"There were no problems! Alisa and her husband Kacey were super friendly and helpful! We had to check in really late and they were really accommodating. The place is very nice, roomy, and clean. If I go to Boston again, I would stay here! Definitely recommended."
848152,11570492,2014-04-07,1913476,Jorge And Eleonora,"I had a great stay here! The apartment was very well located near the subway, Alisa and Kacey were friendly hosts, and the room was cozy and clean. A+"
848152,11734047,2014-04-14,9682455,Julian,"Perfect location, great for our needs and really nice hosts."
"train nearby can be a bit annoying but honestly after a while you dont notice them.  Building and apt was beautiful.  \"",,,,,
848152,12109836,2014-04-23,10554739,April,"The apartment was very spacious and accommodated our group of five during Boston Marathon weekend. Street parking was safe and remained lit at night, the T was super close and glad to see that Zip Car was available for a future stay. Alisa and Kacey were friendly, answering my questions promptly and providing convenient check-in and out. My only negatives:"
- A cat lives there,and with horrible allergies,I required medication during our whole weekend. :(,,,
- The fridge and freezer were pretty full,so it was tough for us to fit our groceries in there.,,,,
- The range,oven and microwave were pretty messy upon arrival.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
848152,16962797,2014-08-04,6725511,Polina,"Really great host! The hosts were both super nice and the place was clean and tidy. The apartment is very close to all the attractions so it was convenient for us to travel around. They gave us the key whenever needed and Alisa even made us breakfast one morning! A very pleasant and cute couple who were extremely friendly and even went out of their way to show us maps of Boston and some cool areas to check out. The only minus would be the weather was on the chilly side and rainy, which we weren't prepared for."
848152,18506803,2014-08-27,15646031,Veronika,"Even though we never met Alisa, it was a pleasure for us to stay in her apartment. It was pretty big, very clean and cozy. The location is awesome. It's just a 10 minutes walk to the orange line. Unfortunately we broke one of the wedding cups and had to buy a new one. To manage that in a foreign country was kinda difficult, but of course we did. I would definitely recommend Alisa's Apartment, we had a great time in Boston!"
848152,21797300,2014-10-24,5812631,Vincent,Notre hôte nous a attendu et donné les informations nécessaires sur l'appartement. L'appartement était très propre et les lits préparés. Nous avons passé un excellent séjour dans cet appartement. Il faut savoir que l'appartement est situé à proximité immédiate des voies aériennes de métro que l'on entend quand les fenêtres sont ouvertes.
848152,22356303,2014-11-04,19502919,Amber,Alisa and Kasey were very nice and inviting. The apartment was clean and cozy. There was more than enough room for 4 of us. We made breakfast every morning in the kitchen. It was a quick 5 minute walk to the Orange Line that takes you downtown. If we visit Boston again we will definitely see if their place is available.
848152,30455249,2015-04-22,22606545,Molly,Alisa was great - check-in and check-out was easy and convenient - she was quick to respond to texts and messages and always helpful.
The sleeping arrangements were perfect for 6 (we had 2 each in the bedsm one on the air mattress and 1 on the couch) and the air mattress was already set up for us.,,,,,
"Close walk to the orange line and Alisa provided great directions from the stop!\"",,,,,
848152,33328377,2015-05-26,30671186,Bakhoroi,"The house is as on pic except dirty carpet, kitchen and (URL HIDDEN) all house was not ready for our arriving. And its noisy bcz of train and highway. It was high priced and you have to find everything on your own like wifi, essentials etc...i wont stay again at this place"
848152,33569489,2015-05-30,1599523,Hyun (Jean),"Perfect for a large group (5-6ppl) stay. Everything was clean and as described. I didnt get to meet Alisa, but she was fast to respond to any questions and provided us with all the information we needed to check in and out."
848152,35430066,2015-06-18,35588086,Berit,We enjoyed our time in Alisas Appartement and in Boston a lot.
848152,39862213,2015-07-26,12615692,Jimena,"We met Alisa and her husband. She is a great host and her apartement is really nice, very comfortable for 6 persons... We had a great time there."
848152,40178729,2015-07-28,19806102,Xingjian,"That's a great place, but the train always make some noise."
848152,40987125,2015-08-03,14292713,Robert,Apt as described. We had two cars and found parking on the street for both. Check in and check out were easy. Very comfortable beds including floor bed to accomidate six. Beds were ready to sleep in when we arrived. Plenty of towels for the shower.  NetFlix kept grandma entertained. Well equiped kitchen that we did not use on this trip. A nice list of restaurants and maps available. WiFi worked without a hitch. We did not use public transportation this trip so cannot comment. 10 minutes to downtown boston by car not in rush hour. Would certainly book here again.
848152,48905785,2015-09-29,40756465,Raha,We were 6 students and spent 6 nights at alisas loft. We were totally happy with this apartment. The train station is close to the apartment and the neighborhood is very nice. Alisa is a great and well organized host. Communication with her was perfect and she was very helpful and flexible with regard to Check-in /-out time. As mentioned the train rails are close to the loft so when sleeping with open windows (e.g. in summer) it is a bit noisy. But all in all totally recommendable!
848152,64262111,2016-03-01,40640613,Frederic,Alisa was very nice and it was easy to join her.
The loft was as the description,no surprise,we were happy. 5 minutes walk to the orange line as described.,,,
Special thanks to Alisa for her flexibility,"we've really appreciated.\"",,,,
848152,69563823,2016-04-11,28756748,Jian,"Alisa's place was great, just as how she described it.  The host was really nice, she show us the loft apartment before she left and gave us details information as to where to eat and go (so helpful). The loft apartment was spacious and the bedroom sizes were large. I would recommend this place to everyone."
848152,71281930,2016-04-24,61435245,John,"The place was spacious and had plenty of sleeping arrangements for our large party. Water pressure was good and an all around clean environment. Being that close to the orange line was perfect for exploring the city, just a few blocks walk to full access to Boston. The host was nothing but polite leaving towels and nicely kept beds. I would recommend the place to anyone looking for a beautiful home away from home."
848152,71991376,2016-04-30,65737728,Amanda,"Our hosts were extremely welcoming. They gave us some great information about the area. The loft was nicely decorated; spacious enough so we didn't feel cramped. The building was architecturally interesting; a renovated factory with exposed brick, nice art, very tall ceilings."
848152,74404388,2016-05-15,6333927,Briana,"Alisa was very responsive prior to us arriving. She had a family member meet us since she was unable to. I think that some things weren't explained/we forgot to ask (where the extra air mattress was located, no garbage can in the kitchen) due to this, but everyone was very gracious. We didn't reach out to Alisa during our stay since nothing was of major concern and we dealt just fine. The only gripe the group had was that the air conditioning was broken. The family member made it known, but I would have appreciated being told before we got there."
The neighborhood is apparently not a great one according to locals,but it's very close to public transportation and we never once felt unsafe or unwelcome. The apartments are very nice for the area,I think. Parking was very easy and we didn't move our two cars the entire weekend and they were fine.,,,
Alisa's apartment is a great find at a great price and although a little further out of the central city,"it's easy to navigate. We had a great time.\"",,,,
9274587,54479778,2015-11-20,45797524,Marc,Great location in the Beacon Hill neighborhood.  The apartment was clean and well stocked with the amenities we needed.  Will and his team were very responsive.  We would rent again!
9274587,58744332,2016-01-04,38581253,Valentine,"We spent a great week-end in Boston, the location of the apartment is perfect !"
only issues: the quality of the sofa bed was quite poor,"the cleaning was not made when we arrived (we went out for a ride to let the cleaning company prepare the apartment) and there was not enough cutlery for 4 people... but that was not an issue as we were only there for a week-end\"",,,,
9274587,68886229,2016-04-07,53085082,Victoria,"Great spot! I love this neighborhood. Lots of shops and good restaurants on Charles Street to enjoy. You really get the quintessential Boston experience. The bathroom heater was great for the cold days. My only suggestion is if you plan to use the pullout couch, you may want to bring an extra blanket."
9274587,72151109,2016-05-01,58101178,Emily,"The location was perfect.  Beacon Hill is such a charming neighborhood and centrally located.  Very close to the public garden and the commons, shops, restaurants, coffee, grocery and convenient stores.  We walked to the T station as well as the downtown and north end neighborhoods.  We couldn't have been more pleased.  Will was very accommodating and made sure a pack and play was waiting for us when we arrived with our son.  The newly renovated apartment was very nicely done.  The clean modern updates as well as the security of the building made us feel comfortable in this home away from home.  While the apartment isn't huge, the price point allows you to stay in a nice place in a great area.  If it had been just my husband and I without the little one, I don't even think it would have felt small.  I looked a lot beforehand and am so glad I found this apartment.  We would stay here again and recommend it."
9274587,82776270,2016-06-29,71958028,Leslie,Great location the apartment is as described and clean.  Be prepared if you have a car as parking may or may not be available and the garage down the street charges $42 per day.
9274587,85062695,2016-07-10,12225650,Tommy,"Couldn't imagine staying in a better location. The apartment was nice and cozy, and looked just as it does in the listing. Check in was easy with the codes, and we had no issues during our stay. The kitchen appliances all worked great and there are a few nice markets on the street where you can buy food to cook dinner. My only suggestion to other guests is to remember to bring your own shampoo and soap."
9274587,85881325,2016-07-13,20450560,Timothy,The location is great. Plenty of shops and restaurants just outside the door. Great for our purpose of exploring the history of Boston. The apartment was modern and clean. We enjoyed our stay.
9274587,90242645,2016-07-31,48007075,Camilla,"The Apartment is clean, comfortable and just the perfect size for a couple. The kitchen is fully equipped to make a lovely family meal, the living room area is spacious and the bathroom is a full size with a nice bathtab. Bedroom as two side wardrobe areas complimented by an additional large wardrobe in the entrance."
9274587,91471703,2016-08-05,32526158,Patrice,"Le condo était parfait pour notre séjour à Boston. Situé dans le quartier enchanteur de Beacon Hill, cet immeuble a été construit en 1860 et fait parti du régistre national des sites historiques!  Le tout était rénové au goût du jour et que dire du quartier: à quelques pas de petits cafés ainsi que du Boston Common.  Une station de métro était disponible à proximité quoique nous avons vraiment apprécié notre marche jusqu'au centre-ville (+/- 20 minutes).  En résumé, je recommande vraiment cet endroit."

It's located conveniently close to the bus station and to lots of restaurants and stores around! I had a great time staying with Chris (who is always so helpful and easily available. I had s great stay and yummy breakfast, and lots of fun with Mocha Joe :)"
7900936,45439373,2015-09-02,22064539,Eileen,"Chris was a welcoming host, very generous with her home. I hope to stay there again soon! The house is very convenient to Curry College."
7900936,45526269,2015-09-03,22064539,Eileen,"A very welcoming host, comfortable bed and airy screen room off the bedroom. Very close to Curry College."
7900936,45757744,2015-09-05,41398255,Chris,"This place was absolutely amazing! Chris was very friendly and welcoming! The room was spacious, the bed was comfortable and it led to a patio that was lit at night! The best part of staying here was the conversations over a DELICIOUS breakfast with Chris and cuddling with her cat, Mocha Jo. Chris also went out of her way to give us suggestions for dinner places and helped us get there! Furthermore, she had subway routes and bus schedules to make sure we could get around.  We would highly recommend this place to anyone!"
7900936,46199800,2015-09-08,6736235,Dylan,"Chris made us feel very welcome in her beautiful home, going out of the way to stick around so she could greet us in person when we arrived, made us breakfast each day, and was very helpful in suggesting how we could get into Boston (lots of street parking free on Sundays, thanks for the tip!). She is a kind and courteous host, and I would recommend her to anyone looking for a cozy room just outside Boston."
7900936,46554502,2015-09-11,5667658,Kate,"We got in at 1:30 in the morning and yet Chris was up and ready to welcome us. Her house was adorable and the room we were in was complete with its own little patio. Lovely all around, Chris, her home, and her handsome kitty. Highly recommend!!"
7900936,49672250,2015-10-05,38042045,Jessica,"Chris was the best host ever! From the minute I walked in her house I felt at home. Very cozy and comfortable bedroom with room access to her patio. Her house is full of fabulous art that she has made herself. Her kitty, Mocha Joe, is such a sweetie too and has the softest fur. The best part about the stay though, is Chris herself. She was very accommodating from the get go and very easy to get along with. The next morning she made a wonderful breakfast of German pancakes and fresh fruit. We had such great conversation and I truly made a friend here. Next time I travel to Boston, I won't stay anywhere else. Best airbnb experience I've had. Thanks Chris!"
7900936,50799554,2015-10-14,43406795,Magnus,Chris is a very good host and a nice person. The room was very nice and clean and have acess to a beutiful garden.

7900936,51236651,2015-10-18,44699842,Rob,"Chris was a very warm and welcoming host. She (and Mocha Joe) made me feel at home from the moment I walked through the door. Though my visit was short, we did have the chance to have nice chats in the evening and over breakfast. The bedroom was a very comfortable space, and the bed itself was just right for a good nights' sleep. I was in town for a business meeting, and this was a great place to stay - at a much more reasonable cost than area hotels."
7900936,51306094,2015-10-19,17414571,Linda,"Let me say this... if we lived next door to Chris, I could be best friends. Right from the moment we met, we felt welcomed and at home. She showed us our room and bathroom, gave us a key and said to make ourselves at home. Mocha Joe is a sweet, mellow cat that purred his 'hello'. The house and our room were better as advertised. Had it been warmer we would have spent time on our little deck. Chris' flair for color and style is everywhere, as are her beautiful watercolors and pastels. We have stayed in many B&B's but were only offered breakfast in one...until Morning Glory. Even though we were leaving early on Sunday morning, Chris made a wonderful breakfast - coffee, fruit, cider and a delicious German pancake with real maple syrup. I would return just to visit! Thank you so much Chris."
7900936,52020468,2015-10-25,34701164,Sara,"I'm so grateful Chris posted her available space. It was the perfect situation for getting ready for a wedding down the street, sleeping in a comfortable bed, and having a nice breakfast the next morning before we headed out. It was homey, clean, and comfortable for a fall weekend getaway. She provided us with maps if needed, a comfortable quiet space, and a delicious breakfast the next day. Thank you Chris for the affordable and comfortable stay!!!"

Firstly, Chris picked my friend and me up from the train station and drove us to her residence (and later drove us back to the train station). The room and bathroom were extremely quiet, comfortable, and private. Chris made sure that we had everything we needed and made us a delicious breakfast the following morning. I would recommend to anyone and would definitely stay there again myself!"
7900936,69145336,2016-04-09,43940195,Penne,"Chris was a terrific and friendly host. She went out of her way to make me feel welcome, even taking me to a shop so I could be prepared for a workshop I was attending locally."

7900936,71757641,2016-04-28,3601051,Hilary,Chris is the most welcoming hostess that you could possibly imagine and she made my stay a real pleasure. It was right at the end of a long trip and she helped me make the most of my short time in Boston as well as offering  extra arrangements that made it all very easy for me.
Her house is a delight of colour,light and comfort. Bedroom,bathroom and kitchen all on the ground floor all very conveniently designed and the cooking and facilities are generous. The surroundings are peaceful with local transport that takes less than 20 minutes to the centre.,,,
"Morning Glory is a very special place to stay. \"",,,,,

Her house is by train, inclusive walking to the train station around 20min far from the center of Boston, pretty close. The neighborhood was safe and quiet. The room was beautiful put together, comfy and clean. So was the bathroom and kitchen. The breakfast was tasty. Chris was so nice and made our stay in Boston perfect, thank you again!"
7900936,76654324,2016-05-28,45949819,Jenn-Yang,"Chris is a very hospitality host and we really enjoy the journey during Boston travel. The house contains deck chair, a yard with green gross and a very cute cat called MockJ will play with you and very friendly. It's almost like live in the dreams!! If any opportunity back to Boston again, I will have no hesitate booking Chris's house anymore.  Sincere;y recommendation :)"

From the time we expressed interest in booking, prior to arrival and during our entire visit. She was warm and friendly, and easy to get along with. Her house is beautiful, the  room is perfect with a private deck. It is quiet, and we heard only birds in the morning. Chris is a really sweet person, and we  enjoyed getting to know her. We are looking forward to renting from her again when we return to Boston."

The room was comfortable and nicely decorated. Mocha J is a adorable cat and he came to visit us quite often, my daughter loved him. The neighborhood was very quite and we felt safe in the area. The drive to Downtown Boston was about 30 minutes with traffic. Chris was very friendly and made us feel welcomed. Thank you Chris!"

We felt like living a dream and we want  to repeat our trip. Thank you for everything, we will never forget your American breakfast that you cooked for us, it was a  very good detail!!!"
7900936,91420847,2016-08-05,2564341,Noori,Our host Chris and our co-host Mocha Joe were absolutely amazing. I needed a peaceful home away from home while in Boston and her place totally surpassed our expectations.
During our stay,she made sure we had everything we needed from amenities to great conversation and her home was warm,inviting and tastefully adorned w/ her beautiful artwork.,,,
I'm going to miss watching the birds,squirrels and chipmunks blissfully playing outside in the yard,"I'm looking for another excuse to go back to Bean Town and would highly recommend her place in a heartbeat!\"",,,
7900936,92335309,2016-08-08,87705380,Kayla,"This was my first bnb experience and truthfully I was a little bit nervous; but the moment I met Chris and Mocha Joe that nervousness went away! If you visit Boston I highly advise you to book with Chris; you'll be staying in such a comfortable space with a very welcoming enviroment. The backyard is quiet and relaxing. We unfortunately only got to spend one night here but no matter the amount of time you're there, you'll feel right at home! Thank you Chris and Mocha Joe for being the best hosts possible!"
7900936,98121807,2016-08-29,82532720,Kim,Chris is a wonderful Host!  I started with me being hopelessly lost.  She talked me all the way to her driveway and was waiting outside for me.  She was warm and welcoming from the start.  We had some great dinners together with fantastic conversation.  She helped me with directions for any place I wanted to go.  She was always interested to hear about my day's adventures.  The neighborhood was typical suburbia and was very safe.  Chris' home instantly felt like home for me and I could easily relax.  My Boston home away from home.

I guess not everybody would have accepted us because we (family with two kids, 4yr & 2yrs) inquired our stay over airbnb just a couple of hours before arriving to Boston late in the evening. But hey, Suzy made everyting possible. Even more, she organized some food and toys for the kids but also maps and advices were prepared for things to do in Boston with kids. Also the appartment was super clean and many details prepared for the guests convenience. We really felt very welcome to this place - I mean Suzy is really a person you can trust to take care on your needs and your convenience. Thank you Suzy for the unforgettable opportunity!"

Suzy was easy to get ahold of and answered any and all questions I sent her way; she accommodated my requests above and beyond. Her place is comfy and warm, it housed three people with no problem and even being in a very popular and busy part of Boston was very quiet and let us rest after long days exploring the town. The area is amazing, so much culture and food to experience within a 5-10 minute walk. If you love Italian food this is a perfect place to stay. Transportation was also easily within walking distance and let us jet around the whole town. I would not hesitate to recommend Suzy's place for anyone looking to visit Boston and I can't wait to visit again."
1758953,13328756,2014-05-25,12458966,Cassandra,"Aside from Suzy being a stellar host, the location of her apartment is fantastic for a brief or long visit to Boston! Walking distance to many bars and restaurants as well as downtown and the subway. The apartment is well stocked with all the necessities (and a pastry or two for one of the local shops if you were as lucky as we were)!"

1758953,13835979,2014-06-05,6484920,Alex,The host is super nice. Apt is located at a very central area in North End. Apt is well designed. Highly recommended.
1758953,14005493,2014-06-09,8208267,Robert,Suzy was a great host. She provided clear and concise directions before my arrival and the space was very clean. In addition she provided great recommendations for where to go and what to see in the area. She's also responsive and easy-going.
As Suzy points out in her listing,the space is nearly completely renovated (mostly just a few ceiling spots,so just FYI. The place was still very cozy and warm. I'd stay again for sure. Plus the North End is an AMAZING location,so extra points there.,,
Thanks Suzy!,,,,,

1758953,18371224,2014-08-25,20148195,Cort,"Suzy is very nice, very responsive. Her place is in a great location, in the heart of little Italy. Her place was (URL HIDDEN) being renovated, the ceilings aren't done yet, the kitchen is small, and there is no television. Personally, airbnb was a bit out of my comfort zone, so I'll be sticking with hotels in the future.  It's a great spot for some young ppl looking to experience city life..not great for older folks, as it's up a few steep flights of stairs."

We really enjoyed staying at this place, it was exactly as described, very clean, and most important , is right in the middle of everything, lots of places are walking distance, restaurants, shops, museums, and other important historical sites along the freedom trail.  Metro station and the wharf where all the tours depart was about 10 minute walk.  we will conme back and stay here on out next trip."

The check-in process was very simple with Suzy's instruction. She prepared everything we need in the apartment, even some snacks and a bottle of wine! In addition, Suzy wrote us a detailed Boston trip guide with maps. It made our Boston trip out of expectation."
Then,the apartment itself. It is a very cute and comfortable condo,very well designed and decorated and clean. The bed is very cozy. You can find all kitchen utensils easily. Everything is very well organized.,,,
Third,the LOCATION! The apartment locates in probably the best place in Boston! It lies in a very quite neighborhood,while all great restaurants and bars and cafes are within walking distance. We felt pretty safe walking around even in late night. It is also close to subway stations,commuter rail stations and airport. Very convenient.,,

"Suzy was a very gracious host. This was my wife and I's first time using Airbnb and the experience could not have been better.  Suzy was more responsive via email than most of my co-workers.  Her directions and recommendations were accurate and well thought out.  I highly recommend using Suzy as an Airbnb host.\"",,,,,

It was quiet, clean and a great location.  The bed was very comfortable and the living space was cozy.   I would recommend this apartment for no more than  one - two people."
1758953,30906638,2015-04-28,26282143,Annelis,We loved Suzy's apartment! It was clean and nice and she made us feel very welcome.
The place is cute and not too big,but could easily fit 2 adults and our baby,and the pictures are very realistic.,,,
There is limited kitchen equipment although enough to cook a full meal,and also no dining table,but who needs it in the middle of Little Italy with tons of great restaurants and take out places,we used that a lot!,,
The location is perfect! A lot of people in the streets at night for a great atmosphere and to make you feel safe,but at the same time the apartment is located a street away from everything so the place was completely silent both during day and night.,,,,
"Also Suzy is really responsive and does all she can to help out. This place gets our highest recommendation!\"",,,,,

It was quiet and the bed was comfortable.  Suzy was very helpful.  Thanks!  We enjoyed our visit to Boston."

1758953,35126398,2015-06-15,33989178,Kassie,"\"Suzy's place was the perfect \"\"home base\"\" for exploring the North End and beyond"
The Freedom Trail was very interesting and informative; felt great to be where everything was happening back then.  There's a great sports bar around the corner - we were able to watch the Warriors' NBA Finals game there on Sunday; wish we had known when we arrived on Thursday that that place was there.  I was only able to keep track of the Warriors' game that night with written updates from the NBA website on my cellphone (no TV reception at Suzy's place).  (Can you tell I am originally from Oakland,CA?),,,,
Be sure to do the New England Aquarium Whale Watching tour.  It was awesome and a definite highlight of our week!  We also got to take in a Red Sox game.  As a baseball fan,it was cool to experience Fenway Park.,,,,
As others have said,you can't go wrong at any of the Italian restaurants in the North End,and be sure to check out the oldest taverns along the Freedom Trail - we hit Green Dragon Tavern and Bell in Hand Tavern and that was fun.  And be sure to go to Mike's Pastry for cannoli - it's worth waiting in the line that is always there (it moves quickly).,,,
Yes,Suzy's place is very tiny,"but it works when you're spending almost all of your time exploring and not \"\"cooking in\"\".  Note that there is no place to sit down to eat a meal.  We had restaurant leftovers one night",and ate sitting on the couch with plates on our laps.,,
All in all,we had an awesome stay in Boston,and having Suzy's place as our home base for our first 4 days really made it work well.  My only other comment is that Boston is a really expensive place to be,"so be prepared for that!\"",,

The apartment is very well located in the North End, but is enough off the beaten path so it's not noisy. We were within easy walking distance to many wonderful eateries. I'd personally recommend Trattoria di Monica and Terramia. Both places are very small (I'd definitely suggest a reservation) and the food very interesting. The apartment was also within reasonable walking distance to the Haymarket T stop."
Suzy was very responsive to our original inquiry and any subsequent questions. The apartment is simply furnished but had all the essentials covered for our 3 day stay. It was clean and the bed,although on the floor,"was really comfortable. Thanks for sharing your place with us Suzy!\"",,,

The cute condo is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood and is just minutes away from many of Boston's best restaurants. I stayed at this place for about 2 months and Suzy had tried to make my stay as convenient as possible. She always responded to my texts within minutes and tried her best to resolve any issues as quick as possible. Thank you so much and I will definitely miss the condo!

Suzy was very helpful and responsive. A great place to stay."
1758953,70670791,2016-04-19,4610277,Chris And Megan,"We had a mixed experience staying at Suzy's North End. While we loved the location, the apartment was quiet and Suzy was really responsive we were slightly disappointed with the accommodations. I know she mentioned that the place is artsy with exposed wiring but we were not expecting there to be slats of wood in the corner for construction, outlets falling out of the wall, blinds falling when we pulled them down and lights hanging from the ceiling. Also we felt that the overall cleanliness of the unit was not very good. The shower was moldy and clogged and there was quite a lot of clutter in the apartment just laying around. Also the bedding was limited, pillows were quite uncomfortable and we didn't have enough pillow cases. Also we were surprised there was no coffee maker or kettle for the unit. I would also recommend another method for leaving the keys. When we were trying to pull down the mailboxes for all five of the units in the building another tenant questioned what we were doing there since the building doesn't allow airbnb rentals. It was pretty difficult to fish the keys out of a shared mailbox."

She reached out after booking, about a week before the trip with instructions on how to access her place, the day of to make sure I got in okay, and a day before leaving. She was available via text which was convenient. The listing description was accurate and better than expected! Suzy’s home was cozy and bright. There was enough closet space for hanging clothes. The kitchen had the essentials for our snacks and reheating leftovers. Suzy did not have a microwave, granted I did not need this but something to take note of if you're not reheating your pizza/pasta on the stove (which you should!). The neighborhood was perfect and very walk-able. This probably helped reduce weight gain from all the delicious food choices Boston has. The location of the home made the trip very authentic! I would definitely reconsider staying at this location again if visiting Boston."

We never met but she answered all of my questions by message almost immediately, including recommending some local restaurants. The best thing about the place is the location. The neighborhood is really charming, and there is lots to do within a short walking distance. The apartment itself is small and homey. The aesthetic is nice, but there is an unfinished quality to some of the construction.  You could see this as part of the funky charm of the place. I did not mind it, but some might. There is a nice little kitchen, but no place to dine, really. The separate bedroom was a nice size for a studio sized apartment. There is also evidence of someone currently living there, so there is a house-sitting feel to the experience. I don't mind any of that, so I felt very at home there."

It was an easy walk from the Aquarium T station, a couple minutes' walk from yummy Little Italy bakeries (hello Mike's and Bova's!) and restaurants, yet very quiet. We'd stay again!"
1758953,78718969,2016-06-08,32160007,Bill,Great location.  Great communication with Suzy.  Enjoyed the accommodations and would definitely stay again.
1758953,79445199,2016-06-12,23582417,Jessica,"Everything was great! Suzy was VERY responsive from the beginning and made the check in/out process simple. We loved the location: very convenient to a lot of restaurants, bakeries, shops, and an easy walk into the downtown area and a few of the bike share stations which we used to explore the riverfront, the areas around Harvard, Fenway, etc. The space itself, while not super big, was perfect for what we needed and very comfortable."

Very interesting and creative updates to ceilings that should look great once they are completed.,,,,,
A good choice if you are wanting to visit the North End-Little Italy.,,,,,

The apartment was exactly what we expected and it was very nice and clean.  We loved the location - it was right in the North End and easily accessible to downtown Boston.  This was our first time using AirBnB and we were a little nervous but it was a great experience.  Thanks!!"

The apartment is very cute and ideally located with all the highlights of Boston a quick walk or uber away. Didnt get to cycle on this visit, but I'll be sure to make time on my next trip."
There's so much to see near here. The food is amazing and you're very close to the water/boardwalk as well.,,,,,
The bed is very comfy,and plenty of pillows was a plus too. Summertime visit,"AC was a major plus also. Look forward to planning another stay here in the future :-)\"",,,

Not even a block from the North Church and so many great Italian bakeries. If you want to visit the North End this is the only place to stay! Can't wait to come back. Suzy was an incredible host offering all kinds of suggestions and you can tell she really loves the neighborhood."

1758953,98419782,2016-08-30,37045254,Chris,"We loved Panagioti and Suzy's place! It was wonderfully located, close to everything on The North End. The apartment was compfy with a great couch and and a comfortable bed. Loved the ceiling in the bedroom! The neighborhood was safe and about a block from a 7-11. More importantly though.... it's about 4 blocks from the Canoli heaven at Mike's Pastries and Modern Pastries."

He is an excellent host, friendly and warm. His apartment is very well done and is exactly like it looks in pictures. He made my stay very comfortable."
1899770,54200880,2015-11-16,17866593,Augusta,Samuel was very quick to respond and extremely accessible throughout our planning and also during the weekend. The apartment is beautiful and cozy with anything you could need! We had a wonderful stay and look forward to recommending this South End gem to friends.
1899770,64981249,2016-03-09,8473390,Tejas,"I booked with Samuel less than 24 hour from arriving for a last minute business trip. Samuel responded quickly after accepting my request to stay, and was available to be home when I arrived. The apartment room was clean and ready when I arrived. Samuel also provided me with directions to public transport, and I quickly learned that South End was a very accessible place to stay."
1899770,68252441,2016-04-03,22772587,Thomas,"Really nice place, and Samuel was very friendly. Convenient location. I basically had the whole apartment to myself most of the time."

1899770,70934083,2016-04-22,25773248,Lesley,"Samuel was very kind and accessible, willing to return quickly should I need help with something.  The apartment was lovely,very clean  and quiet, always a gift and a surprise! The South End was a great place to stay -- an easy walk from the Back Bay Station and buses to downtown Boston and Cambridge. A wonderful visit -- sorry it was so short!"
8947232,51837674,2015-10-24,34291767,Tuncay,The room was exactly as shown. There is a park just in front of house. It is very quite place. Marie was very relevent. She called and asked whether I need someting or not. She helped quickly when I need. I extended my stay one more week. Thanks Marie.
8947232,61273791,2016-02-01,28936463,Altino,"I had a Really nice stay, my bed was super comfortable, the room very cozy with the heater working great. Marie, the host, is super friendly. Her place is very clean, and she kept texting me every single morning, during my stay, to check on me and wondering if I needed anything."
8947232,68023954,2016-04-01,59644953,Neil,House was clean and tidy. Marie was nice. Thanks for the stay.
8947232,69832077,2016-04-14,33205747,Christopher,"Marie made me feel very welcome, she met me at the house when it was convenient for me, gave me a tour, let me know where everything was. The room is shared with another AirBnB guest (long-term) and Marie rents the upstairs room to some students. The house has everything you might need, and it in a nice neighborhood right near the red line. For me, I did have a difficult time with some of the noise. The heater is a little loud, and the upstairs students were constantly talking and making noise past midnight, the walls are very thin. It was hard to get a good night sleep. I have to say though, Marie was very good about responding to my complaints and asking the other tenants to keep it down. She did her best to make my stay comfortable, but I am a very light sleeper so it was difficult for me. I had to use ear plugs and a white noise maker on my phone, and it was hard to find quiet time to meditate or do yoga."
In short,the place is great in lots of ways,but if you're sensitive to noise,"you might have a hard time. \"",,
8947232,73077381,2016-05-06,68541355,Srinath,Marie is a wonderful host. She is extremely nice and makes sure that you are safe and happy at her house. She made sure I had all the necessary things and was always reachable by text. She picked me up from the station and I don't imagine any other host doing it. I would surely recommend her house for stay.
8947232,90588422,2016-08-01,81871592,Ali,"Marie is very nice host and helpful, thank you for hosting me."
12067685,70605848,2016-04-18,33247620,Wendy,"This apartment is in a great location near Tufts Medical Center, close to the orange line.  We were able to walk to the Boylston or Park green T line too.  It is also close to Chinatown and walkable to the Boston Common (less than a mile).  We stayed here to do college touring.  The steps to the apartment are narrow but like Katerina mentioned you will need to be able to carry your luggage up 3 flights of stairs.  Communication could have been a little better as far as how to get into the apartment, wifi access, hot water (takes a long time to get hot), and how to turn the heater down.  (We were told on our last day we cannot.)    Katerina was out of the country so we could not get immediate answers and her friend Laura did help us.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for Laura to let us into the apartment.  When we got there it was stuffy and smelled like curry.  There was also leftover food bits in the kitchen sink drain and the oven contained two dirty pans so I did not feel comfortable using the oven.  There was a microwave so we were able to heat up our cinnamon roll that we bought at Panera Bread which is about 5 blocks away.  The bed and apartment was clean overall and the sheets were nice and soft.  The bathroom is a little funky.  If you are not too picky and want a reasonable place to stay and if this location is where you want to be then you can stay here.  Since we were the first airbnb guests Katerina ever had I'm sure she can improve on the dirty sink and pans and I don't think that would happen again.  The apartment did have windows that opened to let in the fresh air and to try to air out the curry smell.  Katerina was flexible in letting us leave our luggage at the apartment before our flight in the afternoon and seemed like a very nice person."
12067685,75797018,2016-05-23,71826948,Brian,Katerina was a great host.  Went out of her way to accommodate our schedule and needing to check in early.  Place was clean and in a great location.
4089940,20925631,2014-10-07,1106221,Kurt,"We loved this 1 bedroom right in the heart of Boston's North End.  We were a few steps away from Harrison street where all of the great Italian restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops were.  It was also an easy location to walk to various other neighborhoods with Boston.  The apartment was clean, spacious, and quiet.  The only thing to be aware of is that the apartment is on the 4th floor and you have to walk up a steep stairway.  For most people this may not be an issue, but it's good to know if you may have issues with walking up and down stairs on a regular basis."
4089940,22496821,2014-11-08,9064603,Tom,The Studio apartment was beautifully clean and had everything we needed including some snacks and coffee to get us started.  The decor was lovely and modern and appliances new.   The apartment was on two levels so it gave the impression of being two rooms instead of one.  I would say it was perfect for a couple.
4089940,22969661,2014-11-18,21286068,Risa,"The apartment is beautiful and very comfortable. Everything was great. We had a problem with the heat, and the company was very gracious and got it fixed as soon as possible, even on Friday night. The location is fantastic. Overall we had a great time and the apartment made the trip!"
4089940,29125141,2015-04-04,11135105,Yasaman,"The apartment was in a great and safe area in the North end, surrounded by wonderful restaurants. It was exactly as pictured, but I was surprised how big the apartment was compared to what it looked like in the pictures. Very clean. Towels were extra fluffy, which was nice! Would book again."
4089940,29938880,2015-04-14,3517897,Robbert,The apartment is very spacious and clean and the response times were really good when the Internet didn't seem to work. Overall a very good experience.
4089940,30579690,2015-04-24,24459159,Greg,"The apartment is a top floor quiet location.  You cannot hear the neighbors and is perfectly situated in the North End.  Step outside and you are in some of the oldest parts of the city and finest restaurants with small town appeal.  Walking downtown is easy, approximately a 10 min walk to the Financial District and other beautiful parts of the city."
Comfortable,clean,"home-like feel in nature; this place is outstanding.  I'll be back!\"",,,
4089940,31364173,2015-05-04,28364757,Irene,We didn't meet Adam but that was not a problem. The apartment was perfect as was the location. I had been to Boston before so I had a very good idea where the apartment would be and was not disappointed.
"The only issue is that the apartment is in a walk-up - fourth floor. Not a problem for most but it did impact on the amount of luggage we brought - we were only there for 4 days so not a big issue. First time with airbnb and will certainly use again.\"",,,,,
4089940,32364366,2015-05-17,660608,Mike,"Great location.  Easily walkable to all the tourist locations such as Quincy Market, Boston Harbor, Freedom Trail.  Also within walking distance to Neptune Oyster restaurant which you must go to for the best lobster rolls and fresh shucked oysters."
For areas not within walking distance,we used Uber or Lyft.  We didn't bother renting a car since parking can be difficult to find.,,,,
"The only negative was that sleeping in was a bit difficult since there always seem to be construction noise in the neighborhood. \"",,,,,
4089940,32835421,2015-05-22,31041946,Sean,Booking process was super easy and Adam was really easy responsive. The agent used for check in made it very easy and it only took us a couple of minutes to gain access to the apartment. Amazing area with some of the best Italian restaurants and moments away from the key freedom trail highlights. Appartment was clean and extremely comfortable - would definitely return.
4089940,33512596,2015-05-29,30683204,Kyuree,"Adam was very helpful and responsive. The place was just like the pictures. I was visiting boston on a business trip and found this place perfect. Adam was kind enough to have some snack, water and coffee for our first day. I also asked for an air mattress which were ready for us upon arrival. Overall a very enjoyable stay would recommend!"
The only thing was that i was informed that the place was on the 4th floor,but it was actually on the 2nd floor. We were sorry to have disturbed the neighbors upstairs by trying to open their doors with our keys,but they were very kind in understanding.  One last tip,dont leave your luggage unattended infront of the doorsteps. (Which is very obvious but still). We left our luggage infront of the main entrance,and while we went upstairs to bring down our other stuff (which took like 2 minutes),our suitcases were gone. We caught a random man living just around the corner right as he was taking our luggage inside his house
4089940,35093360,2015-06-15,29709225,Matt,"Great experience. Place is in a great location and check in was really easy. The north end is fantastic and this place is close to everything, with quick stroll to subway and buses. Would definitely go back"
4089940,35667163,2015-06-21,30945294,Karl,"An email with clear instructions was provided in advance, so moving in went smoothly.  The apartment was as described and very comfortable. The neighborhood was charming. I would gladly stay there again when visiting Boston."

4089940,40496284,2015-07-31,7839001,Lisa,"Totally in love with the North End.  I was there for work but loved coming home to a cozy neighborhood.  If you are looking for the experience of actually living in Boston, this is a great place to do so.  All of the conveniences of home."
The 5 flight hoof up was a great way of working off all of the pasta and butter cookies.  Being that high up,you didn't get a lot of noise.  Location is the northside of the North End so not to many tourists make it down to the area and you are mingling more with the local residents.,,,,
Uber and walking were my primary mode of transportation.  Everything is reasonably accessible by walking.,,,,,
"Will come back here and stay again!!\"",,,,,
4089940,42193889,2015-08-11,34637619,Sijia,"It was a great living experience. Lots of great Italian restaurants, 711 is just two minuets walk away. Italian festival at the weekend. The apt is spacious and well equipped. Can't find a better choice in north end ."

4089940,45401209,2015-09-02,4584573,Aurelie,"The apartment is very well located - it takes no more than 5min to get to the subway and you are at the heart of the italian village, right in the middle of the freedom trail! despite all the (great) activities going around, we had very restful nights (quiet street)."
We got in the appartment very easily (the compass system is very reliable and easy) and we absolutely enjoyed our stay.,,,,,

On arrival everything was well set up even with some snacks that we happily saw through.  I would recommend this site for first timers in Boston as everything is at walking distance"
4089940,47767364,2015-09-21,14062158,Tracy,"The location is AMAZING. One block from the bay, one block from the main street in the Little Italy area. Walking distance from almost everything else."
4089940,48913980,2015-09-29,6919375,Danielle,"Perfect location, clean and well-equipped apartment, comfortable bed. The downsides are the 4 flights of stairs if you have a lot of luggage, and that you have to do a thorough clean-up yourself or pay $150 (which I didn't realize!). Also, some street noise, especially because the AC is installed in the windows, so they are constantly open."
4089940,49535219,2015-10-04,35180136,Anjelica,"This location was spectacular! Adam was quick to respond, very helpful with questions, and gave clear direction. Our entry to the apartment was incredibly easy and the accommodation was well-equipped, clean and spacious, and in a prime location to restaurants, attractions, and public transportation. I would be thrilled to stay again."
4089940,50316628,2015-10-11,43647239,Ben,"We recently stayed in Adam's 1 bedroom apartment in Boston's North End, and loved it. It was centrally located in a great neighborhood. We went for many walks and explored the rich character of the area. Having a clean and very comfortable apartment to come back to at the end of the day really made the trip a success. If you stay here, you will love it."
Move in was super easy. We received a reminder email with instructions before arriving,and again just before leaving. It was very clear what the procedure was,"which made the process easy. \"",,,

Overall my girlfriend and I loved the apartment and would recommend it to our family and close friends.  Two thumbs up!
4089940,61787757,2016-02-08,54073167,Gary,"\""
The apartment was great and very accurately described. Adam was very up-front about the fact that the actual apartment that we rented was on the 5th floor and that there was no lift available...However it was worth the regular climb and with all of the fantastic restaurants nearby...we needed the exercise! Upon arrival we had a couple of very minor requests but these were very efficiently dealt with,so in short,"I would have no hesitation in recommending both Adam and the apartment.\"",,,
4089940,68446538,2016-04-05,45974012,Tim,"The apartment was just as described and shown in photos. Included all the mod cons you'd ever need, great location in walking distance to explore the city or hop on the subway, comfortable, modern, clean and large! Adam was very helpful and I can definitely recommend."
4089940,69647422,2016-04-12,61160834,Sheena,Amazing location! Walking distance to all the great dining and freedom trail. Very clean and spacious. Host was very accommodating to check ins/outs. Loved it!
4089940,75687237,2016-05-22,49586487,Arienne,"This apartment was just as described.  It was clean, cozy, and in a perfect location!  It was so close to the excitement of North End, and an easy walk to several exciting spots on the Freedom Trail.  The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed, and the living room and bedroom was cozy and the perfect place to relax after seeing the sites.  The only issue we had was the check in - our keys were not available in the lock box as described (and the envelope for moving out was missing as well).  However the office was easy to get a hold of and got us access to keys quickly."
4089940,78255835,2016-06-06,18453129,Brian,"Easy welcome, to the friendliest neighborhood!"
4089940,80833167,2016-06-20,27382170,Michelle,"It was a pleasant experience staying at Adam's apartment. The location was very nice, since the apartment was 5 min walk to Mike's pastry and 10 min walk to Quincy Market. Our only wish is the bathroom can be larger."
4089940,82258576,2016-06-27,51538271,Sandy,Everything was exactly how we thought it would be.  The key was left in the box with our name on it and we found it easily.  The apartment was comfortable and nicely decorated.  We had everything we needed.  The neighborhood was perfect for us!  Right in the middle of the Italian district.  I think we both put on 20 pounds!  LOL!
4089940,85083371,2016-07-10,28556674,Jack,"Adam's place is one of the best I've stayed in over the last year.  It's very clean, modern, very well located and quiet.  I highly recommend it.  The only thing to be aware of is there is a three flight walk up.  If you have an issue with stairs, you may want to look elsewhere.  I didn't find it to be an issue at all."

If I return to Boston, it's sure that I will return to this place. At 3 min walk to the metro is very convenient!"
Mon copain et moi avons passé 4 nuits chez Hermina. Nous avons été très bien reçu ! Notre chambre était tres bien et très grande,de plus c'est une incroyable hôte ! Si je retourne sur Boston,c'est certain que je vais retourner à cet endroit. À 3 min à pieds du métro,c'est très pratique !,,

47521,95475,2010-09-12,219149,Victoria,"Hermina is a consummate hostess, she arranged for our visit to her home at a time when she herself had to fly back unexpectedly to Armenia. The house had free street parking and is very convenient to the red line metro. It should be perhaps noted that Dorchester isn’t Boston’s most salubrious neighbourhood and the house is next to a police station with the attendant noise from the sirens, this could influence travellers with small children."
47521,98470,2010-09-16,217225,Danielle&Karl,"Unfortunately Hermina wasn't able to be at her house while we were there, but she made arrangements with a friend / neighbour to let us in."
We had the downstairs (basement) room which was pretty big and clean. It had it's own secure entrance and it's own mini kitchen.,,,,,
The room was a little dark but the bathroom (shared) was good.,,,,,
"The area the house was in was a little drab with not much going on but access into central Boston was only a 20 minute journey by the \"\"T\"\".",,,,,
"Overall the accommodation was pretty much all we needed.\"",,,,,
47521,105783,2010-09-26,240500,Laurie,Hermina est très accueillante et son logement au sous-sol est parfait pour un couple qui veut garder son intimité. Je le recommande à tous!!
47521,110134,2010-10-02,239323,Dawn,I had a wonderful visit and will stay there again when I return to Boston.  There was easy free parking and easy access to the T.  Hermina is charming and helpful and she took time to take me to castle island for a walk.  It felt like a bit of Europe in Boston.  THANKS AGAIN :-)
47521,111599,2010-10-04,8966,Enrico,It was a short overnight stay but it was the most comfortable ever. Hermina and I didn't really had the chance to bond but we were able to chat a bit before we left to go around Boston. Very sweet! Very well recommended! Nice room! Very clean sheets and very clean bathroom! Accessible to the T! Safe area! :)
47521,114762,2010-10-09,224720,Muriel,"Beautiful house, Hermina is very nice and helpful, thank you!"
47521,115469,2010-10-10,238735,Greg,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was great! Though not on site, Hermina was a gracious hostess with a well stocked kitchen which she generously offered. I am a fan of airbnb and anticipate similar future experiences. I may use airbnb for business. This was a great value!"
47521,120689,2010-10-17,230755,Remy,"Hermina is a very sweet lady with a beautiful victorian home. The basement level which my friend and I stayed in was huge and included a bed, kitchen & electric oven top. It's a shared bathroom among other renters, but there was no real wait to use it. The room was clean, but make sure all of the sheets are clean as well. The bathroom did have a little malfunction from time to time, the lights/air vent/heater totally shut off twice and there is no window so it's pitch black. Make sure you have your cell phone or a few candles for back up. =P"
Though we didn't talk to Hermina throughout the trip (except getting there & leaving),she answered all my phone calls and was very attentive in helping us with a taxi from her house to the Logan airport on our last day. The Red Line subway is a quick walk (5-7min) and is around a 30min or so ride to the downtown areas.,,,,
As for the location of her house,the neighborhood reminded me of when I used to live around Oakland,(California - yes,"\"\"Oakland","smokin..\"\") so there was moments of uneasiness","especially since my friend and I look more like the \"\"younger crowd\"\" to be mistaken for trouble (NOTE: Do not wear a San Franciso Giants hat in Dorchester). There IS a very sweet brunch spot 10-15min walking distance called Dot2Dot"
I give this place 4 out of 5 because the location isn't all that great,but for the price & for the hospitality it is mighty worth it. Hermina is a very sweet & pleasant host!,,,,
"\"",,,,,
47521,123121,2010-10-20,225213,Bill,Hermina was pleasant and accommodating. She even lent us a hair dryer. My wife and I enjoyed the amount of space and seclusion of her day-light basement. It was just what we needed before flying out of Boston. The bathroom could have been cleaner. The neighborhood is sad BUT the house is right across the street from the Vietnamese Buddhist center with a wonderful incense filled garden dominated by a white marble Quan Yin statue.
47521,126613,2010-10-25,246239,Duane,Hermina was away but made sure that I had access to the house.
This was my first time renting a room from a stranger. I typically do not sleep well when I travel,so I find expensive hotels a great waste of money. This was a great alternative. The room was clean,as was the house. The bed was comfortable and the house was a very short walk from the T.,,,
I would return here again,"although I would bring ear plugs. You will hear other people in the house (not unexpected) or the police station next door. I tend to be a light sleeper.\"",,,,
47521,129831,2010-10-30,250905,Paul,"Excellent value. Clean, convenient location for subway but no hassle if with a car."
"Hermina is a very nice host. A far more friendly experience than in a typical B&B.\"",,,,,
47521,172633,2011-01-19,22491,Bill,"I couldn't have asked for a better stay for my needs. Herminea was very flexible and accommodating. There IS plenty of street parking, but much less in the snowy New England winters. You may have to make a bit of an effort to find a space in a winter like this one."
"Coming to Beantown?  Stay at Herminea's. \"",,,,,
47521,220095,2011-04-07,478195,Betty,She is a great host would definitely stay there again
47521,224933,2011-04-12,26795,Rebecca,"Hermina was a lovely, warm host. We came in very late in the evening with only a day or two of warning--1AM, and she was awake to greet us and to show us her place. The accommodations were very comfortable and spacious. Her home is also very beautiful with vibrant colors on the inside. Another plus-very close to public transit--about a 5-minute walk or less to the Red Line, which takes you through downtown to cambridge area and beyond. Thank you, Hermina!"
47521,228237,2011-04-16,458388,Falko,"Herminias place was the perfect accommodation. Very big and beatiful house with a whole floor just for us. Herminia herself was very helpful and friendly.although she wasn't at home for the most time, she helped us with many different things. We enjoyed it very much."
47521,232960,2011-04-20,392875,Kristy,Very convenient to the T.  Great hostess!
47521,270709,2011-05-19,487791,Kerri,"Had a great time be sure to specify which place you're staying in-once my friends and I got into the studio we were totally delighted, and we enjoyed each of the other rooms on our way down there!  Hermina is a gracious and hospitable woman, a joy to stay with."
47521,286262,2011-05-29,97683,Ed,A nice place to stay with a very accommodating and helpful host. Access to the Subway is a 5 minute walk with a direct link to the city centre.
"Parking is on the street and is free.\"",,,,,
47521,294854,2011-06-02,587609,Olga,I enjoyed my stay at Hermina's house. The room nice and comfortable.
The train connection to Boston metro area was great. The host was very nice,helpful and hospitable.,,,,
"Olga\"",,,,,
47521,308229,2011-06-11,600087,Alison,"Hermina is a wonderful host, and it really is like staying with a friend. She is 100% relaxed and generous: letting us share food from the fridge, borrow her GPS, even giving up her own room. A perfect stay!"
47521,335304,2011-06-26,589129,Evelyn,"I had a wonderful stay in Boston the two days I stayed at Hermina's. It is very convenient to get to and there are shops nearby in case you forgot anything at home. The room I had was very homey and comfortable. If I were to return to the Boston area, I would definitely stay with Herminia again. It was quite fun getting to know her and the other guests as well. There are nearby places to eat that are very reasonable and it's quite easy to get around from her place by the Metro. She made it easy to arrive without her having to be actually present(URL HIDDEN)"
47521,366328,2011-07-11,671850,Davide&Valentina,The room we slept in had two windows which provided a good airing and cooling of the space and a closet all for us; it was small but comfortable. We also had towels and bed linen provided.
The house is big,with a lot of light and spaces for cooking,eating or relax. The bathroom is clean.,,,
The surroundings have many services and,even if it's not the best neighborhood in Boston,we felt safe and fulfilled in our needs: the house is pretty much in the police station's yard and in a two minutes walk you are at the metro station.,,,
"Hermina is very convivial and helpful.\"",,,,,
47521,419767,2011-08-04,78182,Cara,"Hermina was a wonderful hostess, and has a lovely home! We took the advice of another guest of hers to call ahead and ask which room we should stay in. The room was HUGE - two sofas to lounge on! We were made to feel just so welcome - she means it when she says make yourself at home."
47521,424701,2011-08-06,191496,Matthias,I had a very nice stay with Hermina. Her house is located really close to the T making it a real good starting point for city tours. The common areas were really clean and the fridge full with plenty of things to eat.
"I can highly recommend staying with her!\"",,,,,
47521,431983,2011-08-09,796369,Jungeun,"We had a good time in Boston thanks for Hermina. She is really nice and helped us a lot. The room was big and really comfortable to stay. Hermina's house is close to metro so it was convenient to go anywhere we want. If I go to Boston next time, I want to stay there again!"
47521,436412,2011-08-11,723267,Pierre,"Nous avons été très déçus par cette adresse : chambre minuscule où il était difficile d'ouvrir deux valises en même temps salle de bain pas nette du tout, ressources pour le petit déjeuner très banales ! Bref nous en sommes partis sans regret, rien à  voir avec les autres adresses Airbnb ! Le tout pour plus de 70 dollars ! A rayer de son carnet d'adresse"
47521,454733,2011-08-17,12456,Valeria,"Hermina is an interesting person, very nice and easy going. The house is huge and close to the subway."
47521,464412,2011-08-21,996307,Jared,The host canceled my reservation the day before arrival.
47521,476707,2011-08-26,724620,Vikas,Enjoyed my return visit.  Hermina was as always a welcoming hostess.  Very convenient location near a T stop.  Would recommend to anyone looking for an at-home experience when traveling.
47521,509778,2011-09-06,970663,Len,"\"It seemed like my stay at Hermina's was just what I could have ordered: a less than 1-hour commute to/from Logan Airport on public transit (even on a Sunday); a pay-one-price access to unlimited rides on the \"\"T\"\" (as the local transit system is known"
47521,512220,2011-09-07,1093980,Kyle,"I only stayed one night; however, the house was nice, secure (always locked, stuff felt safe), community around the house is down to earth--I highly recommend the pizza place just down the street. House feels warm and homelike, the T is just a couple minute walk away and thus making where you stay central to anywhere you want to go!! Hermina was gone while I was there, but she put me in contact with her friend who was very kind and wanted to make sure I had a good time while there. One night is not enough to enjoy all that Boston has to offer, not by far... so I plan on coming back very soon and plan on making this where I will stay."
47521,545605,2011-09-19,942046,Anna,"Nice house, very close to subway station, easy to get to downtown. Great host, the room was comfortable, breakfast included. But it's a little bit cold there, don't forget your warm socks))"
47521,595587,2011-10-03,1222007,Brianna,"My friends and I had a great time staying with Hermina. She was a very kind and friendly host. The location was fantastic - less than a 5 minute walk to the T, then only about a 10 minute ride to downtown."

47521,641623,2011-10-18,1130471,George & Barbara,"Hermina was a gracious host.  The room was large and clean with a comfortable queen bed.   The house is next to the police parking lot so it is very safe and quiet.  The neighborhood is nothing to write home about, but it is only a block to the T and we spent all of our time in Boston central.  It was a convenient and affordable place to spend the night.  McDonald's, a market and liquor store are just around corner.  We didn't eat in neighborhood so no comment on food availability.    This was our first airbnb experience.  The shared bathroom was something we personally would avoid in the future.   I felt the room was a good value for Boston."
47521,651289,2011-10-21,1164899,Nicole,"Hermina was very warm and welcoming. She took me in stand by when my other accommodations didn't work out.  The townhouse is tucked in the back and off the street and borders a police station, so it is very safe. It was very conveniently located near the Fields Corner station on the red line. The room/house was very basic, but there is a full kitchen and Hermina had it stocked with basic breakfast items, coffee, tea. I met some really lovely people while staying there."

47521,674014,2011-10-29,1311717,Brian,"Hermina was an awesome host.  She was warm, kind, and welcoming, and her statement about being your best friend that you don't know yet is right on the mark.  She is always willing to chat with you in the evenings and offer tea and snacks.  There was even one night that she had some friends over for a dinner and invited me along.  It was a wonderful meal and she made me feel like I had known her for ages.  The room and bathroom were also very clean and well kept.  I highly recommend the place and would definitely stay there again if I'm ever in the area."
47521,700811,2011-11-07,1356675,Ane,Perfect location! The house is really nice.
47521,714739,2011-11-13,1352099,Mary,Her house was lovely! She welcomed me warmly! I just stayed there one night but I had a great tea time with her ;)
47521,721714,2011-11-15,1295798,Aini,Hermina was a great host. She was hospitable and very intellectual! Airbnb is also a good site for someone looking for lodging opportunities when traveling.
47521,742392,2011-11-24,1379082,Hugh,"This is a sub-divided house, with numerous guest rooms in the one building. It's really easy to get around the city, as the house is really close to a train station. And the room itself was quite large - your own TV, cupboard, sink, kettle and lots of room to sit around. Not sure about the other rooms in the house."
There is also a shared fridge,bathroom and laundry.,,,,
The room was very nice,but as we were on the basement level there was quite a lot of noise coming through the floorboards. We kept quite late hours so it never affected our sleep,"but if you are a light sleeper it could cause some problems.\"",,,
47521,893014,2012-01-30,1660543,Sharmini,"My friends and I only stayed over at Hermina's for one night, but it was great. She was really sweet and gave us extra blankets and provided us with clean towels. The room was clean and cozy and the bathroom was really clean too."

47521,1041906,2012-03-25,1974918,Sebastian,As this was my first time using AirBnB I didn´t know what to expect.
The small room in the house was alright,Hermina put in an additional matress,to accomodate the both of us. The House was clean,Hermina made us a small breakfast,and all was fine. The close proximity to FieldsCorner MTBA-Station was a great plus,so we left our car in the street at the house
All in all compared to the room pricing in and around boston,70USDs was alright,"most important the bathroom was clean. Would do it again if the Boston Hotel prices don´t go down. (which is not to be expected)\"",,,
47521,1075182,2012-04-02,1997530,Carole,"Hermina's house is easy to find, clean and comfortable.  We stayed in the downstairs room which is huge, great bed, private bathroom.  Hermina let us help ourselves to food, tea etc and we enjoyed chatting to her and the other guests.  A great way to experience real Boston and see an area you probably wouldn't  visit. Def recommend it."

Hermina is a friendly and responsive host,we enjoyed talking to her whatever little time we had for this during our single day in Boston.,,,,
House has everything necessary for a comfortable stay,the only issue possibly is that there is a single bathroom for all guests. So if several people are visiting,this place becomes a bottleneck in the mornings and evenings.,,,
If we travel to Boston again,we'll definitely consider staying here.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
47521,1154179,2012-04-20,393564,Jim,Hermina is very nice & accomodating.  And it's great to have folk from around the world visit during both my stays.  Hemina's artistic flair makes the decor enjoyable in all areas.
There are numerous good-quality local eateries and the local supermarket,3-minutes walk away,has dramatically improved its stock of quality & produce & packaged foods.  Hermina maintains a good variety of condiments,etc. for cooking & eating at home.,,
"The nearby \"\"T\"\" (subway) is only a couple stops farther from downtown than pricey west-end hotels would be; and the extra distance is elevated",offering a pleasant view of the south bayside and the neighborhoods.  Plus,Dorchester is a distinct neighborhood apart from downtown,"and I found people to be friendly and much more \"\"open\"\" to conversation and direction-questions.\"",,
47521,1242621,2012-05-07,916767,Bruce,"This location is very close to the T-Line and very convenient - making it easy to go anywhere in Boston that you want!  The host, Hermina, is laid-back and very helpful in a straightforward, welcoming manner.  We found our room to be clean and very comfortable with all the amenities we needed (clean linens, a nice comfortable bed, etc.).  We really appreciated the access to the kitchen with all we needed to cook breakfast.  I would strongly recommend this location and host to any traveler looking for a short stay in Boston… Thank you Hermina, it was great!"
47521,1296223,2012-05-17,2056725,Katharina,"During my stay in the US I had several Airbnb experiences, but the stay at Hermina's place was definitely the best! The room was very clean and nice furnished. Breakfast was perfect: fresh fruits, cereals, coffee, tea, bagels,etc. We also were able use the kitchen to cook something for dinner, which was great. The house is well located, only 3-5 minutes to walk to have access to the T-red-line, which takes you directly to downtown Boston or Boston South Station (the place where the buses to NYC etc. leave) . The area around the house is very safe and there are many supermarkets and shops where you can buy food. Hermina herself is a wonderful host: very friendly, open-minded and warmhearted. We had lot's of great and interesting conversations and she even took us for a walk to Castle Island  in the evening and drove my mother to the airport at the last day. I would definitely recommend this place and if I once will visit Boston again I would check-in at Hermina's place again!"
47521,1363736,2012-05-28,2206194,Virginia,"Our room at Hermina’s house was beautiful, clean, spacious and very comfortable, we had everything we needed and even extra attention.

47521,1527066,2012-06-20,1895055,Dimple,Hermina was a wonderful host.  We needed a very quick one night place to stay and this was a great a pick.

47521,1884671,2012-08-04,2866859,Mary,Hermina is a very pleasant and accommodating host. When my wife and I first booked with her we thought she was on Park St. in the Beacon Hill area of Boston and then realized she was in Dorchester Center. Initially we were a little concerned with the proximity to downtown Boston and safety but after spending four comfortable nights in the attic room with the portable A/C we were quite pleased with the convenient location and our stay. It’s a 5 minute walk to the Fields Corner Red line train station which takes about 10 - 12 minutes to the heart of the main tourist areas and connecting train lines. The (T) Train system is very efficient and easy to use. We felt quite safe in the area and the local police station is on the adjacent lot at the rear of her home. We really enjoyed our time in Boston. Thanks Hermina.

She has brilliant taste in both food and decor, and we thoroughly enjoyed every moment that we spent conversing with Hermina. She is very helpful and caring towards all her guests.

We had to stay a couple extra days at her place due to some unforeseen circumstances, and she was very accommodating towards us. We would definitely come back here!!!"

47521,2339789,2012-09-18,2577054,Floris,"We came across this place more or less by coincidence, but it turned out to be just what we were looking for. Hermina is very friendly, the house in a spot that is much more quite that one would expect to find around there and it's a short walk to the nearest metro."
47521,2433639,2012-09-27,3185448,Louisa,"Hermina was very helpful too us.  We had a change in plans which meant we were in Boston a day earlier than we thoought.  Hermina was kind enought to accommodate.  She was very helpful with directions and whilst we were only there during the night, we were very grateful for her hospitality."
47521,2513641,2012-10-05,2454134,Mario,"It was easy to find Hermina with her detailed directions. We enjoyed our stay in her house. The neighborhood felt safe and there are also some shopping possibilities and restaurants. Although, traveling to Downtown Boston takes just 20 minutes and subways are leaving frequently."
47521,2538946,2012-10-08,3048563,David,"Beautiful room in a beautiful house. Hermina is a great host, welcoming and hospitable. Good location in south of Boston, near of train station it was perfect. Moreover Boston is a fantastic city, Thank you ;)."

47521,3729872,2013-03-09,1560799,Mizuhiro,"Hermina was really kind to us all time. When we arrived, she left some nice fruits and bread to us, and recommended some favorite restaurants in neighborhood. The house was clean and comfortable."
47521,3845560,2013-03-20,1539634,Eunsong,"This is truly a beautiful house and a wonderful place to stay. Hermina made sure that I could check in early and was helpful throughout. Everything that you need is there. My only note of concern was that my room did not have a lock, but I was the only person there so it wasn't a problem. Thanks Hermina/Miler!"
47521,4211693,2013-04-19,393564,Jim,"\"Hermina is a pleasant hostess: >>attentive to your needs but not intrusive or overly chatty, >>does not \"\"hover\"\" when you're in the common areas"
"The accommodations are comfortable and the decor has a nice \"\"artsy\"\" flair.  The rooms are large and have ample furnishings",again with pleasing decor.,,,,
"The house is very E-Z to commute to Boston by the \"\"T\"\" subway and has ample street parking.  \"\"T\"\" commute to Downtown about 20-minutes from the house--TOTAL including walking to the station!",,,,,
This is my 3rd stay and I've yet to encounter any trouble in the neighborhood,including many late-night commutes,"some with a large suitcase to/from the \"\"T\"\".",,,
I'll be back,"next Boston Marathon!!\"",,,,
47521,4344706,2013-04-29,3501521,Valentina,"We stayed at Hermina's place for 2 nights and we rented the C room, so we had the whole attic for the 4 of us. Hermina was a great host. It was very interesting talking to her and she gave me very good advices. The house is one block away from the subway so we moved around easily also at night.And as it mentioned in the house description parking was not a problem.thank you"
47521,4403252,2013-05-03,5145700,Bryan,"Close to public transit, location had good restaurants close by.  Hermina was very helpful and even let us use her GPS.  Nice experience."
47521,4440710,2013-05-05,4633666,Megan,Hermina was out of town when we arrived but the directions of how to get to her place and find our room were simple to follow.  It's only short walk from the T and a short ride into downton.  We met Hermina prior to leaving and she was very helpful and we enjoyed our stay.
47521,4485076,2013-05-07,6155252,Marie,very nice host!
47521,4532261,2013-05-11,1668874,Crystal,"My parents and I were pleased with our stay in room C. It was comfortable and clean. The house is situated very close to the T, enabling us to easily go downtown whenever we wanted. It was easy to find food nearby as well. Hermina was also very helpful, offering us directions, telling us places to check out, and offering us breakfast. Thanks for the great stay, Hermina!"
47521,4555203,2013-05-12,79531,Daniel,"Hermina is a delightful hostess, and her home is located just 2 blocks from the Red Line T station.  There are many restaurants and shops within walking distance.  Her home is comfortable and next to a police station so you'll feel safe in this transitional neighborhood.  We had the attic room, which was more space than we needed, and the common bathroom was one floor below. Hermina offered us a nice continental breakfast.  She is an interesting professional and very pleasant and will make you feel welcome."
47521,4590375,2013-05-13,5187109,Kevin,Very nice host. Accommodated us on our stay very nicely!
47521,4612601,2013-05-15,4969597,Yijun,The host is friendly and helpful. We thank for her great hospitality! And I left one airplane pillow in her house and she sent it to my home address.
47521,4668665,2013-05-19,5803328,Jia,The house is very cozy to stay and the subway is very close and there are lots of restaurant nearby! Hermina is super helpful and had some very good advice to get the direction!
47521,4882059,2013-05-30,6462127,洋,Hermina is a great host! She helped us and gave us great advice. thank you!!!
47521,4906737,2013-06-01,6143538,Timothy,Hermina was a very nice and friendly host. The house is also very near the subway and is pleasant to live in with a very nice interior. It was also interesting chatting to the other people living there.
47521,4997383,2013-06-06,670021,Jay,"We had a great stay at Hermina's lovely Victorian house. Room C was very roomy even for 3 people (my Mom, my friend and me) and the house is as shown in the pictures: warm, well kept, and very homey. The house is conveniently located -- 5 minute walk to the T red line and the center where there are grocery stores, McDonald's, and other shops and restaurants. There's a nice Vietnamese restaurant at the corne. The neighborhood is safe and we had no worries coming home at 11PM. The T red line takes you straight to the South Station where the train and buses are and also to main destinations like Boston Common, Harvard University and MIT."
Most importantly,Hermina is a very gracious host. She promptly answers queries and accommodates even last minute requests like additional nights (which we ended up not using because of IT changes). Hassle free check in. On the first night,she went out of her to show us around Castle Island where we did a post dinner walk to burn the calories while exchanging really interesting and insightful stories about life,culture,and human relations. She offered breakfast and delicious soup.,
"I will definitely stay at Hermina's again and recommend that you do too!\"",,,,,
47521,5016917,2013-06-07,6626391,Jonathan,Hermina was a nice host.  I arrived late but she waited for me and m made sure my friend and I had a comfortable nights rest.  That morning she had coffee and breakfast ready for us which  was a nice durprise.
47521,5163486,2013-06-16,1856161,Valentina (& Pietro),"We barely saw Hermina during our short stay because she was out for work, but she seems a nice person. Directions and organization was good. Our room was a bit slovenly and the bathroom was quite dirty, probably because the host wasn't there and there were several guests in the house."
47521,5242894,2013-06-20,5447891,Nishanth,"Accurate description. Very close to the subway line. Hermina was very helpful and allowed us to use her kitchen. The stair can be a bit tricky if there are heavy bags, but it is very manageable. The air conditioning was good and the room can sleep 4-5 people comfortably. A much cheaper option than staying in the city."
47521,5385098,2013-06-27,3120094,Trista,"We enjoyed our stay with Hermina. The house is absolutely lovely.  We stayed on the 3rd floor and had so much space.  We loved it!  It was so hot when we arrived, Hermina offered us ice cream to cool down.  My daughter was very appreciative.  The location was perfect.  We were so close to the T, it made visiting downtown super easy.  The area is very safe, very diverse, and friendly.  There is a park nearby if you have a child along.  I can't say enough good things about Hermina's hime.when you walk in her door you feel welcome and feel like you are at an old friends home. Wonderful experience!!!"

47521,5562170,2013-07-06,6547364,Jason,Room was excellent! We stayed on the top floor (attic) which was spacious and clean. The staircase is steep if that is a consideration. Hermina was very friendly and a great host. The house is close to a T Line (about 10 minute walk) for easy access to downtown.

47521,6284049,2013-08-06,6733149,Xiaoai,"My mom and two aunts really liked this house. They liked it better than a hotel. However, on Saturday night the neighbor was having a house party and the music was so loud until I don't know when. We fell asleep at some point in the morning because of the tiredness. But the neighbor's problem is not really the house's problem. Overall it's a nice house! Thanks, Hermina!"

The house is close to the subway, and is an easy ride downtown, as advertised. I would recommend Hermina's place and would also stay here again."
47521,7842126,2013-10-05,9132191,Marion,"Our stay felt like visiting relatives, Hermina was very kind and welcoming.

47521,8493679,2013-11-02,6350250,Hamish,The big plus for this facility is its location because it is a five minute walk to the subway station which gives you easy access to all the main sights in Boston.
The room we had was clean,and we were welcome to use the kitchen and living area which we did. We were at Hermina's over Halloween and a nice touch was that she left us a little Halloween treat and cookies.  A small concern,which turned out to be no problem for us,is that your private room doesn't lock.,,
"Overall this was a good place for the price. \"",,,,,
47521,8585770,2013-11-06,8155094,Hyunwoo,Great house. Thank you.
47521,8811655,2013-11-19,145894,Laura,"I enjoyed my stay in Hermina's house.  The other guests were friendly and interesting.  Attic room adequate, though the narrow, steep steps were a bit rough, especially for the middle of the night bathroom runs.  Great for the price.  I would stay there again (in one of the other rooms).  Vietnamese restaurant around the corner on main road outstanding and inexpensive.  5 min walk to train.  Felt safe walking streets to go to dinner."
47521,8853746,2013-11-21,2429825,Jennifer,I extended my stay with Hermina by one night because I was too sick to drive home.

It is a great deal for the price!
47521,9109526,2013-12-07,3230853,Hidefusa,"Located less than 5 minutes from the Red Line (Fields Corner Station), next to a police facility, the complex is convenient and safe. The host had prompt and excellent communication in replying to questions about arrival. My room had a gigantic bed, and since the neighborhood was very quiet, I got copious rest at night. The bathroom was maintained in pristine condition, and the shower water warmed up very quickly in the morning. I also appreciated the little things like the bathroom rug and the towel. I wish I had the time to stay for another night!"
47521,9143764,2013-12-09,10184932,Mary-Teresa,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Hermina's house. The bedroom was really nice and comfortable and there was a complimentary breakfast which we were delighted about! The house is really close to the train which is great: it's about a 20 minute ride to Downtown Boston so very handy! Both Hermina and Donna are always reachable by text or phone if you need anything: they were so nice and helpful! I highly recommend!
47521,9229485,2013-12-15,10156530,David,"We had a great time at Hermina's house. We didn't get to meet her, but everything was arranged perfectly. We had a separate part of the house for ourselves.

47521,11010275,2014-03-17,153116,Mary Anna,A wonderful stay in a warm and friendly home.  The house itself is perfectly located for easy access into Boston.  Being able to park the car for free is a big bonus!  But the best part is Hermina! She is a charming and very helpful host.
47521,11479036,2014-04-04,744844,Maya,I didn't have the chance to meet Hermina but she left very good instructions on how to get to her house. She also left her help's contact Donna who was very nice on the phone. The house was clean and everything was as described. I didn't get to see the neighborhood but it was not too inconvenient to get to MIT since the house is close to the train.
47521,11850598,2014-04-16,2221279,Shamika,Hermina and Donna were wonderful. My last minute request was so well accommodated. The house is lovely and easily (EMAIL HIDDEN)mute to downtown is simple and quick.
47521,11910013,2014-04-18,13923438,Tina,My fiance and I were in boston for one night and we stayed at Hermimas home. It was very clean and organized room. We had full use of the kitchen and washer/dryer. It was a full house but very enjoyable. We didn't get a chance to meet Hermina but her and the house manager were very helpful via phone with any questions we had. Would definitely stay there again!
47521,11926797,2014-04-19,13399066,Deborah,"Yes, it is a beautiful Victorian house...BUT...  I found it cold; both in temperature and ambiance. No personal contact with the owner. Conveniently located. It is near a train station.  BUT... I wouldn't choose to stay there again."
47521,12107867,2014-04-23,5880714,Tonya,"What a great trip! Trying to stay anywhere in Boston during the marathon for a reasonable price seemed almost impossible. We found Hermine's place and she does not raise her prices sky high like most other places. This was perfect as anywhere else we would have had to spend it all on accommodation. rHermine was so helpful, when room situations changed she made sure it was ok with us, which it was. The house is beautiful and the room was perfect! She gave us easy to follow instructions to get from the airport. It's not a fancy part of town but as 2 females traveling together we never once felt unsafe, even at night. While we did not get to meet the owner, her property manager was available and helped us out. Highly recommend this house if you want a close but quiet place in an authentic Boston location."
47521,12382803,2014-04-30,14450975,Lucy,"My husband and I had a very enjoyable and friendly ( thank you so much Donna!) overnight stay at Hermina's B&B . The location is brilliant for the subway system, the bed and room were big and comfortable, and the laundry room was a huge convenience! It is located outside of the main downtown area but the subway system is fast ( less than 5 minutes into downtown ) and the B&B is in a handy location for basic ( grocery, banks , Dunkin' Donuts ) items.  We would definitely stay there again, and loved the relaxed atmosphere ( thank you again, Donna :-D)"
47521,12982039,2014-05-16,3108391,Jing,This is a beautiful house. Very lovely and clean. Everything we needed was at hands. Also it's really close to the redline train. A perfect place for staying at Boston. We didn't get a chance to meet Hermina and Donna. But they were always approachable.

Our room was very spacious and comfortable on the second floor. It's very close to a police office. If we back to Boston we'll repeat on Herminia's House.
47521,13858816,2014-06-06,8051319,Sam,Hermina runs a great B and B service we met other guests and the facilities are great! We were able to do a wash and cook in the kitchen also we had great weather so sat out on the porch! Easy location to the red line which takes you direct to South station/downtown and harvard! A great stay!
47521,14629703,2014-06-23,2269335,Leslie,"We had a nice stay at Hermina's house. Things were pretty clean and instructions were very clear. Both Hermina and her house manager, Donna, we're extremely responsive before and throughout the stay. Very close to the Red line stop, which was convenient for traveling to downtown Boston. We found parking right out front. Neighborhood can seem a little sketchy late at night, but we had no problems whatsoever.

47521,16858012,2014-08-03,18158488,Matthew,Spacious and clean attic space with freshly made beds and clean towels was waiting for us.  Hermina was very communicative beforehand so there was no confusion finding the right place or gaining access.  Great experience.  Thanks!

Por medio del libro de visitas pudimos expresarle nuestro agradecimiento y por los detalles que incluye en la casa (avisos escritos, decoración, mensajes) sentimos su presencia aunque no estuviera."
47521,17432508,2014-08-12,14663899,Alain,"Enorme déception ! Personne à l'arrivée, logés dans un sous-bassement avec seulement une petite lucarne et tous les bruits de tuyauterie de toilettes de toutes les chambres. La maison de la photo est coupée en deux avec chacune salon, salle à manger trois chambres à l'étage et une au sous-sol donc en tout 8 chambres ! Ce n'est pas ma conception B&B. En plus le quartier n'est pas top (regardez sur Internet)"
Huge disappointment! Nobody was there when we arrived,the flat is underground with only a small window and we were hearing noises coming from the pipes of all the toilets of the house. The house on the picture is cut in 2 with in both parts: living room,dining room and 3 bedrooms upstairs. This brings to 8 the number of bedrooms with the 2 underground! It is not my vision of B&B. Moreover,the neighborhood is not great (check on internet).,,

I stayed in a large basement room with a huge bed; a bit dark but fine if one only comes there to sleep. I never met Hermina personally but she answered all my queries promptly."

Note there is a very steep flight of stairs in order to access this room -just watch your step especially with luggage in-hand.  Neighborhood felt safe (esp with Boston Police Department as a neighbor!).  On-street parking was super easy.  Would stay here again without hesitation!"

Home:  Exceptionally clean, and very organized.  Issue:  I would not recommend room C for anyone with children, or older, or physically unfit people.  The stairwell leading to the attic was very dangerous, and I hurt my ankle.  Also, this top level room had angled ceilings, and not recommend for anyone over 5'.  Noisey:  It is in the middle of busy city life, so it was not peaceful, lots of cars, people, sirens;  all hours of the night.  But the host was great, very hospitable."

47521,21056741,2014-10-10,19038635,Naome,"Room C was a good stay! My sister and I were not at the house very often but it was perfect for what we needed. It was clean, very quaint, and close to the train station. My only critique is that the stairs to the room were a bit steep and the ceilings a bit low (the are sloped because its an attic room), which can get annoying if you are planning to stay for a long time."
47521,22725592,2014-11-12,10784048,HongHao,The house is very close to red T. My room has plenty of spaces. Hermina has prepared a lot of things that her guests needs. Overall the  house is very clean.
47521,22782978,2014-11-14,18292195,Cynthia,"The stay at this place was fun. It is in a real Boston neighborhood with the police station literally in the back yard.  It was a well maintained room and Hermina was kind, welcoming and ready with suggestions where to eat.  I got a chance to peek at the attic room everyone was talking about and I did not see the issues everyone was complaining of. Yes the ceiling was not high but there was alot of room up there.  I hope she starts renting it out again and just warns people about the layout.  If I had a large group I would love to use that room.  We do not have alot of attic rooms in Texas and it would be a novelty to stay in one."
47521,25213380,2015-01-09,23252327,Jennifer,"Hermina was an excellent host. While she was not there to let us in, the check in process was very smooth and easy. She provided easy and clear instructions to get to and into the property. The room was fantastic and catered to all our needs."

47521,28035801,2015-03-16,13010391,Anthony,"This Victorian house was an excellent place to stay in the Boston area. It was a short 5 minutes walk to the red line that brought us straight to city center, and the rooms and toilets were in great conditions. No complaints!"
47521,28348905,2015-03-22,29011608,David,"Cozy house in Dorchester, we were 3 young students and we stayed at the attic. The attic was huge! Everything was great and it was 5 min walk to the subway. Hermina wasn't around but she had a friend living at the house, if we needed any help. Great experience overall."
47521,29328947,2015-04-06,9197962,Pauline,"Très bonnes informations envoyées avant l'arrivée. Tous les renseignements nécessaires ont été transmis par Hermina. Sur place, une personne nous a montré notre chambre et le fonctionnement de la maison."
47521,29992555,2015-04-15,29629889,Robert,I and my friends were very happy with our accommodations and Hermina's place. We stayed in the attic room (C). (The house has several other nicer bedrooms that may be available - lots of options for different size groups.)
Room C,as advertised,was minimalist but it was a big open space and had plenty of room for the three of us to sleep and spread out our stuff (slanted ceilings so not a lot of head room for the large amount of floor room). The staircase to the room is very steep and the bathroom is one floor below so don't stay in this room if you would have a problem with those things. There are also only a few outlets in the room so don't plan to plug in a lot of electronics.,,,
The kitchen,dining room and living room are very nice and the bathrooms are clean and functional.,,,,
The neighborhood was okay with a few bars and restaurants,a grocery store,liquor store and other shopping. We picked up groceries and made breakfast each day. The kitchen is well appointed and well organized. The only problem with the neighborhood is that there are usually people hanging out in the area of the shopping center. If you find this type of environment uncomfortable you may not be entirely happy with the neighborhood but we did not have any trouble with anyone other than minor annoyance from a pan-handler. Note that the house is next to the police station so it is in a very safe place.,,,
The subway station is just a few blocks walk from the house - less than a 5 minute walk. Public transport is the way to go in Boston - you can get a 7 day pass for $19 that gives you unlimited use that even includes the inner harbor ferry. I found this subway stop just as convenient for my needs as when I have stayed near the Back Bay stop - yes I had to plan additional time but it was just as easy to get to all the places I visited.,,,,,
If you will be driving to Boston for your visit you will be happy to hear parking is simple near Hermina's place. Street cleaning rules only make you move your car once every two weeks so it should be easy to arrive,park and not worry about your car until you need it.,,,,
"I will most definitely stay at Hermina's place for future trips to Boston. Most likely I will stay in one of the other rooms but I was very happy with my stay in Room C for this visit.\"",,,,,

However there wasn't much for breakfast and it wasn't until our last morning that there was a loaf of bread and a box of Cheerios. Apart from that it was a great location for getting around the city and to the airport and perfect for our needs.
47521,47523199,2015-09-20,21466293,Caitlin,"I never actually made it to Boston to stay with Hermina, but it's worth noting that Hermina contacted me almost immediately to say hello and give directions/instructions for the house after I booked a room with her. She responded to all of my messages promptly, and was very warm and courteous. If I ever do stay in Boston, I will definitely reserve with her."

Stairs to attic room were quite steep so probably not recommended for those with very heavy luggage. Good location and very close to metro stop. No problems with the local area. Located right in the middle of some great Vietnamese eateries. Host was welcoming and very pleasant to talk with. Overall, a pleasant stay."
47521,50215007,2015-10-10,7344434,Lena & Sven,Herminas house is nice but we had the impression that it is more an Inn than a private home. Our room C on the third floor was spartanic but ok. Don't bring heavy luggage - the stairs are very steam. Hermina helped us to transport our bags upstairs. She offers a little breakfast.

Dorchester might not be the most beautiful area of Boston, but I was perfectly fine and didn't feel unsafe whatsoever. The house is beautiful and the code system for the front door makes things very easy. The rooms are small but pretty, the attic room under the roof is bigger, but not as beautiful as the smaller ones. Maybe that room is more appropriate for 2 or 3 students and not so much for a professional person."

47521,66378233,2016-03-22,20722513,Linda,"My friend and I stayed in the attic room which was exactly as described. I wish I had paid better attention to the previous reviews about the bathroom because there were many people sharing one, which is not something that I like to do. Nevertheless, it worked out well enough. The attic room is spacious, no frills and inexpensive. The steps are steep but didn't pose a problem for us."
Hermina was entertaining friends from Armenia when we visited. Her attention was focused on them,understandably. We did not have much of an opportunity to speak with her because we didn't feel as though we should interrupt their visit. Hermina was friendly and we enjoyed the limited interaction that we had with her,but the situation didn't allow for what I have come to consider a 'typical' Airbnb experience. We felt intrusive whenever we came into the kitchen/dining room area while her friends were around. It would probably have been better to make the attic room unavailable during their stay.,,,
We did find a wonderful new coffee shop that was located a couple of blocks away. It is called Home.stead Bakery and Cafe. I recommend it highly. The neighborhood is gentrifying and mixed. As two women,we felt safe enough while walking around the area.,,,,
In general,it was a very affordable,clean and reasonably comfortable space. I did not see a fire escape from the attic room which was a bit concerning. And we were not offered a key to lock our room but to be fair,we never asked for one. It was fine,our things were safe and so were we. If you are looking for an inexpensive stay in the area and not particular about any of the details I've mentioned,"it is a fine place to stay. \""

The house is very convenient as it is walking distance to the Red Line of the MTA which goes directly into Boston and then on to Cambridge. It is easy walking distance to the main street and in between a police station and a buddhist prayer house.

47521,85002901,2016-07-10,71949361,Jedidiah,Hermina was a gracious hostess and very helpful when it came to recommendations for restaurants in the area. Her place is right next door to a police station so you hear their presence while you're staying in the area. My friend and I enjoyed the Pho restaurant that was very close to us.
The house felt very similar to staying at a hostel with all of the other travelers staying as well; I counted 14 on the night we stayed there!,,,,,

Good points : hermina was nice,and answered to our questions. We were able to park around the house easily. The recent photos correspond to the place.,,,,
Bad points : the neighbourhood seemed a bit unsafe but we didn't have any troubles. The room we had was not very pleasant : Orange walls,old furnitures,not real bed,dark room under the roof,we were not able to stand up without hitting our head on the roof ...,

9614024,85989542,2016-07-14,76928981,Peter,"Elif's place had a very convenient location. It was close to the subway, convenience stores, and restaurants. Also, getting the keys and access to the appartment was very quick and easy. Elif was very nice and was there to answer any questions we had.  However, there were a few things that made us feel uncomfortable in regards to the cleanliness and quality of the appartment. The entrance to the building smelled very strongly of urine. We also found a used condom wrapper under the bed. While sleeping at night, you could hear clawing from some type of rodent underneath the kitchen counter. We were not able to see what it was because there were boards nailed down to cover it, but we could hear it pretty much all night long."
9614024,87726387,2016-07-21,63669269,Keira,"My husband and I traveled to Boston and stayed at Elif's studio apartment for one week in July 2016. Elif was easy to communicate with and since she was not going to be in town to meet us, she arranged for a friend to meet us with the keys to the apartment. All of this went smoothly and I was impressed with her great communication. The apartment is in a great area, close to the subway and within walking distance to several restaurants and bars. However, the outside doorway leading into the apartment is not very clean and it smelled very strongly of urine. This made me feel slightly uncomfortable because you have to pass through this doorway in order to get into the apartment. Also, the apartment does not have AC and it was extremely hot while we were there. We were expecting there to be at least some type of fan but none was provided so we had to purchase one from CVS. I found this a bit disappointing because without AC, a fan is definitely a necessity. The bed in the apartment is uncomfortable and does not sleep two people very well. The springs were practically popping out and it was difficult to get a good night's rest. I felt like this apartment just provided the bare minimal in terms of what you would need while on a trip. There were no towels in the bathroom to shower with (we had to purchase these as well) and no hand soap in the bathroom to wash your hands. Also, there is no cable TV and we couldn't get local channels to come in either. There is wifi but we couldn't even get Netflix to work on the TV because it was linked to Elif's account. There was a DVD player so we rented red box movies from CVS to pass the time in the evening. If you're looking for a convenient location and are not planning on spending a lot of time at the apartment then this would be a good choice. However, if you will be spending a lot of your time at the apartment, I would not recommend this apartment."

9614024,89348281,2016-07-28,19780472,Al,Let's start with the positive: Great location. Very close to the orange and green lines of the T. Nearby restaurants and bars. Great jazz club two doors away. Economically priced. The apartment was clean.
But then: No bath towels. Really? That is just a basic. Bed sheets are not fitted. Bed is small,too small for two people. No AC. I know it wasn't listed,but it is needed in the city in the summer. The fan provided did help,but then the window is open and you get the city noise,and there is a lot of it. It is right on Mass Ave! And there is that smell in the hallway......,
This could be a nice apartment. Provide some basic things like TV,towels,"AC and a decent bed. Put some fresh paint on the walls. And get the building owner to clean the hallway!\"",,,

I particularly appreciated the apartment's close proximity to the subway station. The Freedom trail is literally a 10 min subway ride away.!"
I will say though that I was unimpressed with the apartment building itself. There was a pungent smell once you enter the building. However,"I'm unsure how any of that is the host's fault. Still I'm putting it out there so that future occupants are aware. \"",,,,

Sleeping on the futon,I felt like I was laying on a county jail cells bed. NO padding,I had to use the throw pillows to have a makeshift padding.

If staying
The spot would have been more tolerable if there was AC,it was really uncomfortable waking up with your shirt soaked in sweat.,,,,
Elif was extremely nice the times I talked to her prior to my stay,so it's not a knock on her,but this is my honest and non-biased review. When I booked,she had no reviews,now I know better for next time. As a first time user,"make sure to book a place with reviews. \""

However, during out trip to Boston during a heat wave, it was a really big deal. When we arrived, the main floor was 87 degrees. A standing fan and ceiling fan were running, but it did nothing to make things bearable. The basement was slightly cooler, at 77 degrees. Unfortunately, 2 of the 3 bedrooms are on the main floor, so my wife and I needed to sleep on the couch and floor of the basement at night. Jesus was helpful in telling us that there was a window unit we could use, but it only fit in the basement - the main floor remained sweltering. I have no doubt that this is not a problem most of the time, but for our trip it was a huge headache."
The rest of the house was very nice,and the yard and grill were very convenient. The neighborhood was nice,and the market was very convenient only a few blocks away. The house is pretty spacious and in good condition. I am sure that we would have had a wonderful stay there if it weren't a heat wave.,,,

6400432,95254943,2016-08-19,86104195,Elizabeth,"Jesus was a very polite host and responded fairly quickly when asking questions while we stayed at his home.  We were new to airbnb and missed that the home did not have air conditioning on the listing.  This would have been fine, but I would recommend having more fans for the home then.  It was very uncomfortable and stifling, even in the basement, during the hot weather.  There was only one portable fan (and only one ceiling fan in the master bedroom) in the home.  Jesus did offer to reimburse us if we wished to purchase another fan for the home, so we appreciated that, but it was not convenient in our schedule to do so, and the weather cooled off slightly to make it more bearable.  Because not all of the windows can be opened to give a better breeze, this would especially have been helpful.  I can see where the main floor at least would be much cozier in cooler weather."
The home is definitely an older home (one of two units in the building),so there are many quirks that just come with an older home.  It was fair in cleanliness,floors definitely needed to be washed,and tub did not drain well at all,so felt dirty (Jesus warned us of this the day before we checked in,but did not know prior to booking).  Beds were comfortable
The internet service was very good.  Home is right next to a bus stop,but we didn't have a chance to take public transit.  We did try a couple of the local restaurants in the town square and were very pleased with them.  Street felt safe to go for a walk in the evening (still light out) with our kids.

Jamaica Plains is a great neighborhood,with some very interesting little restaurants. Tom was a great host.,,,,

We were greeted by a bowl of fresh fruit and bottle of Chardonnay. The kitchen is stocked with essentials and the bathrooms have toiletries. The house is quite convenient to the T and the bus.

We enjoyed walking through the beautiful neighborhood to the T and were just a short ride away from Boston Common. We also rented a car and took 3 separate day trips to Cape Ann, Newport, RI, and Martha's Vineyard. The accommodations were also perfect. With 6 of us, everyone was comfortable. The condo is so charming with the wood trim and floors. We really appreciated having 2 bathrooms and laundry facilities. The grocery store and CVS are just a short walk away as well as many restaurants. We especially enjoyed Bella Luna and the Milky Way bar. We highly recommend Tom's condo."

It has plenty of space for 6, with 3 separate sleeping areas and 2 bathrooms. It has a fully stocked kitchen, laundry, good heating for cold nights and is about a 10 minute walk to the train station to get to downtown. It is located in a very nice neighborhood with restaurants and bars within a 5 minute walk. I would definitely recommend Tom's place if you are visiting Boston."

We went into downtown Boston on both the subway and the T; would recommend the T (bus) just a few minutes walk away on the main street (Centre St.) All restaurants and grocery stores within easy walking distance."
We met Tom once,who was friendly and easy to talk to. He had provided everything in the Condo one could ask for; beds were most comfortable,showers,kitchen and dining area well laid out.,,
Couldn't help hearing the 4y.o. running about upstairs,which could annoy some people; but this is out of Tom's control.,,,,
Would definitely recommend this Condo to anyone,and if we return,who knows,"wouldn't think of staying anywhere else.  \"",,

It's a perfect location near everything a traveller especially without a car would need. The bus is half a minute away, several options for good food including a Whole Foods are less than 5 minutes away there's a pretty pond for strolling, walking or running exercise that's also less than 5 minutes away and we always had a spot to park a car too. All of these things are already in the description but to experience them is amazing. The house itself is very cozy and clean and offers both privacy yet feels intimate for groups of friends traveling together. To top it off Tom is a great guy. We met just once and had a really good conversation with him. He is the kind of guy you want to be your friend and he made us feel very welcome in general and specifically with a bottle of wine from our continent of origin wow! That felt so good. I'd really like to say something negative to balance out the review but there is nothing at all on the minus side. The experience was perfect for us."

While the walls are pretty thing so you can hear the neighbors getting ready in the morning, other than that is very quiet. We had almost no trouble sleeping.  The neighbors are also really nice.  It's really spacious and well kept.  It was also great to have cooking stuff ready to use, including a variety of spices!  Anything we were missing we just walked 5 minutes to Whole Foods or CVS.  I would definitely stay here again."

554720,13907550,2014-06-08,11286922,Jordan,"With two sets of parents and a young child in town for my husband's graduation, I wanted to find a place large enough to host the seven of us, close enough to public transportation, private enough for the two sets of parents, and nice enough to have as a retreat from the graduation festivities. Tom's condo was absolutely perfect. The cleaning fee is applied toward a professional cleaner who wipes down every nook and cranny of the condo, and we so appreciated the cleanliness of the place, as well as the attentiveness of Tom to our needs. He called us on the day of our arrival, had a manual waiting for us, and was very easy to work with. There is a CVS around the corner, a Whole Foods a couple of blocks away, and plenty of restaurants within walking distance. We would definitely stay again!"
554720,14110581,2014-06-12,11166748,Roni,"We loved staying at Tom's place. Everything was just as described, close to transport, in a gorgeous neighbourhood well worth an explore on its own merits, clean, beds were super comfy, we couldn't fault the place. Lots of great restaurants nearby, tapas jazz bookstore at the end of the street, JP Licks just down Centre St with endless choices for more eating options there too.  Some reviewers have mentioned noise from upstairs, and once or twice we did hear the pitter patter of little feet, it was nice. Not at all a problem. Safe neighbourhood, beautiful house.  Do yourself a favour and stay here."
554720,15024036,2014-07-01,9711258,Ariel,"We were in town for our son's wedding and needed a home base. Tom's place was that and more.  We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in.  Everything was clean and easy to find.  We arrived late in the night, but check-in was a breeze.  The kitchen was quite well stocked with everything we could need.    The upstairs residents were also very nice.  The neighborhood was quiet, with ample street parking and easy access to the CVS and the Whole Foods.  Tom left us a handbook with lots of useful information to make our stay pleasant and with clear instructions and expectations. He was also very responsive to my questions.  My family and I really felt at home.  I would definitely recommend this place and would rent it again."

The dining room is quite large and accommodated 10 of us one evening for supper. There is plenty of china, silverware, etc. and the dishwasher was a big plus after feeding that crowd. We loved the beautiful old woodwork and wood floors, so in keeping with the older neighborhood. Beds were extremely comfortable and there is an abundance of linens and towels. All was quiet from upstairs neighbors; no footsteps heard at all (and we know they were home as we had met them earlier.) Many thanks to Tom and to airbnb for making this home available."
554720,16077518,2014-07-22,1806673,Catherine,The Host is very helpful. The place reflects Boston character. It is a perfect place for a family to stay and it is not far from downtown. There is a bus directly takes you there. The place is clean and has everything as a home away from home.

Also an easy walk to the T for our day in central Boston. We braved 10 Tables with kids in tow for a quick meal at the bar, which worked well, great of ice cream options nearby too! I noticed before we stayed that a few people commented about noise upstairs. We only ever heard footsteps and during daylight hours. This was not a problem at all."

Omgivningarna var trevliga, nära till både parker, resturanger och allmänna kommunikationer. Samtidigt var området mycket lugnt och hemtrevligt. Det var inte heller några problem att parkera bilen på gatan utanför."
Det fanns en beskrivning över var man kunde hitta livsmedelsaffärer och rekommenderade resturanger,och hur man enklast tog sig in till centrum. Vi träffade inte Tom,utan pratade bara med honom i telefon,men nyckelöverlämningen gick mycket smidigt och allt fungerade bra så det fanns ingen anledning att ha kontakt med Tom.,,

There was a Wholefoods supermarket, as well as many restaurants, and some beautiful streets of 1920's houses in the vicinity.  The train was walking distance also, it took roughly ten minutes to walk to the station.  We loved Boston and Tom's place.  Tom was readily available and helpful at all times."

The condo is kid friendly and in a great location - close to restaurants and ice cream.  We brought our portable crib and our daughters slept in the small TV room - my 5-year-old slept on the couch and we set up the portable crib right next to it.  Aside from getting the lock box code from Tom, we didn't have any interaction with him during our stay because everything went very smoothly.  Parking on the street was always available.

It is a 1920’s brick building with beautiful dark wood trim, classic wood floors and comfortable beds and furniture.  A person can tell that Tom invested great care into restoring a wonderful home.  The house is clean. There are three air-conditioners and several fans that helped us keep cool when it was humid outside.  We were delighted to be able to stay there for a week and our whole family was quite comfortable."
The neighborhoods around the house are likewise charming.  We walked toward Jamaica Pond one day and saw many classic homes on tree-lined streets.  The same is true of the neighborhood along the ten-minute walk to the Stony Brook T-station.  Speaking of taking the T,The MBTA route-map shower curtain in the master bathroom ended up helping us plan our routes for seeing the sites in the city.  That was a clever idea.,,,,

554720,39006200,2015-07-20,2148545,Teresa,"Tom was flexible and easy to work with.  The condo is clean, nicely appointed and a good geographical location in JP.  We hope the condo is available on our next trip to Boston."

554720,40552532,2015-08-01,24595079,Janeth,"Beautiful unit in a really unique neighborhood.  Street parking was never a problem.  Public bus just around the corner and the Stonybrook Orange line subway station about 12 minute walk through some nice streets, a bit longer if you want to pick up the Green Line to the north.  Great restaurants all within walking distance. As a runner training for my next race I made great use of the Jamaica Pond park just a few blocks away where every trip around the pond is 1.5 miles.  Unit itself was clean and comfortable and the beds were so very comfortable.  We made use of the kitchen to cook up the fish we caught out on our deep fishing charter trip and we appreciated the included wifi access to plan our daily adventures."
554720,42651456,2015-08-15,28165057,John,The apartment is charming and located conveniently to restaraunts and local transportation.  Bus stop only 100yds away.
Just a short walk to Sam Adams if that interests you. Easy on street parking. Ideal Pizza by bus stop has good hot/cold subs,pizza and fresh salads. Prices are very reasonable.,,,,
"Apartment contains everything needed for a pleasant stay. Clean and comfortable. If you have several people to house on your trip to Boston I can heartily recommend Tom's place.\"",,,,,
554720,44419173,2015-08-26,28584842,Moa,We loved it! It was a good location in a nice little town. We especially liked the local Samuel Adams brewery-tour that we went to.

Muy completa en cuanto utensilios de cocina, ropa de cama, y artículos de baño ( papel del baño y jabón). El barrio muy lindo, muy tranquilo, hay una escuela enfrente, pero es muy silenciosa la zona, así que ni parece que hay niños alrededor,  la casa esta a principios de cuadra de una avenida principal, donde uno encuentra la parada del camión, una farmacia que puede servir de supermercado y un whole foods que esta a unas pocas cuadras. Siempre sentimos que era un barrio seguro, muy facil de moverse. Muy recomendable"
554720,49420604,2015-10-04,31998464,Gary,"\"The accommodations were exactly as described and pictured. The facilities were clean comfortable.  The neighborhood is very nice, quiet and close to transportation, stores and restaurants. And it's close to Boston downtown (10-15 min). This was our first Air B&B and it was a pleasure to find the Condo without any disappointments. Tom was responsive and helpful if we need anything. Our week there was very enjoyable in our Boston \"\"Home away from Home\"\". Highly recommended. \""
554720,50282363,2015-10-11,39167986,Aaron,"The apartment was comfortable, spacious and spotless, and we loved the Jamaica Plain neighborhood. There are several restaurants and bars within easy walking distance, and the two-mile loop around beautiful Jamaica Pond -- just a few blocks from the condo -- is perfect for walking and jogging."
554720,51697606,2015-10-24,37947462,Gary,This is a vert nice apartment; just like the photos showed. Wholefood Is 5 minutes walk and 10 minutes walk to the subway station; restaurents close by - great location.

554720,57751507,2015-12-29,9050666,Patricia Lynne,"Tom made us feel very welcome, although he was about to depart for an Atlanta Christmas as we were arriving from Atlanta, and the previous tenant had failed to replace the key in the lockbox!  Tom took care of it expeditiously while we went off for an early Cuban supper, and all was well."
We loved the apartment,which is old fashioned in such a lovely way. We had Christmas dinner there with a number of relatives,and  everybody fit around the dining table.  About details: there are plenty of fresh linens (in a linen closet no less),a good TV,and a gas-fire fireplace.  The beds are comfortable,with plenty of covers
We would definitely stay there again,"and we recommend it to others.\"",,,,
554720,69752397,2016-04-13,55399693,Maryanne,I rented the condo because it had two bedrooms and two bathrooms.
However one bathroom was unavailable because of a planned remodel.  After talking to Tom about the inconvenience of having workmen in the condo during our stay,Tom agreed to wait until we checked out before work on the remodel continued.,,,,
"The condo is on the first floor.  A couple with a young child live in the upstairs unit.  The child was constantly in motion beginning in early morning.  It was extremely loud and annoying.\"",,,,,
554720,70680246,2016-04-19,39837453,Michael,"We were down to run in the Boston Marathon and Tom's Boston Charm condo was exactly what we wanted.  It seemed even bigger than it looked in the pictures.  It was very clean and was a great mix of old style with modern amenities.  The kitchen was well equipped, the beds were very comfortable and there was enough room for 2 couples and my teenage daughter (on the pull out couch) and my 10 year old son on the couch in front of the TV.  The location was great, not too far from the T and in a great neighborhood.  Walking distance to a lot of great restaurants, the Jamaica Pond with a great running/walking/biking trail and the Sam Adams brewery (amazing tour).  Tom was a great host and the check in/check out process was a breeze.  I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone or to stay here again.  If its available, book now!"
554720,71795758,2016-04-28,14951465,Feng,The house is very convenient and easy to get to. Room is clean and provide everything we need it. We have never met Tom but we stayed well. Thanks

554720,76047101,2016-05-24,6872687,Lisa,"We had a lovely time meeting up with family to attend the Boston College graduation of my niece. The place was as described and perfect for our needs. We appreciated the large dinning room for sharing meals. The location was a central friendly neighborhood and easy walking distance to the T, restaurants, and markets."
554720,77082168,2016-05-30,45508000,Eileen,"This house was very clean and comfortable. Tom was very flexible and responsive when we had a question about a light switch. The location was good and we always found parking. The kitchen had everything we needed and it was spacious. We could not connect via WiFi but we were in the house only at night so it was not a big deal. Also, you hear the neighbors walking throughout their unit upstairs due to the wooden flooring. We loved that it was very clean! We would stay here again."
554720,78414352,2016-06-06,23977314,Rielly,"The house itself is great! It's the bottom floor of a multi family house so in the morning there's some activity above. Nothing crazy, just people getting ready for work. It's a 10 minute walk to the metro which isn't bad. The 30 minute metro ride to downtown was less ideal. Manageable, but not ideal."
Within the neighbourhood,the location is great. Close to a CVS,"Whole Foods and JP Licks. A playground is right across the street at the school and the neighbours were great. \"",,,
554720,82661067,2016-06-28,58879721,William,Nice comfortable unit within walking diatance of many of Boston's great sights. Everything was fully functional. Truly like being at home away from home.

The condo was clean, with a well stocked kitchen for home meal preparation. Tom was available for assistance if issues with the condo arose. We enjoyed staying in this vintage Boston home."
554720,84191645,2016-07-05,43200908,Erica,"Our stay in Tom's apartment was perfect. We were a group of 2 couples and a 10 year old child and there was more than enough space for us all, it was even more roomy than we'd expected from the photos. The 2 sitting areas meant we weren't all on top of each other. The decor and furnishings were tasteful and reflected the character of the building. The place was perfectly clean and had all conveniences we could have expected. Good shower pressure. Quiet, leafy neighbourhood. Free parking on the street in front of the house. Tom communicated with us in advance and on the day of our stay to ensure we had all the information we needed. Would highly recommend this property."

No need for a car if you are just exploring Boston as the great public transport system is only a short walk away. Inexpensive and easy to use. Some nice restaurants in easy walking distance."

Having two bathrooms/showers was great as well. The location in Jamaica Plains was convenient since we went to Fenway Park two out of three nights (only an $11 cab to Fenway even with heavy traffic). The unit is super close to Jamaica Pond which is a huge park and Whole Foods/CVS is just around the corner as advertised. The local pub Canary Square was disappointing (terrible food) but \"\"Robinwood"

Easy to find, easy to get in, plus he kindly left some homemade granola!"
I may have been Liesl's first ever airbnb-er,"so I feel lucky - and would heartily recommend his place to anyone.   :)\"",,,,

3969526,20113170,2014-09-23,21083144,Jacalyn,We really enjoyed our stay.  When we walked into the apartment we had fruit and granola ( made by our hostess!!! ) waiting for us. We felt very welcomed.
The apartment was nicer than the pictures.  The beds were comfortable,and there was plenty of drawer and closet space.,,,,
We also chose the apartment because of the location near our son and daughter-in-law.  We were literally around the corner!!! Could not beat the convenience!!!!,,,,,
Because my son and wife are expecting a baby soon we hope we will be able to stay at the apartment many times in the future when we come to visit.,,,,,
The only thing I would add to this apartment is a coffee maker. The french press was nice but we enjoy perking a cup of coffee.,,,,,
Everything else was perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,,,

She was very clear with check in/out instructions which made our stay completely stress free! The area that the apartment was in was great. We love the south end with all of its restaurants,  cafes and wonderful streets to wander down..Downtown is just a short walk if you are worried about not being in the 'center' of the city. The apartment was very quiet even though it is right near a hospital. We hardly ever heard any noise."
3969526,20437023,2014-09-29,4783770,Eric,Due to a fire at an air traffic control center out here in the Midwest my flight was cancelled so I never actually stayed at Liesl's place.  What was rather surprising was that the airline & the restaurants we booked both refunded any charges due to the unusual nature of the circumstances but Liesl was unresponsive to Airbnb's request to refund our reservation. I was left with a disappointing taste.
3969526,20844813,2014-10-06,13957944,Jurriën,"Liesl's apartment is situated in a nice and quiet area of Boston, which is easily reachable by public transport. I staid in the apartment for a couple of days when I was in Boston for a conference and shared the apartment with a colleague. Due to the double bedroom, the apartment was well suited for this. The apartment itself was perfectly clean when we arrived and the bowl of fruit in the fridge was a nice surprise. We felt right at home. Next time I'm visiting Boston I will strongly consider staying there again."

3969526,22487212,2014-11-08,7127885,Francesco,The hostess and her husband were very welcoming without overstepping any bounds. One minor problem was rectified within a few hours. We particularly enjoyed her welcome Granola.
The appartment is in pristine condition as it was recently renovated. The sheets and towels were spakling white and fluffy.,,,,,
Transportation (SL4 and SL5 buses ) into central Boston were just around the corner. Several days we walked to the Museum of Fine Arts,Isabell Stewart Gardiner museum,Boston Symphony Hall and the Boston Public Library.,,,
Worcester Sqaure has a great deal of charm with it's private park and Statue. Southend Vistorain house and gardens were a great visual pleasure.,,,,,

A beautiful, historic neighborhood close to the downtown/back bay and the apartment itself could not be more welcoming, well-appointed, or spotless."
Upon arriving,the only issue we found was that the fridge was not on,which was a breaker issue. Liesl responded in a timely manner and stopped by the next day while we were out to fix it.,,,
Other than that,"it should be noted that the neighborhood is not especially \"\"car-friendly\"\". You'll need to use inconvenient metered parking on adjacent blocks or find a garage (none of which are particularly near).",,,,

I would stay here again in a heartbeat."

It was a wonderful visit despite the weather conditions."
Public transportation was only about a 5 minute walk away and got you to every main attraction the city has to offer with great ease. The neighborhood is safe and with tons of restaurants,shops and grocery stores along the main avenue nearby.,,,,
At one point the internet went out,Liesl and her husband were VERY responsive and within 24 hours it was all taken care of. I highly recommend. And would return if I had the opportunity.,,,,
Liesl did stop by twice without notice--and at one point let herself in which I found a little invasive,but nonetheless she was friendly.,,,,

3969526,29824414,2015-04-13,404491,Julie,"Our stay at Liesl's apartment was simply great. The Silver line is less than a block away, it makes it really easy to get to downtown. Newburry street is a 10-15 min walk. All the essentials are provided. The place is spotless. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat."
3969526,30011804,2015-04-16,22115236,Russell,Liesl is a very welcoming host.  She had the apartment clean and ready for us by the check-in time.  Liesl was very helpful with advice on the area and made contact throught our stay to make sure we were alright.
The apartment is in the South End part of town.  There are a few restaurants and grocery stores in the neighbourhood,however there is very little to peak a travellers interest within 15 minutes walk.  There is a bus stop 30 seconds walk away.,,,,
In the lower level of an old Brownstone building,the apartment was lovely and modern looking inside.  We had all the amenities we needed - kitchenwares,towels,extra blankets,large washing machine and clothes dryer.  Heating was good throughout.  There was very basic cable on tv,however there was a Roku box with HBO Go and Netflix etc.
The apartment was 2 bedrooms with queen beds,a bathroom,laundry,kitchen and living area.  It was large enough for our family of 4.,,
"If you are looking for somewhere quiet to stay just outside of the downtown area I would recommend Liesl and her apartment.\"",,,,,
3969526,30141806,2015-04-18,29264333,Cathy,"The apartment was just as pictured. Very nice, clean and comfortable. Beds very comfortable."
We did not have any coffee or tea there,but noticed they and some granola were left for us. It was very thoughtful. Maybe if a small carton of milk were there,we may have indulged. There are shops nearby. We just didn't bother.,,,
"Liesel is quick to answer questions and is very helpful. We would book there again.\"",,,,,
3969526,30752180,2015-04-27,18473302,Peter,"Perfect experience, exactly as described. Liesls apartment is very convenient. It's a quick ride on the silver bus line to reach downtown, there are incredible places to eat within walking distance.  Liesl is very accommodating, always checking in to make sure we had everything needed. It was a great experience all around, would definitely stay here again."
3969526,31123232,2015-05-02,14058914,Stephanie,"This is a fantastic South End location near all of the amazing restaurants and bars the neighborhood has to offer. The place itself is clean, updated, comfortable, and well kept. Check in and check out were very simple. Liesl was responsive and communicative leading up to and throughout our stay. This was overall another wonderful Air B&B experience!"
3969526,31425488,2015-05-05,26740672,Joan,The apartment was exactly as described. It was spotlessly clean and we felt at home immediately. Beds very comfortable. The location is excellent for touring Boston-just an agreeable walk from many Boston highlights.

3969526,31866504,2015-05-11,7534402,Kelsey,"Liesl was a wonderful host! I booked this apartment for my parents who were in town for the weekend. The entire process was very efficient and organized. The apartment was beautiful, clean, and spacious. Most importantly, the apartment is in a great area with some of the best restaurants in Boston located just a few blocks away."
3969526,32164787,2015-05-15,28707088,Jolene,This IS a sensational South End apartment.  High quality and clean. There are good restaurants all around was very pleased to find Equator (Thai) at 1721 Washington St.  The beds are so comfortable and the linens are towels were also of high quality.  A basket of fruit and gluten free granola was waiting for us when we arrived (being GF this was a much appreciated extra for me).   We were very happy that we did not have to make use of the umbrella's provided - the weather was perfect
3969526,32446359,2015-05-18,24776602,Meg,The host made us feel very welcome and important.  She checked in with us more than once to be sure everything was o.k.  The place was exactly like it was listed.  Perfect for us.  The neighborhood was charming South End Boston with historic brownstones.

3969526,33073345,2015-05-25,27834412,Lynn,"We were very pleased with our stay.  This apartment is clean, easy to locate and the perfect size for 2-4 people.  We found the neighborhood fun, eclectic and safe.  The apartment is well furnished and organized.  We loved the fresh fruit, granola, tea and coffee.  There are shops, restaurants and 711 very close by for convenience.  We parked at the hospital and it was safe and very reasonable for the weekend.  The host's were quick to get back to us with questions and small issues we had.  We even got a visit to fix our WIFI, which was still an issue, but they tried to fix it and we appreciated that.  We would stay here again and will recommend it to friends."
3969526,33643766,2015-05-31,24969695,Mark,"The apartment is well located, large and very clean. Liesl has included lots of extras to make the place feel as comfortable as a great hotel. Soft towels, home made muesli, tea selection etc all greatly appreciated. Some brilliant restaurants in the area and Liesl has plenty of recommendations (Yes, the Fish Taco's at Picco really are awesome!). I will certainly try here first the next time I'm passing through Boston."
3969526,34060954,2015-06-04,30681214,Neil,"Great location, an easy 30 minute walk to downtown, but transport good too. Plenty of bars and restaurants within a few minutes walk. A very comfortable apartment, spotlessly clean and a real home from home. Liesl was a great host, very attentive and quick to respond to enquiries. Would recommend without hesitation."
3969526,34515386,2015-06-09,548443,Bart,"The apartment offered enough space fir the two of us, but would also do for a party of 4. Everything was clean, excellent beds, kitchen well equiped. Because of being on the ground floor, the apartment feels a bit dark. We enjoyed the neighbourhood; quiet and nice restaurants. The only remark might be the limited availability of TV channels."
3969526,34935124,2015-06-14,27797521,Julie,"The host left welcoming notes, chocolate on the pillow cases, and e-mailed to check to see how things were going.  She made us feel very welcome."
The neighborhood was safe and clean.  It had a little park right across the street.,,,,,
"We liked that the Silver Line bus to downtown Boston was at the end of the block.  Very nice after a long day of sight seeing.  We didn't have to walk far to get to the apartment.\"",,,,,

3969526,46572901,2015-09-12,9385796,Charles,"The apartment was exactly what we needed for our trip to Boston. The rooms were big enough to make it feel like home,  the kitchen was great,  and being able to do our laundry,  iron our clothes,  and relax between conference outings made it a steal at the price."
The only downsides were a weak wifi connection and the daily construction every morning at 8am,but the latter I'm sure is just part of living in the city.,,,,
"Thanks Liesel for all your help while we were there.\"",,,,,
3969526,47177194,2015-09-16,3188999,David,"You can't oversell this Sensational South End two bedroom apartment. It is ideally located in one of the hippest parts of town. Walking distance to bars, restaurants, cafes, transportation, conveniences and downtown even! The apartment is modern, clean and very comfortable and Liesl was very responsive, friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended!"
3969526,47457395,2015-09-19,5153041,Sally,"Arriving in South End, Boston, we were unsure about the area. At first it appears pretty seedy, but turn into Worcester Sq, and see the lovely garden down the middle of the street and the historic brownstones, and hope is restored. The apartment was quiet and comfortable, with 2 bedrooms, the bed in the blue room was good memory foam mattress. Wifi was good, washer and dryer, kitchen had what you need, you just have to find supplies. Good luck at the local 711, best to grab an uber and go a few blocks away. Liesl offered restaurant ideas and we went to Toro just around the corner, twice. It was that good."
"We found the apartment to be  a welcome oasis from the heat and noise of the city. Thanks again Liesl.\"",,,,,

She was a great communicator as we made our way through the reservation process, she went above and beyond her call of duty in shopping for me so that we would have some grocery items in the fridge since we arrived to Boston on Christmas Eve and things would be closed on Christmas."
The apartment lives up to it's name and is truly sensational. She had left us her 'homemade' granola...delicious and appreciated!,,,,,
I loved that she had left so many touches that I enjoy;clean and comfortable is always at the top of my list and her apt was both,beautiful white towels,the master bedroom had a very comfortable tempur-pedic mattress and great storage in both bedrooms,each room had a luggage rack which I love and unbelievably so many hosts don't include in their guests rooms. The apt had a W/D which is always a godsend when you accidentally spill something on your favorite shirt or whatever your need for it might be,"having that is a true plus for a week long stay. Liesl has truly made her apt feel like a home away from home. \"",

The beds are extremely  comfortable! The apartment  is in a quiet street with the local bus a 5 minute walk away at the end of the street. The bus runs every 15 minutes and is a short ride into town.

3969526,81414207,2016-06-22,22908282,Dawn,"Home and Area: This place was beyond amazing.  Absolutely the nicest and cleanest Airbnb in which I've stayed.  It was a quiet sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Boston.  The home was well-appointed and had everything we could possibly need (the mark of an excellent host).  The apartment is large and you really don't feel like you're in the city.  The bedrooms are a very good size, there's lots of closet space and the beds and pillows are SO comfortable.  The neighborhood has restaurants and shops within a short walk, however Uber is a short and cheap call away if you'd like to get more into the city."
I'd like to address a couple of things that I've read in reviews: the lock on the foyer door - not a problem at all.  Liesl gives instruction on how to open it with ease.  We never found this an issue.  Don't let it stray you.  No central air - also,not a problem.  It got up to 92 degrees while in Boston and the units in the bedrooms kept things quite comfortable.  I'm typically hot natured and was very cool in the apartment.  So,don't let that stray you either.,,,
Host: Liesl was wonderful.  She was responsive,kind,had easy communication and took the time to think of the details.  She worked with us in the check-in process due to some flight issues and was very accommodating.  And while we never met her,I can't say enough how much we enjoyed and appreciated this Airbnb experience.   If ever in Boston,"this would be my go-to location.  Simply wonderful in every way!\"",

The unit itself was beautifully appointed - great kitchen, cozy living room, nice bedrooms and bathroom. The neighborhood was quiet, but we never felt too far away from great restaurants, coffee shops, bars, etc. My wife and I shared the condo with another couple we were traveling with and never felt cramped. We couldn't ask for more from an Airbnb at this price point. We would without hesitation stay here again and have already recommended it to friends."

The place was immaculate and in a perfect area for our travels. Boston is a walking city and this house was easily walk able from all over.,,,,,
Liesl gave us suggestions on where to buy groceries from,to eat and to park our rental car for the 2 days we had one. (Valet parking at the hospital at the end of the (URL HIDDEN) perfect.),,,,
The neighborhood was quiet and friendly. At one point,there was a little band playing in the little park on the weekend. So charming.,,,,
We were there during a heatwave and the AC in both bedrooms kept us very cool at night after a long day of sightseeing.,,,,,
Highly recommend Liesl's place as your base in Boston. I loved the fact that i could retire early if I wanted to and the other people in my party could stay up and watch TV (can't do that in hotels),,,,,

3969526,93086851,2016-08-11,45680868,Megan,We found Leisl's place to be a great location! Everything was very clean and as pictured on the Airbnb site. Would highly recommend. Only downside to our visit was that we couldn't get the tv to work. It was during the Olympics so was a bit disappointing that we couldn't catch much action when we were in the apartment.
3969526,93898913,2016-08-14,1632624,Sergey,"Wonderful apartment in a residential area of Boston close to Boston Medical center. The apartment is very clean and quiet. We had a car but always managed to find street parking within two blocks from the apartment (street parking is free between 6 pm and 8 am). When we had questions, Liesl immediately responded to us. Highly recommend!"
3969526,95734945,2016-08-20,29291220,Sarah,Liesl was great before and during our stay. She was very responsive when the tv stopped working and when we needed the find the breaker panel.

3969526,98939347,2016-09-02,68223471,Lester,"Liesl's apartment is very nice.  South End is one of the best neighborhood's in Boston.  It's conveniently located but still quiet and peaceful.  The apartment was clean and well stocked with everything we needed during our stay.  I was travelling with my 90 year old mother so the feature I liked most was that there are no stairs to enter the apartment.  Our last night there, there was a free concert in the square on the block.  Liesl made sure we knew about it and provided a lawn chair for us.  A very attentive host who made sure we we settled in and then left us alone.  Perfect.  I give Liesl 5 stars and highly recommend her and her apartment."

As soon as arrival we were given a key and a small tour of their home. The room we stayed was very clean and spacious. There was free parking which is always a plus. The best part of the stay was the convenient location; a Stop and Shop being a 5 minute drive away and $10 Uber to downtown Boston as well as Castle Island.

Overall, the townhouse was clean. Christian was inviting and made sure we got situated okay and that we had what we needed upon checking in. We could have used comforters or blankets, something heavier than just sheets as the AC was on throughout the night but it was no big deal. Also, the neighborhood didn't seem to be particularly safe after dark but we used Uber to get to and from places so this was not a problem for us. Overall, we enjoyed our stay in Boston and look forward to using Airbnb again in the future."

Their apt is tightly connected to the green line, making my city tour so easily accessible. The bedroom is quiet, warm and cozy, which gave me a great sleep during the snowy night. Most important, Yu Chen and Helen are both very nice persons to stay with. They recommended me the museums that I might be interested in, cooked me pancakes for breakfast, and gave me tips on going to the airport. It's hard to imagine that I'm lucky enough to find such an inexpensive place to live; it's even more hard to believe that I could meet with such warm-hearted couple to accommodate me in the freezing night! Great and sincere thanks!"

The area is studenty and close to Packards Corner T stop. It took around 20-30 mins to get into the centre from the apartment.,,,,,
The apartment itself was fine for our needs. The kitchen was quite small but workable. Our room was bright and a good size. The room shares a wall with the stairwell and the elevator shaft. The building itself is a bit noisy - the elevator is a real clanker - but we got used to it's sounds quite quickly and they didn't bother us too much.,,,,,

The neighborhood is old and urban and there are more beautiful fall trees than I have ever seen.  A short distance to great bars/pubs and cafes.  What more could you ask for?
5085125,53857177,2015-11-13,48458390,Meeyoung,친절하게 잘 맞아 주셨고. 숙소는 찾기 쉬웠고. 하버드 대학가기가 아주 편리한 위치입니다. 66번 버스타고 15분이면 도착. 주변에 한국식당 엄청많아요

5085125,54395206,2015-11-19,48029910,Nancy,Fit the bill for my brief stay in Boston. The place was super quiet. Conveniently near public transport. Easy!
5085125,55813624,2015-12-06,23620859,Alex,"YuChen was really great and let me stay at his place when he was gone. The location was amazing; right beside a 24-hour supermarket, asian food court, and public rail station that can get you downtown in 20 min. The only downside of the place is that the walls seem very thin and it's easy to hear the neighbors in the apartment complex. Might be challenging for a light sleeper."
5085125,56401652,2015-12-13,613369,Ben,"YuChen was very welcoming, and his place was comfortable and minutes from the Green Line train. An excellent deal for a short stay in Boston."

He has a great kitchen that we use all the time (thank you so much and sorry for making mess ;p) and we wish was (URL HIDDEN) for the listing is accurate, public transport was easy, conveniently located to grocery stores and restaurants. The only thing is that probably the wall is thin, we can hear the loud noises from the elevator. Thanks for hosting us!"
5085125,57597102,2015-12-27,43529708,Li,Nice place and nice people. Close to the Green line. There is also an Asian supermarket and Asian restaurants. But the elevator is too noisy.
5085125,57946883,2015-12-30,46070153,Soyoung,He was personable host! He gave some tips to get charles river and to get to the airport. Also the apartment is near the greenline. So easy to get to downtown and art museum.  But the room is near the noise elevator.. so it was little bit annoying.
5085125,58208805,2016-01-01,47205270,지연,"YuChen was communicative and nice. The room was clean and warm. Green line rail station is very close and there are also bus stops near the apartment. Overall, it was great!"
5085125,59247548,2016-01-08,48387228,Mia,Yu Chen is a friendly and nice host. Location is absolutely described as he mentioned 8-10minute walk to green line and near the supermarket. He provided everything that I needed. I recommend every travel er to live here if you would like to visit Boston without your own vehicle.
This host,"Fucking awesome!!\"",,,,

I had a wonderful experience during my stay in Boston. The house is located at a very convenient area with direct metro to downtown and with bus line direct to Harvard. I would strongly recommend it to anyone who wanna a stay in Boston.

5085125,60996397,2016-01-30,28303572,Mike,"YuChen made me felt more than welcomed, and his apartment was at a convenient location right near T stations. Moreover, the wifi was fast, the bedroom was spacious, and the bathroom was clean. I especially loved the big desk in the bedroom. I do not think I could have asked for more and I will certainly go back in the future."
5085125,62745686,2016-02-16,14165753,Ramon,"Our stay was great! The room was exactly as the listing described. A cozy room inside a Boston apartment. The room was very clean, and spacious enough. The host was kind enough to provide clean towels and a personal Brita water filter in the room. Bathroom and kitchen were also very clean. The best part about the listing is how close it is to the T line. 3-5 minute walk to the Harvard Ave. stop. YuChen was very nice and we would definitely recommend this listing to anyone visiting Boston."
5085125,63947276,2016-02-28,57205964,Jonathan,"Yu Chen and Kuan were awesome hosts! I had arrived in Boston late at night, and when I met with them, they provided some homemade pizza for me to eat in addition to all of the amenities and supplies described on their Airbnb listing. The pizza was delicious, and I felt right at home."
The room was exactly as described in the listing. In other words,it was great! However,it was sometimes too warm inside the apartment,so I wish there was a way to control the temperature of the apartment.,,
Yu Chen and Kuan were more than willing to tell me about what to check out in the surrounding area. The surrounding neighborhood was a bit run down,but it seemed safe,and I had no problem getting around Boston because the apartment was right next to the subway station. The apartment was also close to a Chinese supermarket that had a bunch of great Asian restaurants on their premises. I highly recommend checking those restaurants out.,,,
Overall,"I had a really great experience with Yu Chen. I would for sure consider this listing from Yu Chen again the next time I visit Boston.\"",,,,
5085125,64425386,2016-03-04,46313230,Camille,"Yu Chen est un hôte très accueillant mais également très discret ce qui permet de se sentir bien chez soi. La chambre est conforme à la description, simple mais suffisante pour quelques jours. Le rapport qualité prix est intéressant et permet de découvrir Boston sans se ruiner. La salle de bain est très propre et aucun soucis quant à la cohabitation. Un séjour agréable."

5085125,66375698,2016-03-22,40710468,Jakob,"Very good host, check-in was easy and the room was clean and cozy. After discovering Boston we were so tired that the elevator didn't disturb us. Next to the Green Lane the location is perfect for getting fast into the center of Boston."
5085125,67146854,2016-03-27,55484150,Moling,"We really enjoyed the trip in Boston. This was the best place we lived among airbnbs in other two cities we travelled. It was a nice, cozy place and host and hostess are very nice. They taught us about Boston and how to travel in Boston. Hope to come back again!"
5085125,67750224,2016-03-31,63964264,Julia,"Nous avons passé un bon moment chez YuChen. La chambre était très propre, le lit confortable. La mise à disposition d'une carafe d'eau avec deux verres dans la chambre a été très appréciée."
Nous n'avons vu YuChen qu'une seule fois à notre arrivée,et il a été très discret tout au long de notre séjour. Toutefois,les instructions pour le check-in et le check-out étaient précises,ce qui est appréciable,"et nous n'avons jamais eu l'impression d'être livrés à nous-mêmes. Tous ces éléments combinés ont sans aucun doute contribué à rendre notre séjour à Boston agréable !\"",
5085125,68694055,2016-04-06,51570459,Om,YuChen was really helpful and friendly. His place is close to the T subway Greeb line which makes transport a breeze.

I do like the location as well, in the mid of college environment and many easy-going restaurants. Though, the room I stayed located just next to the (very noisy) elevator...which may disturb someone who has sensitive sleep...but for me it was not that big deal."
5085125,70556455,2016-04-18,14484702,Chris,"Perfect if you want a place near BU. Quiet enough for me. Bed was comfortable. Clean enough considering you are sharing the bathroom with the hosts, whom I never saw. I actually preferred the privacy of never seeing anyone, so this worked out great. It's an older building, and not at all cute or hip or anything like that, but it's fine for place to sleep."
5085125,72006348,2016-04-30,57695312,Ayaka,Yu Chen was a wonderful host.
He's place's location was close to station and conbinient,every room was clean,very cozy,made me relax.,,

We made sure to remove our shoes at the front door to respect their house. Would definitely stay again without hesitation."
5085125,84228121,2016-07-06,25670696,Joe,Yu-Chen's place was exactly as advertised.  Very convenient to most of Boston and close to public transport.  He was friendly and helpful.

The room was clean and the apartment located close to a T station going directly to the city center of Boston. Thanks Yu Chen for letting us stay at your place, I would recommend it to all :)"
5085125,85695221,2016-07-12,16105254,Felix,Place was very clean and cozy. Although in an older building we had no issues with the accommodations. It was in a nice neighborhood with easy access to public transportation. T was about 2 blocks away. A few nice restaurants and coffee shops were within walking distance. Hosts made us feel comfortable although we rarely saw them. Very nice experience! Would recommend to anyone traveling to Boston!

5085125,87814519,2016-07-21,33315892,April,We came to Boston for a very quick little trip and were looking for an affordable and accessible place to stay. The apartment is right next to public transportation which was really nice. Pretty good price considering the location and it wasn't anything fancy but a bed and shower was really all we needed!
We did not see yu-Chen because our visit was so short but he sent me a nice text message welcoming us with directions to get inside.,,,,,
Only downside which I'm surprised nobody mentioned- incredibly loud banging noise behind the bedroom wall!! I believe it was the elevator. If you are a light sleeper,you may want to look elsewhere or maybe bring earplugs!,,,,

5085125,89534968,2016-07-29,74794707,Daniel,"Perfect location if you go to Boston by car,lots of parking spots nearby and a good connection to the center,would come back any time."

5085125,90725246,2016-08-02,83147944,Natasha,"Yu-Chen was very helpful and accommodating during our Boston trip, and he explained the check-in process well. He was always available to communicate with, and his roommate was very nice and helpful also.  He provided helpful information, such as transit maps, guidebooks, wifi information, and instructions about the place. It was quiet (except for the elevator which freaked me out sometimes) and a great place to stay near transit, universities, and places to eat. I felt very safe walking around the area in the evening, and it seemed to be a very student-centric place with people around at all times."
5085125,91471373,2016-08-05,81712999,Jason,"We were in Boston to see Boston so we only needed a good lace to sleep. Very small college dorm like place which was fine for the type of traveling we did. There is no TV, which was nice as we did more around town."
Getting to the Green Line or bicycle Hubway was very easy just a couple of blocks away. Took us 15-20 min to get to down town Boston. We were right by Boston University so lots of things close. We rented bikes on the Hubway and rode to Harvard and MIT.,,,,,
"Wireless internet was available and super fast. We never saw our host which was fine for us.\"",,,,,

5085125,94530979,2016-08-16,35463234,Shaun,"The experience was perfect. No complaints at all. My friend and I were in town for the weekend for a conference and Yu-Chen's place was located in the perfect area for that. We didn't have a whole lot of downtime to explore the area, but there were plenty of good food spots around, coffee shops, etc. Everything we could have needed was close by, and better yet, our conference was within walking distance (20-25 minutes) from his place."
We weren't there often,and didn't interact with Yu-Chen a whole lot during our stay,but he was very kind the entire time,provided us with everything on the listing,and even offered us a transit card the first day we were in town. He asked on more than one occasion if everything was good,and provided me with an extra outlet when I needed to use my computer for work. The apartment and room was also very comfortable.
Taking into account the location,"the rate was exceptional. I'd recommend anyone who's looking to stay in the area to check out Yu-Chen's place in the future. It'll be well worth it.\"",,,,

Yu Chen is a nice host, he gives good and very helpful advice about Boston. No complaint for anything. The private bedroom, dining area, bath room and kitchen are clean. Yu Chen also allowed me to leave my luggage at his place after my check in time. Totally recommended!!"
5085125,94906337,2016-08-17,79123139,George,Didnt get to meet Yu Chen but he left clear and great instructions and communicated brilliantly. Good air con in the room too and in a good location in allston.

5085125,98402285,2016-08-30,14105586,Justin,"Yuchen was nice and easy to reach.  His place is pretty much exactly as advertised.  The building is kind of like a giant grimy undergraduate dorm, but his apartment is clean."

We were a little hesitant about sleeping there after that. The apartment was a bit dirty, missing garbage bags and the amenities were lacking (no toothpaste)."
The building was nice as well,however the check in process was mechanical. No answers to questions,just a copy + paste statement to any communication. Despite the apartment having some nice,modern features,"I would likely would not choose to stay here again.\"",

The place was clean and well-stocked, and I enjoyed the location in East Boston because it allowed me to see another side of this diverse city, and it's a neighborhood that really feels like a community. Also, it's an easy subway ride to other areas, and extremely convenient in relation to the airport - a 10-minute walk from the airport subway station to her door."

The seperate bathroom and toilet shared with others in the house was generally available and was clean and suitable. Other areas in the house were less so but really we spent time in our room so this was less important. Dan proved to be a thoughtful host even offering honey lime syrup tea to ease coughing and a sore throat. She also provides small snacks and bottled water. Walking distance to the T and free airport shuttle and good bar and restaurant makes this location really good.

11333422,93125397,2016-08-11,86267098,Sebastian,"she answered my questions immediately, all of them.that was very nice.  She even answered questions about the neighbourhood."
11333422,94373195,2016-08-15,72524440,Kari Ella,"\"The room was very convenient for my first visit to Boston, as I needed to return a rental car to the airport and fly out early the second morning. It was clean, spacious, cool (nice A/C unit) during a heat wave, and in a lovely neighborhood. Vu, Dan's husband, was very nice and friendly, and helped me with my luggage. (It's a third floor walk-up.) There is a large TV with Netflix and a fridge in the hallway with drinks and snacks for guests. It was no problem that the living room and kitchen were \"\"off limits\"\" (there are two photos of the kitchen in the listing"
11333422,96045134,2016-08-21,70130294,Michael,"The location was great for Dan's place. I loved being only 10 minutes from the train station that also had a shuttle bus to the airport. I was able to use the train station to get everywhere without having to use Uber. While the room was very clean, the bathroom, hallway, and the rest of the house were very cluttered. Also, this is on the third floor so it was very warm in the house so they provide an in room air conditioner, which is very loud (even on lowest setting) making it difficult to sleep and it is too hot to turn it off. It was good experience though as everything else was great. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. They also provided everything I needed including water bottles and towels. I never interacted with them after check in so I had a lot of privacy."
4287348,22480435,2014-11-07,23311072,Annie,"This was a great place to stay. Courtney was flexible on arrival and check out times- she let me leave my bag at her place so I didn't have to haul it through the city before my evening flight. Courtney was also really helpful with suggestions in places to eat and things to do in her neighborhood, as well as getting around. The apartment was super cute and very comfortable feeling. It was a quick walk to the T, and maybe a 15$ cab to the more central part of Boston. Overall the stay was very comfortable and easy. I would definitely stay with Courtney again and recommend this stay to all."
4287348,22992424,2014-11-19,11423138,Alex,"Courtney is a great host, and easily available. The appartment is centrally located, easy to find, and quite clean."

4287348,28935849,2015-04-01,9978015,Gina,"Had a good stay with Courtney. She was a very nice host - flexible, and helpful with questions about the neighborhood. The location is only a  20 min walk from the new convention center and goes through South Boston so its easy to shop or eat on the way. Her dog is small and very friendly.  The place is nicely furnished and the shared bath was reasonably clean.  The downsides are there is no internet and the room is really tiny with almost no place to put clothes."
4287348,29778696,2015-04-12,30168274,Jan,"Courtney made me feel very welcome , with communication before I arrived and very clear instructions on how to enter her apartment."
I loved the location,few mins walk to a beautiful sandy beach,close to shops and cafes and walkable to the conference centre where I was going. The apartment is beautiful and has a great outdoor deck. I met Courtney on the second evening and she was very welcoming and friendly. Cute little dog was home too.,,,
Thankyou Courtney,"I would definitely stay again!\"",,,,
4287348,30485241,2015-04-22,19052471,Larry,Courtney accommodated my hectic conference schedule by letting me check in late and also keeping in contact with me via the messaging service during the day of my arrival.

"\"",,,,,
4287348,30747494,2015-04-26,31822114,Scott,"Courtney was an excellent host. She and her dog were waiting to greet me at arrival. The apartment bedroom was comfortable and well decorated, and the location was very convenient to Carson Beach, where I was in Boston to run in the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's 5K to raise awareness of this incurable blood cancer and funds for research into new treatments and an eventual cure. I was so glad to find this accommodation option!"

Though I didn't spend much time in the area around the apartment itself, there was quite a bit within easy walking distance. Distance to the T station at Andrew is easy to get to and you're downtown before you know it. Courtney herself was very laid back and relaxed, a great hostess."
4287348,34417553,2015-06-08,10179373,Sylvie,"Courtney's place is lovely decorated and clean, in a quiet neighbourhood, at walking distance form the Massachussets Convention Center and close to the subway."

The neighborhood is walking distance for food etc. I took an UberX car when I needed to go farther than a mile or so. For Internet, I used the Xfinity wifi with no problem (~$10/day and $20/week, I think)."

It's close to all you need in southie (Beach, Dinners and even bowling) and just a bit of travel from central Boston. Courtey helped me out with all my questions and was very helpful. The dog is amazing, quiet and very friendly (this comes from a cat person...)"
4287348,38274753,2015-07-14,33451726,Rachel,Courtney was very welcoming and great to communicate with. She even gave me tips on the best way to get to the apartment using public transportation and good places to get breakfast. The room was exactly as described and in a handy location to where I needed to be. No complaints in anyway. Would stay again if I ever get to find myself in Boston again.
4287348,43487681,2015-08-20,33819567,David,This was my first experience with airbnb and it was definitely positive. I came for a conference at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center and this was a convenient 25 minute walk from there through nice neighborhoods. Courtney was very pleasant to speak with and offered me advice on transportation around the city. I would recommend this location to my friends and family with no hesitation.
4287348,45813730,2015-09-06,38237268,David,"My host was not present during my trip, but she left the key for me in an easily accessible location and left out a towel and toiletries.  The neighborhood was good and the room was comfortable. Overall a very positive experience."

She's very inviting and a lovely host. Seems open to sharing kitchen and other aspects of the apartment if you need it. Her dog is great, basically sleeps in his bed most of the evening. Southie is tough to park in."

When I first arrived, I was a little nervous about the area since I haven't traveled to Boston but after talking with Courtney, I felt completely safe. I did a lot of walking at all hours of the day in the neighborhood and noticed a lot of people out as well. There were a couple times I was lost or needed a dinner recommendation and all I had to do was text Courtney - she replied quickly and had great recommendations. I would highly recommend this room!"

Hardly had chance to speak to Courtney but she was helpful and obliging and gave me good directions for getting downtown. The accommodation was clean and tidy, and had everything I could wish for during a short stay. It was situated in a quiet residential area which was convenient for Central Boston."

The apartment was comfortable and had all the luxurious of your own home - including laundry!  The only thing is that the location isn't great - it's a ~15 minute walk to the nearest T stop.  Besides that, there are great restaurants and stores nearby, just depends where in the city you need to go."
4287348,71458705,2016-04-25,31113666,Rachael,"I had a wonderful time staying at Courtney's apartment! It was beautifully decorated, very clean, and the whole apartment felt inviting and cozy. Courtney and her dog were both great hosts, and never made me feel uncomfortable or unwanted. She even provided towels and small toiletries. I was here for Pax East, and the Convention Center was only about a 20 minute walk from her apartment. Uber rides were never more than $8. The only thing that I would forewarn is that the stairs to get to her apartment are a little narrow, but other then that, the place was great. If I am ever back in the Boston area, I will definitely stay at her place again."
4287348,80254544,2016-06-17,27057569,Jonathan,I loved my stay at Courtney's house. She was such a friendly host. She was super helpful with giving me recommendations for things to see in Boston.

L'appartement situé à une dizaine de minutes à pieds de l'arrêt du T le plus proche (Andrew) est dans un quartier résidentiel très agréable.,,,,,
Ayant séjourné à Boston durant quelques jours très chaud (près de 45°C de ressenti de température),je peux dire que l'air conditionné chez Courtney marche parfaitement et est relativement silencieux,ce qui est confortable.,,,

13041602,75253583,2016-05-20,3138427,Sandra,"This place was a little gem.  It was a last minute decision to book in as we had an appointment at Dana Farber and I didn't want to have to drive.  This location is a 2 minute walk to the bus and train station.  There is a great coffee shop around the corner as well as some good restaurants.  We loved Dogwood and the grass fed burger place.  The host, Hannah, was a delight.  Helpful and friendly as well as respectful of our privacy.  Home is clean and well furnished.  Kitchen has everything you need.  Bedroom quiet with queen bed and comfortable bedding.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
13041602,75497230,2016-05-21,49873446,Ken,"Hannah makes you feel welcome, is helpful, kind, attentive  and considerate. Her place is in a great location that's very close to public transportation (train) and shops and restaurants. And its a good deal. I would recommend it."

13041602,76269272,2016-05-26,40102474,Xin,"Very good!. Hannah is very nice! She greeted us very warmly! She had offered some snacks and coffee! She also had made us some home-made bread, which is very delicious. The house is very clean and quiet. The location is very good! It takes only 2-3 minutes to walk to the metro. And it take about 20 minutes to travel to downtown area. I really enjoy staying in this place."
13041602,76393948,2016-05-27,50950660,Nafisa,"Hannah was a fantastic host! She wasn't there during our stay, but that posed no problem at all, because her instructions were very clear for the duration of our stay. The location is fantastic and so conveniently close to public transportation. The room itself is also very comfortable. Altogether a fantastic stay."
13041602,76778955,2016-05-29,64305772,Yuchen,Great clean quiet place. Everything needed was provided. Place is near the metro and very convenient. Most importantly the host is both friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended.
13041602,77613857,2016-06-02,43121787,Richard,"Hannah was great from start to finish, made us feel at ease. Room was quite and comfortable. Flat was just what we were after, easy commute to central Boston. Great independent Local shops. Would recommend anyone going to stay a few days in Boston. Thanks Hannah."
13041602,79084723,2016-06-11,40163998,Monica,"We enjoyed our stay at Hannah's. Although the place was a good 20-minute train ride to Boston, Hannah made the kitchen, living room and porch accessible to us. The room was big enough and it was clean. I'm glad I saw another part of Boston I didn't know."
13041602,79953022,2016-06-15,22260964,Michael,Hannah’s apartment is indeed a gem:
Easily no more than a 1-2 minute walk to the orange line subway station,which is only 5 short stops to the Back Bay area and a few more short stops to the center of downtown Boston. Takes no more than 15 minutes to downtown once the subway departs this location. There also multiple bus routes that originate from this station,including one that runs directly to the Boston College area. Also,within half a block are several fantastic and diverse restaurants (Brassica Café a definite ‘must try’ – the charred octopus seaweed tagliatella alone is worth a visit!). And only one subway stop down is another fantastic area of Jamiaca Plain with more coffee shops and some fantastic little cafes and restaurants.,,
The apartment itself is exactly as pictured and is wonderfully quiet and clean. Hannah has all the amenities clearly labeled and a clear,explicit set of instructions with general guide to the area are plainly marked on the dining room table. I only had the opportunity to meet Hannah briefly unfortunately as schedules were quite busy,but communication via email/text was always immediate and responsive. And as other reviewers have mentioned,trust that Hannah will more than likely have something baking with a fantastic aroma that permeates the entire apartment – the banana bread was indeed most delicious! I will most assuredly be checking the availability calendar at Hannah’s apartment on my frequent visits to Boston.,,

13041602,87188588,2016-07-19,73198063,Ricardo,"Boston is a great city, I liked it very much. Jamaica plain neighborhood is so quiet, and safe. The public transportation is efficient, so you are able to move from one place to another easily. You cannot miss Jamaica Pond, it is beautiful, tranquil, and it takes 10 minutes to get there. The host, Hannah, is so warm, patient and hospitable. I really enjoyed talking with her, and her company. In general, I can said I received more than I expected."
13041602,87902103,2016-07-22,77018202,Mary,"Hannah's Airbnb was my first experience with Airbnb and it was everything I hoped it would be and more.  Hannah provided everything we needed in a clean and organized home.  Her home is a two minute walk to the subway which is a great way to get around Boston.  My daughter and I enjoyed our stay and when we return to Boston with the rest of our family, we will contact Hannah first."
13041602,88862703,2016-07-25,69243825,Zaïda,"Het verblijf bij Hannah was precies wat we nodig hadden! Nog geen 3 minuten lopen van de Subway en je bent meteen waar je wil zijn.

Hannah donne rapidement les informations nécessaires avant notre arrivée,ce qui est rassurant lorsque nous préparons le voyage. L'appartement d'Hannah était très bien, propre, agréable et vraiment à 3-4 min du métro donc super pour les déplacements. Même si nous n'avons pas pu beaucoup parler à Hannah car nous visitions beaucoup en peu de temps, nous savions qu'elle serait disponible à la moindre question. Nous recommandons avec mon ami sans problème !"
13041602,91355440,2016-08-05,20655529,Adrianne,"We had a lovely time staying at Hannah's!  Our room was clean, private (although no lock) and right next to the T...very convenient!  Hannah was very easy to reach.  Highly recommended!"
13041602,92222774,2016-08-08,19539447,Chen,Hannah is very responsive and helpful. The location is great: a couple minutes to the orange line and half an hour away from downtown Boston. We loved our stay there and would highly recommend it to other people.
13041602,92668623,2016-08-09,3084581,Dorothee,"We had a great time at Hannah's place. Fine room and bed and we could make use of kitchen, living room, bathroom and porch. The house is ideally located. The metro is almost next door. Shops, restaurants and nice parks within walking distance. Unfortunately we didn't meet Hannah during our stay."
13041602,94949692,2016-08-17,85860556,Jason,"I quite enjoyed my stay. Didn't get to meet Hannah, but she keeps a nice house. Room was quiet and well-kept. Coming and going was easy and I would definitely stay again. PERFECT for those travelling by train!"
13041602,95501466,2016-08-20,75628796,Nikiwe,"Hannah was a great host and her home is lovely. It's located right at the end of the orange line, literally a 2 minute walk from the station, so very convenient. Sadly we didn't get to meet Hannah in person but she was must helpful through messages and responded to our enquiries promptly. Would definitely stay again on future visits to Boston!"
4484798,30413759,2015-04-21,10792689,Marijn,"Located near metro station, on a quiet road. Within 15 minutes downtown."
Room is spacious and the duvet was clean,but the room is dusty (floor) and the mattress hard.,,,,
The bathroom and kitchen are terribly filthy and for that reason we would not recommend it.,,,,,
Probably everyone that stayed here,left there stuff (what became terribly dirty and is not cleaned at all).,,,,
The hostess is very nice,but maybe has a different view about cleaning.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4484798,32642382,2015-05-19,22308553,Marie-Anne,We didn't see our host. A very friendly man was there to welcome us.
4484798,32848937,2015-05-22,23510651,Hannah,Clean and comfortable stay.
4484798,33314274,2015-05-26,32587027,Maria,"Die Beschreibung von Lage, Anfahrtsmöglichkeiten war relativ genau, die Schlüsselübergabe hat geklappt."
4484798,34062456,2015-06-04,30716273,Shuang,I will not recommend this room for many reasons.
First,the bed squeaks,loudly! The bed is full size I believe. The springs inside the mattress kept me awake all night. The pillow,sheet and quilt is not very clean as you can smell something you don't want to. The floor is unbelievable dirty! No one have never cleaned it. If your cloth drops on the floor,when you pick it up,you will see dirt.
No AC,no fans in the room. I was there 9 nights. First 5 nights,the room temp was 85! The other 4 nights,it was 55! And the quilt is so thin. It was too cold,I have to wear all my cloth so I can sleep a little.,
No three pin power outlet in the room,I couldn't charge my computer!!!!!! wifi in this room is very weak,you can't even open (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN),you have to go to the kitchen if you want to use wifi. Sound proofing of the room is very bad. You can hear everything if you know what I mean.,,
There are 4 rooms in the house to share one bath. There is a trash can in the bath and someone will come here clean it every many days! It can be very full and smells!,,,,,
Overall speaking. The house is close to the Red line,the neighborhood is okay. But,the room is just not very good. So,if you really care about the bed,the sanitation of the room,"I suggest you go somewhere else.\""
4484798,34669041,2015-06-10,34665111,Compa Kat,"Wonderful neighborhood, the subway is really near from the house, and everything is so close. The house is very quiet and the guest was very nice with us. I felt so comfortable and the place is so cozy, best time in Boston."
4484798,46667852,2015-09-12,42995328,Daniel,"Overall Orchid is and has been an excellent host. I stayed during the Labor Day weekend and in a pinch needed to extend my stay for work. The room is clean, nice private space and usage of the kitchen and fridge was lovely. The space is right next to the T train so it was easy to get to work or to see sites around Boston. Overall I would recommend staying here and I have already recommended using Airbnb more to friends because of my stay! Thank you thank you thank you!"
4484798,51158273,2015-10-18,44169305,垚,虽然不是市中心但是坐地铁非常方便
4484798,52365823,2015-10-28,30360411,Evan,"Quiet, sufficient, just needed a place for 4days.  No problems."
4484798,68581454,2016-04-05,57180500,Maria,This room has a great location since it's close enough to the T station (about 2 blocks away).  The room is spacious and the bed is clean. My recommendation for the owner is to improve the cleaning of the bathroom and make the kitchen smell better. Although there are small issues l think it's still a good cheap option in Boston.
4484798,70605849,2016-04-18,953717,Johnny,"Stayed here during the Boston Marathon. The host was easy to reach and the location is fairly close to downtown area. The train is also close by. Since we drove, it was only 10 minutes or less into central Boston. Parking did became a bit harder at night due to residential regulations, but it didn't take long to find the both nights we were there."
Things that we weren't aware of was the condition of the rest of the house not pictured in any of the photos. The bathroom and kitchen was unlike any other of the airbnb we stayed at. It was not clean at all and is poorly maintained. As an honest review,we did not feel at home like we normally would in a clean and maintained airbnb we have stayed in the past. Although the bedroom was fairly clean and bed was acceptable. There is a lot of creaking in the hardwood floor when you walk around. Other guests walking around throughout the night can be heard. There is also a weird odor coming from the kitchen area every time you walk in.,,,,
This would be a great place to stay,"but there are still a few issues to be addressed to be a recommended airbnb. \"",,,,
4484798,76420071,2016-05-27,72368311,Manimaran,Place is very convenient to red line.
4484798,77129373,2016-05-30,56894145,Minh,Orchid is a great host and the house had everything i needed. It is great for the weekend. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very spacious.
4484798,79964108,2016-06-15,49511133,Jade,"My mum and I stayed here for about a week. We just wanted to start of by saying that we aren't crazy and high demanding people. First, we booked this room but the owner was about to let us stay downstairs in an uglier room without asking us. Second, the apartment had an uncomfortable odor that we had to buy candles on the first night there because we couldn't stand the smell. Also, the kitchen was dirty, and both the floor and bed were dusty. The bathroom was a mess with random things made as decorations. The owner didn't give us enough toilet papers to use so we had to use tissues and napkins. At night, it got so dark that we couldn't be able to see so when we left the apartment in the afternoon, we had to leave the lights in the hallway on. The owner was uncomfortable with that which was just ridiculous. We've been to so many Airbnb apartments with the same price before and they were all much higher quality. We will not recommend this place at all. It was the worst experience of Airbnb that we've ever had."
4484798,81443592,2016-06-23,68018666,Stefan,"Nice host, nice room! We can really recommend that spot in boston! Thx for everything!"
4484798,97499860,2016-08-27,40091805,Joseph,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5768195,30461732,2015-04-22,535391,Dustin,"Caitlin and her roommate Emily were excellent and kind hosts. They graciously opened up their entire apartment to my girlfriend and I for Boston marathon weekend. The location was perfect, close to great restaurants, as well as the T metro, and less than a mile to Boston Common. The apartment was clean, fresh linens, and sheets provided, as well as fun snacks, and post race refreshments! Both Caitlin and Emily were available via phone and email to answer any questions and help with anything. The laundromat right next door is nice to have, and the staff are very friendly. I highly recommend staying at their place!"
9998187,58735559,2016-01-03,48012064,Wallace,Victor is an excellent host who made me feel welcome and ensured that I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. He communicated well and availed himself for any issues. I would gladly lodge at his place if I'm back in Boston.
9998187,60219605,2016-01-20,52610574,Bingzhao,"Victor is so GREAT! I must say he is the best host i have seen. He is really helpful. Before i arrived Boston, he contacted me to ask if i need any help to get his place. When i get there, he personally welcomed us. The room is great and the bed is cozy. His roommates are very friendly. The location is great. Train is just in front of the house."
"Great place to stay.\"",,,,,
9998187,60362823,2016-01-22,52862297,Shuang,"nice room,nice roommates!The apartment is cozy and the traffic is convenient!The roommates are very warm heart,thanks alot!"
9998187,61009476,2016-01-30,18523935,Kaci,"Victor and his housemate Fernando were great hosts. We really enjoyed their company. The room was perfect for our needs. They laid out towels and chocolates on the bed with some soap. The room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. There were a lot of hangers, 2 sets of drawers for storage and a shoe rack. There is a tv mounted to the wall with an HDMI cable. The bathroom was also very clean. My mother was in the hospital and their place was close enough that we could walk to it. It was an excellent price for staying in Boston as well."
9998187,62640650,2016-02-15,58054446,William,Victor was a very good host. The room was clean and had all of the amenities that I could have asked for. The proximity to the T line was very convenient as well.
In quality alone I would give it a 4 star,but the extremely affordable price for what you got makes this a 5 star stay.,,,,
Tip: Parking is tough to find (it is Boston anyways),so I would really encourage travelers to park there car there when a spot opens up and then use the mass transit system during your visit. If you leave for the day,"you might have trouble finding a spot when you get back.\"",,,
9998187,79269738,2016-06-12,6693748,Dagmar,"Fernando was friendly and helpful. Bedroom was big enough, good and clean bed. Enough space for stuff. The Location in Boston was also fine, Close to tram, cabs available, some nice bars in walking distance. We felt welcome - there was a small piece of chocolate for each guest and clean towels prepared."
The bathroom and kitchen cleanliness could be much better. Definitely no bugs but both rooms were not cleaned for a while. It looked like noone feel responsible for. Funny as the bedroom was (URL HIDDEN) we only used the kitchen for a small breakfast.,,,,,
Main issue was parking. There is absolutely NO parking nearby. We got one ticket due to false parking and the other night our car was towed. So if you go there NO CAR!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9998187,79919232,2016-06-15,70182732,Satyam,It was my first time in Boston and Fernando really helped in making a very good experience. He is a good host. Room was clean with fresh towels and essentials given as soon as i arrived. Safe area and riverway station is down the corner. Fernando was available everytime whenever I needed his assistance.
9998187,82747338,2016-06-29,77037408,David,Convenient location next to the T! Fernando was super friendly and accommodating of our needs.
9998187,95141198,2016-08-18,74625471,Sahil,"I had a good experience at Fernando's place. Even though he was out of town, he ensured that I have a smooth stay. The apartment's top quality is its location, right in front of the T (Riverway Station). Perfect for those, who like me, are working in the Longwood area and are looking for a short term accommodation."
6089975,34244243,2015-06-06,34303346,Ishi,"The apartment is really nice and clean and well equipped. The building and the neighborhood is safe, nice and a huge selection of bars, restaurants and shops are just a few minutes of walk from it. The light rail stops in front of the house which makes it very convenient to access the downtown, but if you're up to some exercise and want to get to Cambridge, it's a nice walk."
There is really one downside,the noise from the light rail which operates till late,so you better equip yourself with some earplugs. Apart from this,the place is absolutely recommended.,,
Communication with Eric was pretty easy,he responded quickly,and he was flexible to accommodate my late arrival and early departure to arrange to key transfer.,,,
"\"",,,,,
6089975,38087502,2015-07-12,5173430,Shayne,Eric was very easy to communicate with and fast with his responses. The space was clean and comfortable. Would recommend.
6089975,45334125,2015-09-01,10041771,Jiaxun,This studio is really clean and have convenience location. The train is just in walkable distance. Eric is really flexible about check in and check out time which helped me a lot for my first day in Boston. The bed is really comfortable and the sheets are clean. Although it might be a little bit noisy because of the train during the night; it is bearable.
6089975,46542110,2015-09-11,8872372,Scott,Eric's place is great. It was clean and had a great cafe and store across the street. Also very convenient to the train.  The air conditioner and street were both a bit noisy. Might be a little too much for a real light sleeper but was fine for me.
6936712,39538537,2015-07-24,2000594,Evan,Anne was a terrific and very responsive host who met me at the building to check in. She was communicative throughout the week. The space itself was perfect and very unique - a small studio perfect for long days and sleeping. It has a lot of cool details like a Murphy bed and a rain shower and is in a historic and quiet building. Central to everything in Beacon Hill. I would stay at one of the properties Anne manages again in a heartbeat.
6936712,41475054,2015-08-07,1109876,Alexis,"The studio was pretty small but clean, the flat is very conveniently located and the rooftop offers amazing sunset view"
6936712,43431982,2015-08-19,24383546,Adam,Awesome little place in a great location. Has everything you need right there in the studio and the secure building is a great plus. Minutes away from a walk through the commons or great restaurants. Highly recommended for anyone needing a home away from home in Boston. Anne was also very easy to coordinate with. Thanks!!
6936712,81066197,2016-06-20,2364057,Irene,"I loved the location of this place.  It is right next to Boston Common, so it was so refreshing being able to walk through the park everyday."
The apt is quite small,but is very well decorated,and has everything you need.  It is perfect for one person.,,,
I LOVE the shower.  Great water pressure.,,,,,
Anna is responsive,and she also let me check in earlier.,,,,
I did feel that the apt could have been a little cleaner,as it did feel stuffy and was a lil dusty.,,,,
But I would stay there again.,,,,,

Do-it-yourself check-in and check-out extremely smart and easy. When we needed assistance, we had immediate response from Inn Boston Reservation efficient staff."
Only problem we had was rain coming into the flat from the roof,one day (also promptly repaired the following day).,,,,
"I would definitely consider it again for a next visit in Boston\"",,,,,
10569282,75421412,2016-05-21,27326557,Susie,The apartment was beautiful! It's in a perfect location and we couldn't have been more pleased. Thank you so much for making our trip to Boston so memorable.
10569282,76518448,2016-05-27,51939475,Elina,Pros:
1. Location,location,location! This neighbourhood is incredible- made me want to move to Boston!,,,
2. The hosts have a pack and play available (a big plus when travelling with an infant),,,,,
3. The apartment is relatively clean and nicely decorated,,,,,
4. Had a good quality inflatable mattress in the closet,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
1. Looks NOTHING like the pictures (a total scam),,,,,
2. loud AC,"",,,,
"3. no widows in 2 of the 3 the bedrooms (so technically can't be considered \"\"bedrooms\"\")",,,,,
4. weak wifi connection,,,,,

10569282,81018325,2016-06-20,26447346,Diana,"When we arrived at the apartment that we originally booked (6F) we were received with the news that it wasn't available! We were offered a partial refund for the days that the unit wouldn't  be available. The unit that the Inn gave us was nice but a little dark, and the upper rooms smaller and hotter (2F). Gladly we were provided with fans! Both units were very clean and enough toiletries were provided. The washing machine worked but the drying machine did not. The building has steep stairs but also has an elevator. The only problem with the elevator is that if one of the doors of the other floors is not properly closed, it won't work, so one has to go check every floor to make sure the doors are closed... a bit of a hazzle. The unit pictured here is very bright and comfortable. I highly recommend it! The Inn main office is a little bit far by walking with your suitcases if one ever needs to storage them. Even though we had a little of a rough start, the Inn Boston staff was always very polite, attentive and easy to reach. The neighborhood is marvelous!! It is colorful, clean, safe and pintoresque. A park is just a couple of steps away, and a metro station close by! The building is definitely perfectly located. If you are planning on having the perfect trip at Boston, don't hesitate and book at the Inn!"
10569282,81533804,2016-06-23,54645694,David,"We had a great stay at the apartment on beacon street in Boston. The apartment was a great size, clean and well stocked with towels and linens. The two bathrooms were great and very clean. The location was perfect.. 5mins walk from the freedom trail and the park. Also 2 mins from The Cheers Bar for a cold pint of Blue Moon."

10569282,86479646,2016-07-16,11794303,Simon,Der Code für die Eingangstüren funktionierte einwandfrei. Das beste an diesem Apartment ist definitiv die Lage. In höchstens 15 Minuten ist man zu Fuss bei praktisch jeder Sehenswürdigkeit. Boston Common und die Newbury Street sind gleich um die Ecke.
Zwei der drei Schlafzimmer sind eher klein,zwei grosse Koffer hatten nur knapp oder gar keinen Platz. Ausserdem kann man die Fenster nicht wirklich abdunkeln was dazu führte,dass es bereits um 5 Uhr morgens sehr hell war im Zimmer.,,,

You can even control the temperatures of the house on it!  The stay was very comfortable with huge rooms and offered everything 8 girls needed.  The location is about 15-20 minutes from downtown Boston.  The best way and cheapest to get around was using the Uber app (approx $20 to dt).  We didn't use the subway about it was about a 10 minute walk away.  Must do is Fenway tour and see Quincy market!

With a group of 7, it was great to have a larger house for all of us to stay so comfortably; the bedrooms had great views over Dorchester and were very nicely furnished. The property is about a 5-10 minute walk from the T stop, which made it very easy for us to navigate the city during the busy July 4 weekend, and the off-street parking prevented any late-night parking headaches in a neighborhood. It was very helpful also to have a house fully stocked with not only linens, but also things like laundry detergent, dish soap, and toilet paper.

530983,73817139,2016-05-10,68544844,Rebecca,"Great place - as advertised! The home is a ~200 year old Victorian full of history and charm, and has the best views of the whole neighborhood - from the back windows on the second floor you can see the ocean. Very quiet area, but easy to get downtown to all the touristy stuff.  Little swingset for the kids in the back, too. Off-street parking was a real plus, and nearby restaurants (great Indian place around the corner) and CVS very helpful. Quick 10 minutes to the Savin Hill T line, but for our group of four, it was actually cheaper to take a 15-minute, $7.00 Uber to the downtown area. Sure beats driving and parking! The house itself was clean, clean, clean --and I am a clean freak so meeting my standards is no easy task. The place is also HUGE, and there is another rental up above in a separate condo (which was empty when we were there) so if you had a really large group you could rent the two separate parts of the home (each with own entrance) and probably fit 14 people! Beds were comfortable, and plenty of towels. The home is historic (except the modern kitchen and baths), so the floors are a little creaky and some of the plaster is showing its age, but that only added to the charm, in our opinion. Swank Properties folks jumped on all our questions and made check in and out a breeze. I'd stay with them again, here or at another property. Great service and communication!"

530983,81357209,2016-06-22,64876351,Jordan,"This home away from home was the perfect place for our trip. We had a group of 6 people of all ages, and there was more than plenty of space for all of us. Very reasonably priced for the space and location. Next time I go to the Boston area, I plan to stay here again. The only small concern we had with the place was the rug in the dining room. It was very slick against the floor and nearly every time someone walked to the table with food, they would have to catch their balance. Definitely a minor issue, just more of a concern for people staying in the future. Otherwise perfect!"
530983,86771304,2016-07-17,6445768,Ming Ju,"This property has a ver professional set up, it is managed by a group an professional real estate. It is clean & convenient. We are very enjoy to stay here ."
530983,93950678,2016-08-14,21925189,Sonja,Lance and his team made everything super easy from check in to check out. I was so happy with this lovely house - and so were the other eight guests! It's in a great location and the size is perfect for reunions. I will definitely recommend this home to anyone who is looking to vacay in Boston.
530983,95006366,2016-08-18,72139082,Alessandro,"Casa in legno meravigliosa, arredata con gusto  e dotata di tutti i confort. Addirittura migliore rispetto alle foto sul sito. Metropolitana a quattro passi in zona tranquilla e residenziale. Bellissima, consiglio!"

This was my first airbnb experience staying with a host and it was a great experience!  Our schedules worked quite well,whereby,we were never in each others way,had great conversations when we were together including a fantastic evening where Siqi made a most loved homemade dinner.,,
The space is exactly as the photos depict and the room itself is really roomy with good natural light.,,,,,
The neighborhood has a lot of character,there is an amazing bakery,Canto 6 that I found myself at every..morning..,,,
If you walk about 10',"you'll find yourself at Green St Orange Line station and public bike rentals.  Parking is EASY.  Super convenient transport.\"",,,,

8481291,70811599,2016-04-21,64766942,Wendelin,"I stayed at Siqi's for 10 days, which were simply great. Siqi's flat is beautifully decorated in a minimalist design. The place had a lovely atmosphere and I (as a father of three boys) very much enjoyed living  in a tidy environment. Siqi is a great cook, so his kitchen is well equipped with everything needed to prepare a nice meal. For me, Siqi was the ideal host. I went to Boston university (where I had an office), while he went to work. Weekdays, we only saw each other in the morning and in the evening. After the first couple of days, where he was on a business trip and we did not see each other, we had many interesting evening conversations that often nicely concluded the day. On the weekend, we went food shopping and he invited me to a BBQ that he had planned with some neighbors. It was a wonderful evening and a good opportunity to get to know locals.  It almost felt as if Siqi and I had been sharing flats for years."

583255,2642401,2012-10-17,3550668,Christine,"Me and my mum had a great stay in Valery's Apartment. It was our first airbnb experience and first time in Boston, but Valery was super helpful and made sure everything was very easy and convenient for us- providing us with lots of useful advice and suggestions of things to do and maps etc. The apartment was comfortable, clean and tidy and really well situated just a few minutes walk from a T stop. Valery is an excellent host- we would definitely stay at his place again, and I highly recommend it!"
583255,48804291,2015-09-28,44349528,Vikas,"Had an absolutely wonderful stay at Valery's place. He is a great, considerate host who has taken care of every little detail to make his guests feel completely at home and make their stay as comfortable as possible. Whether its from small conveniences like phone charges in every location one might need them in to a fully equipped kitchen with high quality appliances and equipment to a Bluetooth enabled sound bar connected to a phone with Spotify and TuneIn pre-loaded."
The apartment itself is very conveniently located close to the T and has useful convenience stores and restaurants within walking distance.,,,,,
Finally,Valery has been very very quick to respond to any questions etc - right from the first time I got in touch with him. Since he was away when I checked,he had even arranged for a friend to visit a bit later and show things around. It felt more like going to a friend's place and not to someone's who I have never met before. Couldn't have asked for a better first AirBnB experience !,,,
"Very highly recommended for anyone visiting the Boston area.\"",,,,,
583255,49265137,2015-10-02,37398540,Mark,Great place and great host!
Everything was perfect: the place was as described: clean,spacious and nice. The apartment is close to transportation and street parking is easy.,,,,
Valery is an available person: he answers emails/texts very quickly and is always nice and polite.,,,,,
I will not hesitate to recommend this place to any of my friends visiting Boston.,,,,,
"Thank you Valery!\"",,,,,
583255,50778785,2015-10-14,6784477,Marius,"What a fantastic place! I think as far as apartments in the Boston area go, this is as good a deal as you can find. It's located in a picturesque and safe neighborhood, pretty easy to get to (even at night), and the apartment is just stunningly beautiful. There are so many interesting things to discover and everything is so tasteful, that is was really too bad we did not get to meet Valery in person. He was really easy to communicate and coordinate with, too. There is no doubt that we would stay at his place again."
583255,51446562,2015-10-20,19065904,Tim,The place was great.  Very good location for our needs.  Some nice little touches with having a Charlie Card there for us to use for T line.  ( we needed to add $$ of course but I think I left a couple bucks on it for the next guy)  Well stocked kitchen with all the utensils and appliances you could need.   All in all very comfortable and convenient location. Only caveat is you can hear the people upstairs walking around.  Didn't bother me in the least and it's not that they were up all night dancing but if someone is a very light sleeper it may be an issue.
583255,52244627,2015-10-27,45140520,Jenevieve,"The pictures are very accurate. It was cozy, and very neat. The neighborhood is safe within walking distance to the green T line and also close to a nice small grocery store, pizza joint, and coffee shop. The host was attentive and left clear instructions."
583255,74797189,2016-05-16,64765405,Melissa,"Wonderful place in a great, safe, walkable neighborhood.  Easy access by foot, on the T, or by Uber/Lyft to most of the City.  Valery was great about communicating clearly and promptly, and making us feel welcome."

The place was exactly as advertised and was great place to stay, all the furnishings were newer and very nice.  We loved the massage chair!  We had a great time and was easy to get to the transit from the house."

The whole space is very high tech and fun. Massage chair is a must try. Best shower I've ever had with the 2 waterfall shower heads, steamer, and wall sprayers."
6089196,30836195,2015-04-27,6721333,Julie,The place is really clean and homey. Sarah is a gracious host who was very flexible and accommodated my schedule. The location is also so convenient -- close to the T and also the Boston Commons.
6089196,43309345,2015-08-18,40824352,Kristina,Sarah is a great host. The apartment is very cute and charming. The location is perfect and close to two subway stations. I highly recommend this location!
6089196,44246925,2015-08-24,41634662,Frank,This was our first time of using Airbnb so we were both a bit hesitant but it turned out perfectly.
The apartment was exactly as Louis and Sarah described in the ad. The Beacon Hill neighborhood made you feel like you were in a European country (I hadn't spent a lot of time in Beacon Hill but it is wonderful and am looking forward to going back),then to go up to the apt and see the cozy space furnished just like in the pictures was perfect. Great way to start our Airbnb experience.,,,,
The apartment is very nice,it is in a GREAT location,very close to North Station,the Boston Common,Faneuil Hall and the T stations.,
Louis was right on time to meet us with the keys,spent time discussing the apartment and gave us some ideas on where to get food,etc. (there is a decent store right around the corner).,,,
The towels were very nice,there was plenty of pressure for the shower,the bed was comfy,and the neighbors were not noisy. The apartment was clean,the furniture was comfortable and clean.,
They were flexible on our checkout time since we had a later train.,,,,,
We're looking forward to going back sometime in the future!!,,,,,

6089196,46195334,2015-09-08,9028426,Eddie,"Great host, Sarah was there to greet us and show us around the house.  Her responses to my questions were prompt.  Safe neighborhood and convenient location to be able to walk around Boston."
6089196,51450801,2015-10-20,10603230,Tim,"We enjoyed our stay here, the location is great.  Beacon Hill is a beautiful neighborhood and very central.  Nice shops, bars and restaurants, just down the hill on Charles st.  A mini-mart just on the corner for supplies, and a Whole Foods a little farther out for fancy full selection grocery store.  We were able to walk to the North End, Back Bay, etc."
I felt the communication with the host was very good,Sarah was very responsive throughout the entire process.  They were out of town when we arrived,but instructions were clear on how to gain access to the apartment.,,,
There were no surprises,the Apartment was as expected. It is a very old building with a lot of character and some expected quirks.  We found it well stocked,they had a nice selection of food for us in the fridge which was above and beyond what we expected.  There is an adequate selection of kitchen  equipment available to fix your own meals if so inclined.,,,
My twenty-something self would have been happy with the bed,but my current 50 yr old body was wanting something more plush.  It's basically a futon mattress,full size i guess (next size smaller than a Queen).  The floors are very squeaky,to be expected,I'm sure the people below could hear us on occasion,and we heard the people above us
6089196,51916523,2015-10-25,12260524,Pierre-Emmanuel,"Bien que n'ayant pas rencontré les prioritaires, nous avons été parfaitement guidé et aidé, très accommodants et soucieux de notre confort. L'appartement est merveilleusement situé dans le quartier Beacon Hill, très clair et surtout très calme. Douillet, agréable pour y passer un peu de temps et pour y cuisiner. A recommander."
6089196,54775398,2015-11-23,46545310,Suzanne,"Super hébergement !! Loger ici ajoute quelque chose à l'expérience de Boston, à mon avis. Le quartier a énormément de charme, et l'appartement également. Sarah a été très attentive à mon confort et accueillante. Elle m'a toujours répondu sans délai. J'ai également apprécié leur flexibilité quant à mes horaires d'arrivée et de départ. L'appartement avait tout le nécessaire, et beaucoup de guides très intéressants à regarder. J'étais à Boston pour une conférence alors j'ai peu visité, mais ça m'a clairement donné envie de revenir! Le quartier était tout à fait sûr et il y avait un petit magasin de produits de base juste à côté de l'appartement, ce qui est pratique quand on rentre tard et que les autres magasins ont fermé. La déco de l'appart est très sympa!"
Great accommodation! Staying in this apartment,I believe,adds to the whole Boston experience. The neighborhood has a ton of charm,and so does the flat. Sarah was attentive and welcoming. She always answered my messages without delay. I also appreciated that they were so flexible about my arrival and departure times. The apartment had everything needed,and many interesting travel guides to look at. I was in Boston for a conference so I didn't really visit,but it made me want to come back! The neighborhood was safe and there was a small shop for food very near
6089196,66420286,2016-03-22,13328265,Lars,"It's a nice, homely place in oldish Beacon Hill. Very helpful host. Great communication. Good laundry around the corner."
I stayed for a week in March and really enjoyed having Sarah's place as a base. I recommend going to Roxbury while in Boston.,,,,,

It's a great spot to walk anywhere in Boston! It was hard to leave this beautiful little 1 bedroom - and when we asked to extend our stay - Sarah was more than accommodating! I highly recommend this cozy, beautiful, awesome spot if you are in the Boston area."
6089196,69324152,2016-04-10,61385637,Sean,"Sarah was a great host and the listing was exactly as shown in the photos. She was very helpful when there was some initial confusion about the keys (totally my fault). Also, the neighborhood is really quite beautiful and quiet, but still in walking distance of many of Boston's major landmarks (Newbury St, the Boston Commons, the public library). It is really the perfect apartment for a nice getaway. Overall, it was a great place to stay and I would love to go back if I am in Boston again."
6089196,77278630,2016-05-31,69120335,Gee,"This apartment is in a great location within Beacon Hill- cute neighborhood, close to the Public Garden, and easy to walk around. Sarah was a kind host who welcomed us with some breakfast items she purchased. We enjoyed our stay."
6089196,79604719,2016-06-13,3258289,Matt,What a fabulous apartment in the middle of Beacon Hill - we were only a few blocks walk to Charles St. that offered up anything we could have needed. My wife and I were looking for the perfect weekend getaway and Sarah's place provided the perfect resting place. If only for the weekend we felt like locals among tourist in her quaint and wonderfully decorated apartment.

The home was exactly as described, very clean and cozy, perfect for a couple looking for a weekend getaway. The kitchen was loaded with cooking utensils, spices, fruit, etc. The neighborhood was perfect, it was less than ten minutes away (WALKING distance!) to many fun Boston spots, as well as a convenient MBTA station. I would love to stay here again if I were looking for a second Boston weekend getaway!"

4614037,36076831,2015-06-24,7779330,Misha,The host was extremely welcoming and hospitable!  I very much felt at home.  The place was spotless and very clean.  I was traveling from the West Coast and my flight was delayed; I ended up arriving to Boston at ~1am and she waited up for me to work out logistics.  I can't say enough about the host and my overall experience.
4614037,36252090,2015-06-26,28937340,Carolyn,"OK, so Elisangela is the BEST host I have ever worked with on Air BnB.  She responded almost immediately (within 5 minutes) of my initial Air BnB request, which was typical of all of our subsequent interactions.  She was present at the key exchange, which was a first for me.  She hung around and chatted for a while and showed me around, which was also really nice.  AND she bought groceries--(milk, yogurt, juice, coffee cake, and every toiletry I could possibly imagine).  This is a 3rd story walk-up apartment, so maybe not for those who can't take stairs, but it was clean and had an airy feel, and I felt absolutely comfortable there.  The photos are a very good representation of the apartment.  And, what a treat, it has HD cable TV!  Bed was comfortable, and the host really put a lot of thought into ensuring the guest had everything possibly imaginable--honestly I felt like we were long-time friends by the time she left; that's how much care she took in ensuring my comfort.  There is an outdoor space as well, which had a nice breeze on warm nights.  The East Boston neighborhood was safe and friendly, with an excellent restaurant (Angela's Cafe) just across the street.  This restaurant has been featured on the Food Network and did not disappoint.  While the apartment does not have parking, there was plenty of parking to be found on the street (within 1 block); one just needs to be mindful of street cleaning days (twice a month, I think).  I will definitely want to stay here again.   Perfect experience."
4614037,36886811,2015-07-02,34776024,Robert,"What an excellent experience. Elisangela is a very warm and welcoming host, and she even provided some food stables and bathroom supplies for our visit. My daughters (10 & 13) and mother (73) and my brother and I enjoyed the cosy apartment as well as the the location (short walk to the subway). Across the street is an excellent Mexican restaurant and grocery stores are close by for basic supplies.  It is a working class neighborhood, but very safe and a nice park/play-ground just down the street.  Also, short taxi rides to downtown Boston and North End, and even shorter trip to the airport."
"Elisangela was very helpful with all of our questions as it was our fist time to Boston. \"",,,,,
4614037,38022822,2015-07-12,21570634,Viba,"The host was very friendly and responsive to communication and responded quickly via email and text message.  She was flexible with us arriving earlier than expected.  The apartment was clean and good for a short stay. She also purchased some groceries (juice, cookies, bread) and had toiletries, clean linens and towels in the apartment. It was very close to the airport - good for early flights."
A few things to note:,,,,,
*Would only stay with a maximum of 3 adults.  The bed in the second bedroom can fit 2 children,but likely not spacious enough for 2 adults.,,,,
*The living area air conditioning did not work very well,making it too hot for anyone to sleep on the futon. You can only run the air conditioner either in the bedrooms or the living area,due to possible power shortage.,,,
*Very steep stairwell to climb to arrive at the apartment. We specifically chose to stay due to an early flight and had luggage that was difficult to carry up the stairs.,,,,,
*Toll to exit East Boston to downtown Boston via car/taxi/uber $5.25.,,,,,
*Neighborhood was residential with families - not many tourists.,,,,,

Her apartment was exactly as pictured, very clean and beautiful. She was a godsend as we booked last minute that day and she was still able to get everything ready very quickly. She bought extra toothbrushes and other toiletries in the bathroom which was a sweet and useful gesture. The air conditioning kept us cool even on the third floor on a very hot week in boston. Coffee and tea in her kitchen for us to use, extra pillows and blankets, really just anything we could have needed was there for us. Also Angela's cafe across the street really is just as good as she says so that was a nice treat! It was on food network and there are two other restaurants that were featured on food network within a mile of the apartment as well which was really cool. This apartment was definitely the highlight of our stay and I would recommend it to anyone!"

This is a good place for 5. Both bedrooms are sweetly decorated and hall is big enough as well. Elisangela is a charming host she left us lot of stuff in the refrigerator even new toiletries in the bathroom.,,,,,

4614037,48542137,2015-09-27,41415441,Laura,"I loved our stay in Boston and Elisangela was a big part of making that happen. She was extremely flexible when we got caught in traffic. We had different parties coming in at different times thanks to a wedding and she helped us get in and get out smoothly. The place is lovely, with hardwood floors, a spacious living room and the beds were very comfy. It was clean and neat, and the location is great for getting in and out of downtown. And the restaurant across the street was fantastic. I will definitely recommend this place to others heading up to Boston."
4614037,50207288,2015-10-10,32251430,Glenda,"We would definitely recommend Elisangelas home for other Boston travellers.  Good location, close to airport and comfortable accommodations.  Elisangela was quick to respond to us.  She had snacks, fruit and some juices for us."
4614037,50536478,2015-10-12,45206451,Gaby,"Wir hatten eine tolle Zeit in Boston. Das Viertel, East Boston, war von der Stadt leicht und schnell zu erreichen. Die Nachbarschaft war sehr städtisch, aber auch sehr sicher. Wir haben leicht nette Restaurants gefunden, so dass wir zu Fuss dorthin gegangen sind. Die Wohnung selbst war ebenfalls sehr nett und sauber. Sie ist super aufgeteilt, schön eingerichtet, so dass auch vier Leute bequem Platz darin fänden. Elisangela hatte uns einige Lebensmittel in den Kühlschrank gestellt, so dass wir nach einem Gang zum Bäcker gemütlich frühstücken konnten. Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen!"
4614037,51065650,2015-10-17,45735782,Laurent,"Elisangela was a perfect host. We arrived earlier than expected and she did all her best to arrive quickly. The apartment is well decorated and  well equipped. Nice small terrace. It is a second floor apartement with small stairs so it is not adapted for people who has physical difficulties, for us was fine !"
The location is fine to use the Train (subway) and visit Boston,only 5 min walking distance. Very quiet neighborhood. We tested as recommanded by Elisangela Angela's cafe just across the street which was a perfect place to eat very good mexican food.,,,,
Very easy to park in front of the apartment for free.,,,,,
"I totally recommand this place !\"",,,,,
4614037,51593594,2015-10-21,9035762,Laura,Elisangela was great! She was flexible with our arrival time which was such a help. The place was very comfortable and clean! I would highly recommend it.
4614037,54631001,2015-11-22,7441071,Jessica,"Elisangela was a wonderful host.  She was in constant communication with me on our arrival day and accomodated our last minute request for an early arrival.  When we arrived, we were pleased to find a clean and well-stocked apartment that comfortably fit four people and our two dogs.  The building was secure and located close to Angela's Cafe, Santarpios and provided easy access to downtown Boston.  Elisangela was friendly in all communications and quick to respond.  Our family could not have asked for a nicer place to spend a weekend."
4614037,68544805,2016-04-05,14701236,Chris,"Elisangela was a gracious hostess who bent over backwards to make us feel at home. The apartment was a perfect and affordable option close to Logan Airport and just minutes from the airport T stop. The restaurant across the street, Angela's Café, was an unexpected treat every morning for breakfast as well as for late night margaritas. I'll stay here again the next time I'm in Boston!"
4614037,71239182,2016-04-24,5330734,Fabian,everything great!

4614037,78908306,2016-06-10,4225963,Bill,"Elisangela is a superb host -- welcoming and available as needed.  Easy access to Boston Logan was the initial impetus we chose her apartment, but other reasons will also bring us back:  super-clean lodgings, nicely stocked kitchen, a great cafe across the street with delicious food and excellent service, and a fun deck to enjoy a nice evening.  Besides all that, Elisangela was totally on top of getting back to us a piece of luggage accidentally left behind at the apartment.  Thanks!"
4614037,80407619,2016-06-18,26440566,Esther,"Elisangela was a wonderfully kind host! The apartment is welcoming and well-appointed. All of the beds, including the futon, were very, very comfortable. The rooftop patio area was charming and so fun to enjoy on a summer evening. The apartment is conveniently located near Airport Station (MTBA) and we were able to sightsee downtown Boston with ease from here. We would definitely stay here again!"
4614037,80950290,2016-06-20,71133954,Jen,"An absolutely wonderful experience! Elisangela was a terrific host - friendly, super easy to work with and prompt on logistics. The apartment is beautiful, with a terrific roof deck. Don't miss the neighborhood favorites, Rino's and Angela's Cafe. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
4614037,81654840,2016-06-24,12273099,Whitney,"Elisangela was a wonderful host. The apartment was in a great location, only a short walk to the T, and a couple stops away from downtown. She was very quick to respond to any questions we had, and was very forgiving when we were having trouble getting our rental car on time and needed a little bit longer. We can't wait to visit Boston and stay here again!"
4614037,82474984,2016-06-27,23136748,Erin,"We had a lovely stay at Elisangela's.  She was easy to communicate with and welcomed us on our arrival.  The apartment is very close to the airport (walking distance if you're not schlepping too much luggage), but you never hear the airplanes, so all of the convenience without any of the noise. It's a nice neighborhood with lots of families. Not many bars and restaurants, but it's easy to get into the city center. The apartment was very nice and comfortable.  There is a back terrace with a grill, which we used a lot since it was nice out.  We really enjoyed our two-night stay there and would certainly return if we are back in Boston."
4614037,84175087,2016-07-05,39068110,Anita,"We enjoyed staying at Elisangela's home in East Boston. Her home is very convenient to the T-line and to Boston Commons, Freedom Trail, and other attractions in Boston.  We did not need to rent a car since our primary mode of transportation was the T-line.   Elisangela's home is very clean, beautiful and quaint. She goes out of her way to make you feel very welcomed and at home."
The neighborhood is very safe and there are a lot of great eateries in the area eg.) Angela's and a Mexican bakery close by that sells fresh and warm mexican bread. We were able to go running during our stay and ran from her home to the nearby parks. It was nice to be able to see the skyline of Boston.,,,,,
In all,we would definitely recommend Elisangela's home to anyone who is looking at staying at a home verses a hotel. Every night it felt like we were at home. (The only advice we would give to visitors is that you must be comfortable climbing stairs because our rental was on the 3rd floor) The pictures posted on Airbnd were an accurate representation.,,,,
"Thank you Elisangela for letting us stay at your beautiful and lovely home. We hope our paths will cross again someday.\"",,,,,

12264207,77600309,2016-06-02,68119840,Brendan,We had a great experience staying here. Lisa was very accomadating and made sure we had fresh linens and towels.
"I would stay at this location again. \"",,,,,
12264207,78638316,2016-06-08,9616584,Henna,I made a last minute reservation and Lisa was very responsive to any questions I had regarding the apartment. The apartment comes with 4 twin beds in a two bedroom apartment. It is located close to public transportation and a grocery store. The apartment comes stocked with basic kitchen essentials (minus a microwave).
12264207,80456361,2016-06-18,7819714,Tom,"Lisa was very friendly, great to deal with and responsive to any messages/calls. Off-street parking can be arranged via the building management who have an office in the building (they open at 9am). The building manager/maintenance man is a really nice guy and always wishes you a great day. The apartment was spacious and clean. No sofa or TV (if that is important to you - I didn't need that). Big kitchen that looked like it had everything you need to cook (I didn't). There are a few steps into the building and then an elevator takes you to Lisa's apartments (she operates two) on the 4th floor. As the apartment sits on top of a hill, you have a nice panoramic view of the city and opening the windows can provide a welcome breeze. There is also a small balcony if you wanted to sun yourself. I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend Lisa's apartment, especially to those on a business trip (the reason for my stay)."
12264207,83048792,2016-07-01,75607333,Alejandra,"El apartamento es agradable con excelente vista de la ciudad, espacioso y muy Bueno para estar con los Niños es seguro y la comunidad es tranquila. Con un parque al pasar la calle que reune distintas actividades al aire libre."
12264207,84265677,2016-07-06,75453811,Nicolas,"The host was great, the place is clean, there are laundry machines on the first floor, and the apartment is walking distance from a Walgreens where you can buy groceries. By Uber the place is like $8-10 away from downtown. All in all its a pretty good value and I would probably stay here again next time I'm in Boston."
12264207,92954991,2016-08-10,24299270,Andrej,"Lisa is was helpful when I called her, but I never met her in person. The apartment only has the most basic furniture (beds and a table) and it needs a proper cleaning. The internet was slow or not working. The neighbourhood is nice and the green and orange lines are 10 mins walking distance away."
12264207,94883991,2016-08-17,26263968,Teresa,"Lisa's place was a good value.  It had everything we needed, with no frills.  It is on top of a hill, so be conscious of that if you're with anyone who is mobility impaired.  The 1/2 mile walk from the T is all uphill on the way home.  There was no futon/couch in the livingroom, like in the pictures.  But we made it work.  If you're on a budget, this is a good choice."
4350995,21567517,2014-10-19,22586633,Leigh,"This was a wonderful place to stay for the weekend - roomy, clean loft with a GREAT comfy bed - my friend and I slept really well. The North End was a great neighborhood to stay in with lots of awesome restaurants and hang outs, but also easy T access to other popular boston spots. Overall, a win!"
4350995,21934290,2014-10-26,20337106,Roman,Great location.  Very friendly hosts.  Also appartment has great view and gets good sun. Bed super comfy.  The only issue is that the walls are fairly thin.  Overall we very much enjoyed our stay.
4350995,22667107,2014-11-11,22630469,Rawahuddin,Daniel was an excellent host! He was out of town and his friend brought us the keys to the house. The space was immaculate and comfortable. The location in north end was so awesome. They left a map for us that we used a lot. Thanks Daniel!

"Merci !\"",,,,,
4350995,33206269,2015-05-25,6440866,Kim,"The apartment is in a perfect location.  Access to everything in the area is all close by.  The apartment itself is very quiet, we hardly ever saw or heard anyone in the building and its a pretty big building.  It has 5 floors and the apt is on the 4th floor but there is an elevator.  No problem getting the keys from him.  I would highly recommend staying here and I will hopefully stay here again."

4350995,36479597,2015-06-28,27664633,Carina,"Daniel and his wife were so friendly and welcoming and they were so flexible with our late arrival time- showing us the place and getting us settled before leaving on their own trip. The place was perfect- so simple and tastefully decorated, it was lovely to come back to after a day of walking around the city. And that bed! The memory foam mattress/pillows made for a super comfortable sleep. All around a great experience, would love to stay here again!"

They left us everything we may need for our stay with a small kid and my son thought this was the coolest place we had ever been. The apartment is in a perfect spot, tucked away in a quiet street next to the green corridor between Back Bay and the South End right behind the Prudential Center. I strongly recommend it to anyone!"
48612,232633,2011-04-20,265732,Michael,I can't imagine a better location to stay at in Boston!  The accommodations were better than expected and close proximity to everything.  Cecile was easy to reach via email and text messaging.  I would absolutely recommend Cecile to anyone!

The apartment was exactly what we needed - a quiet bedroom for my son's grandparents,a comfortable fold-out couch for me,and an air mattress for my son in the kid's room.,,,
The apartment is very clean,warm and comfortable - it had everything we needed.  It is conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood in the Back Bay,very close to the Prudential T-stop.  The Prudential Center also has several Zipcars,within a very short walk.  We walked most places in the city that we visited.,,

The apartment is clean and well set up to accommodate 4 people.  It does get warm in any area that does not have a fan directly blowing on the person except for the AC window unit in the back bedroom.  Explanations about the apartment were well laid out and maps and books were there to use which was quite thoughtful.We enjoyed our stay there."

48612,1451817,2012-06-10,572079,Laura,"We spent a great couple days at Cecile's apartment. Everything was true to form -- it was comfy, light and spacious and in a great location a stone's throw from Back Bay and Copley etc. I was really attracted to this listing because we were traveling with our own children (2 and 5), and as a parent herself, the apartment had all the necessary amenities for kids including great toys, books, guides books highlighting places of interest for children/families, a nearby playground -- she even recommended a babysitter (who was amazing) one night for us. Cecile was prompt in responding to all our questions and very thorough with the details regarding the use of her home. I would gladly recommend Cecile's apartment - especially to families with young kids. This was a first time use of Airbnb for us and I am happy to say you've made us fans. Thanks again Cecile!"
48612,1668516,2012-07-09,418394,Karl,Cecile's place was beautiful and she was a great host for my wife and I.  The roofdeck view on a sunny day was one of the best places to sit out and relax!  I highly suggest this place to anyone looking for a relaxing stay in the city.

My husband, mom, sister, and I stayed at her apartment during my 1st trip to Boston and 1st Boston Marathon.  Coordination and communication for arrival, departure, and everything in-between was done with ease.  The location was perfect for the event.  It was conveniently located in the Back Bay area with easy access to the T line and taxis.  Shaws, a local grocery store, was right around the corner as was easy access to shopping and trolley/duck tours.  The apartment was spacious, clean, and my family absolutely loved the interior décor.  There were great instructions that detailed where we would find necessities in the apartment and also guidebooks for our trip.  Cecile and her family made us feel so welcome with homemade granola, bath oil, and body butter upon our arrival.  There were also signs and paintings in the apartment full of well wishes and support for the Boston marathon, which helped make an amazing weekend and experience one I will never forget!  This was my first Air BnB experience.  Because it was so positive and better than expected, I am definitely open to doing it again and HIGHLY recommend Cecile’s apartment!  Many thanks to Cecile, Taylor, and Elana!"

They were also great at giving us helpful advice for exploring."
The apartment comfortably catered for four people and was left in very tidy condition for us.

We were extremely fortunate that Cecile and her family listed their beautiful space.  Cecile was a fantastic host; providing tips on how to operate things in their home, information about the surrounding areas, and following up with us to make sure we found everything we needed during our stay.  She provided quick responses whenever I needed to reach her.  The apartment fits 4 people very comfortably and is kept super clean.

The location was amazingly close to all of the activity but nicely tucked away out of the hubbub in a quiet neighborhood with nice parks and walkways.  The space was clean, pleasant and allowed the 4 of us to all have our own space.  We thought we'd be riding the T to get around but found we could walk to  pretty much everything we wanted to do for our weekend stay.   The book collection, including Boston guide books, was appreciated. We loved the view of the Prudential building at night."
48612,50407066,2015-10-11,7466625,Vivian,"Cecile was great in getting back to us with any question, 12 pages of instructions were available to us about how her place operates in that regard communication was efficient."
Her place is a fourth floor walk up in a quiet neighbourhood and it is close to the heart of Boston.,,,,,
What was disapointing to us was the readiness of the place up on our arrival,the place was lived in,the linen was not done and the towels were not in the best of shape,the shower could of use a good cleaning as well.  little details that make a difference. It was an expensive $400.00 night and we were not happy all the way!,,
All those things can be taking care of and the place improved to make it worth of $400.00 a night!,,,,,

48612,70666748,2016-04-19,2618236,Peter,The house:
The location is great!  It is a classic brownstone in a side street close to Copley square.  The unit is on the top floor of a 4 floor walk up.  The unit is a good size,both bedrooms have a queen sized bed.  The unit has lots of Windows and can be opened for a nice cross breeze.  Kitchen is a bit small and can only accommodate 1 person,but that's normal for this type of unit.  There is a roof top patio but it was under renovation while I was there.  Very secure area and the building has a locked front door.,,,
The host:,,,,,
Cecile is great! She welcomed us when we got there and gave us a walk through of the unit.  She had snacks,yogurt and other foods ready for us in the fridge.  She has a house document that details the rules and operations of the house,very useful.  Cecile was very accommodating with our travel schedule as well,,,
Thank you Cecile and your family!!!,,,,,

5455004,31955290,2015-05-12,4633847,Heidi,"Our host, Jordan was great to work with.  He was quick to respond to emails and text messages.  The apartment was very well-located, close to everything, and very comfortable.  It was great to have the parking space in the garage as a part of the deal.  The rooftop deck is a tremendous amenity and we took advantage of it almost every evening.  I wouldn't hesitate to rent from Jordan again!"
5455004,32786682,2015-05-21,10225677,Clinton,Jordan was a great communicator when I was attempting to book and he really helped a lot in helping us secure his spot.
The neighborhood is fantastic - walkable to great restaurants and bars in Boston and the complex is quiet,easy to access.,,,,
Interior is very well maintained and very spacious. 2 large bedrooms,both with Queens,one a master,so 2 full bathrooms + a large living room that bleeds into the dining area. Good size galley kitchen,plenty big. Washer/Dryer in unit and a parking space in the garage below the building. All in all this is as easy,comfortable
Last point,had 2 other colleagues with me so one got the pull out sofa in the living room,"they said it was comfy and they slept well both nights on it. Great value and really solid spot - nice stay!\"",,,

1. The Internet connection is reliable,but rather slow.,,,,
If you are on business trip and dependent on video conferencing / data synchronization,you may have occasional problems.,,,,
2. There is second contract to sign,which according to AirBnB rules is OK,"but has to be mentioned (and detailed) in the listing's description. This was not the case.\"",,,

5455004,49775742,2015-10-06,956823,Glenn,"The pros: great location... quiet, but close to everything.  The unit was clean and new.  The cons: bad communication.  My family and I stood outside the building for a full hour in the cold because keys to the unit were not in the lockbox as they were supposed to be.  And, since the owner lives 3,000 miles away, it was quite a hassle trying to find somebody to come let us in.  Not a great beginning to our trip.  Other than that, the unit was as advertised."

The apartment was very clean.  Recommend gourmet Star Market grocery store across the street if groceries needed.  If you want a classy seafood meal...highly recommend Atlantic Fish Company (very reasonable for lunch) and a great steak...Abe & Louie's...both within walking distance on Boylston Street.\""
5455004,54120874,2015-11-16,30489341,William,"This apartment is magnificent. The apartment itself is located in such an amazing area, I encourage you to really venture out and walk around Back Bay. It's right by a 24 hour supermarket, a block away from 7-Eleven, a 5 minute walk away from Boylston Street (great food and bars) and down the street from the Prudential Tower (Boston's tallest building). There is a lovely rooftop patio in the apartment where my friends and I shared some drinks while taking in the sunset in Boston which was magnificent. I can not rave enough about Sarah, who works in the offices of the apartment building -- I spoke to Jordan Allen about an early check-in to no avail (we couldn't check in early and had nowhere to leave our bags) but Sarah let us leave them in the office where she works while we explored the town until we could check in. The apartment itself is spacious and comfortable, providing a feel as soon as you walk in that it is an extension of your home. I would absolutely stay in this apartment on every subsequent visit to the beautiful city of Boston!"

5455004,66893688,2016-03-25,57579471,Richard,"We enjoyed our stay in the Garrison Square apartment.  It suited our needs well and overall, met our expectations.  In particular, the location was very good, near dining, shops, the Copley T stop was 3-4 blocks walk, the supermarket was 1-2 blocks away.  An added feature which we appreciated was the availability of a parking garage, though I would note the particular space could be tight to get into, if surrounding cars were also parked.  Also, the apartment is noted to be quiet, and it was, with the exception of trash pickup about 7:30 AM on Monday and Thursday, when we were still sleeping.  Finally, the directions to get there and the instructions for entry worked just fine.  The host was completely business-like in his dealings with us, as well."
5455004,67558912,2016-03-30,5054920,Lorena,"The apartment was incredible, well situated and very very clean.  We really enjoyed our stay at this location. We fully recommend this apartment and can see the difference between an apartment that's maintained by a professional company. Thanks."
5455004,69298389,2016-04-10,60807082,Karen,"Fantastic location and great layout for 2 bedroom, 2 bath - very comfortable for 2 couples.  Having underground parking for 1 car is key - and while the space that's assigned to the unit (well, all spaces in this garage) are TIGHT it was safe and great to leave the car for the weekend w/out worrying.  If you are sensitive to light, bring eye shades (apt has morning sun!)"

Jordan was very fast at responding to messages on the website and we were able to easily access the keys in the lock box. The apartment was in a great location, close to Copley/Prudential and very convenient from the Back Bay T stop. There was also a nearby grocery store (Star Market) where we were able to get some food to keep in the house. We were in a similar apartment to the one in the images, that had a slightly different layout but the same look/furniture. The apartment was very new and clean."
5455004,89030342,2016-07-26,19436326,Chris,"The place is beautiful, clean and in a perfect location in downtown Boston. The only downside was that the air conditioning didn't seem to be working and the house never got to a comfortable temperature in the middle of a heat wave that hit Boston. If the AC works I would stay again because everything else was perfect."

It was a five minute walk, very close to everything...right in the heart of Little Italy!!!  The apt. was clean and comfortable.

Ci è venuto a prendere alla South Station, ed è sempre disponibile per consigli di qualsiasi tipo. Flessibile con gli orari di arrivo e partenza, ci ha dato fantastici consigli sui posti vicino la casa. La casa è accogliente e pulita, con a disposizione molto più di ciò che serve realmente in una vacanza. Ci sono anche stati offerti dei buonissimi arancini di benvenuto. La posizione è ottima, dentro Little Italy, con 2 metro e la stazione nord raggiungibili a piedi ed il freedom trail ad 1 minuto di distanza. Ottimi bar, pasticcerie e ristoranti a due passi, il quartiere offre cibo italiano di ottima qualità. Consiglierò sicuramente Anthony ed il suo alloggio a chiunque andrà a Boston.

Anthony also provided great insight into good places to eat in the North End.  Coffee,pot,and cream/sugar provided; Bathroom was clean,however you may want to bring your own shampoo/soap.  The TP was very soft and nice.  Clean bath towels/washcloths provided.,,
We did cook a little and did not find a lack of utensils in the kitchen.,,,,,
The ceiling is low.  I am 6'2'' and was not too uncomfortable,however had to duck to move in and out of rooms.,,,,
We arrived at the airport fairly early (9 am) and it's a $20 taxi or uber to the apartment.  Anthony was flexible and met us early and provided 2 sets of keys.,,,,,
Although the TV is old,it does have cable and WiFi.  It looked like a printer was available for use,but we did not use it.,,,

He was always very friendly when we saw him, and always seemed willing to go the extra mile for us if requested, but was more than happy to let us do our own thing as well."
The place itself was as described,and looked exactly as it appears in the pictures. It really is very handy to everything,and there are numerous restaurants and eateries in the area. He certainly isn't wrong about the low ceilings at the entrance,"but I am 6\"\"2'",and I found it manageable.,

You are free to come and go as needed since you have your own entrance. Anthony was available when we needed him and even came over around 10:30 pm to show us how to use the laundry. Anthony offered to give us a tour of the neighborhood for free (he runs a tour business) & we would have loved to take him up on it but we'd planned our itinerary in advance and it was crammed full of things to do.

He offered us everything in the kitchen in case we wanted to make our own food (but with all of the awesome restaurants nearby, why would we do that!). The apartment is within a few blocks of a T station, which is the best way to get to any part of the city, and it's also within blocks of a number of historic sites in the North End. We had a great time on our trip, and a lot of it was due to the convenience of staying at a place so centrally located."
The only bad part about the apartment is the low ceiling at the entryway,"which is also next to the bathroom. I forgot about it once. I didn't forget again. Ouch! I'm 5'10\"\"","so the ceiling is probably right around 5'9\"\" at that point. Everywhere else in the apartment","the ceilings are high enough to get around easily.\"",,

Perfect spot to be in for excellent restaurants, public transport, and all the downtown attractions. Anthony himself was friendly, helpful and accommodating, giving great recommendations for the best Italian food around. The place is as advertised-for the most part. The bed was small and not very comfortable, and with the apartment being in the basement it was slightly dark, and stuffy on a warm day(however he said he would soon be installing an air conditioning unit). Overall we loved our visit to Boston and this place suited our basic needs well."

There is no daylight inside the apartment as it is in the basement with very tiny windows, but in the end you will only sleep there. Ventilation could be a bit better."

We didn't have many interactions with him. Place is like pictured, on a small building basement. Some maintenance might make it a little better, there's no air conditioning but it was not hot down there. The street is very quiet.

We messaged Anthony twice through the Airbnb website, texted him, and called him inquiring about check in time and procedure from May 5 to June 28, and had to call Airbnb with concern that we would not have a place to stay due to lack of communication. The Airbnb representative confirmed that Anthony had received and not responded to our messages, and called him to inquire. We did not hear from Anthony until 8:30am on the day of check in, and he claimed that he did not receive any messages."

4924910,43213725,2015-08-18,29037612,Peter,"\"Anthony was very welcoming, helped with our bags and ran through some of his local knowledge. The apartment is well located for \"\"little Italy\"\" and all of the restaraunts"
4924910,43390556,2015-08-19,34396312,Kaitlin,"Anthony was a great host! We had a great time during our stay in Boston. He was very accommodating about the check in time, showed us around, and offered to give us recommendations of places to eat. The apartment was clean, bed was comfy, and it was super nice having our own little unit to stay in! Would definitely stay here again. Also take him up on parking advice. Lots can be super expensive!"
4924910,43615708,2015-08-21,25871956,Joanne,Anthony was very welcoming and was kind enough to let us leave our bags there after our early flight arrival.
4924910,43880712,2015-08-22,10258283,Ivan,"I stayed here with a friend for a night out in Boston, and we had a wonderful time. The location couldn't be better - right in the middle of the North End, and Anthony is a great host - very attentive and helpful. Everything necessary was provided, and we had no issues."
4924910,44283240,2015-08-25,4886018,Catherina,Location is golden. We walked everywhere! Anthony was easy going and very nice. The place is as pictured. Seeing as it is a basement it can get quite damp but that did not bother us. It was a great place to rest in between all the wonderful things to see and do in Boston!
4924910,44480820,2015-08-26,19733203,Jose,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4924910,44524913,2015-08-27,2398644,Kara,The price and location can’t be beat. You’re in the heart of the North End and we walked every morning for a great cup of coffee and breakfast. Anthony was helpful and gave us good restaurant recommendations.
The apartment was stuffy and there was a smell of cigarette smoke from the tennants upstairs. It’s a basement so the ceilings are low and it’s dark. If you’re tall,you’ll be doing a lot of crouching. There’s no street parking so you’ll have to pay for parking. Anthony can tell you where to park and it’s a short walk to the apartment.,,,,
Overall,"it’s an amazing location at a bargain.\"",,,,
4924910,45770451,2015-09-06,11709713,Iouri,Anthony's place is excellent! Location is brilliant right in the North End and close to everything that is Boston.
Anthony is also a brilliant host. I arrived quite late and he waited around to explain everything and gave lots of excellent suggestions.,,,,,
"Would definitely  stay there again!!\"",,,,,
4924910,46374555,2015-09-10,7552599,Sergey,Very good location. We mostly were able to get everywhere by foot.
4924910,46577035,2015-09-12,7508996,Jim,I enjoyed my stay at Anthony's apt in the North End
"The location is great. Very reasonable rate for what you get.\"",,,,,
4924910,46809001,2015-09-13,10074888,Joe,"Excellent host, friendly, didn't make a big deal out of us being late, and the apartment was exactly as promised"
4924910,47499383,2015-09-19,41856219,Dorothy Ann,"\"If you want to visit Boston and need a place to hang your hat and get a night's sleep without paying a small fortune, I recommend this place.  The bed would be too small for two people who are above average size, but I traveled alone (I am a middle aged female) and it suited my needs perfectly.  I took the Downeaster train from Portland, Maine, a lovely experience in itself, and with a small overnight bag on wheels, I was able to walk to the little basement apartment in just a few minutes from the North End train station.  I then called Anthony on my cell phone and he met me at the door.  The unit has a small kitchen, but why would you want to cook at all when you are surrounded by all those lovely, amazing Italian restaurants, bakeries and cafes.  Other than sleeping, I was out and about Boston during my entire 2-night, 3-day stay and therefore had no need for the luxuries of a $300-$500+ per night hotel, and I had an amazing time, especially in the North End.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe and just blocks from all the North End has to offer, which is a lot!  Anthony told me about his Politically Incorrect Little Italy \"\"no BS\"\" tour that he offers"
4924910,47696636,2015-09-21,5916834,Christine,"Place was a little funky but had everything we needed (good shower, clean place, nice sheets, EXCELLENT location )."
4924910,48002568,2015-09-22,30468646,Richard,"Anthony was very helpful and accommodating to our changing travel schedule.  The apt was very clean and comfortable, though we did not want to spend much time there - with so much to do and see at this great location."
4924910,48303387,2015-09-25,21997867,Renee,"Anthony met us at the door when we got to the apartment. He gave us a detailed orientation about the place and even gave us tip on where it's cheaper and safer to park close by. His place was clean and cozy, perfect for an overnight at the city, especially if you needed a place to stay before you fly out of BOS. Nice Italian restos close by. Would recommend this place!"
4924910,49231280,2015-10-02,38165944,Carlos Enrique,"The apartment is in an excellent location and Anthony proved to be a very helpful host, always ready to give us a hand when required."
4924910,50425718,2015-10-12,26835139,Andy,The location of this apartment was fabulous as it was in the heart of the North End/Little Italy and in close walking distance to the waterfront. It was also only about 10 minutes to walk to a subway station.
Unfortunately it was obvious as soon as we descended into the apartment that a lot of smokers had either lived in the apartment or smoke drifted down to it...even the bed smelt of smoke! And of course,because it's a basement apartment,the tiny windows don't help.,,,
We expected,from the the description,that the apartment also appeared to act as storage for Anthony and his family. What surprised us a bit was that the kitchen/fridge also had loads of stuff stored in it (including when we arrived,a couple of mouldy cabbages) and the freezer was full. We noticed over the five nights we were there that people had been into the apartment a few times to either place or remove things from the fridge,which felt intrusive.,
Soon after we got into the apartment we realised there was only a tiny bit of toilet paper and no soap. We messaged Anthony but didn't hear back from him until the next day.,,,,,
Unfortunately the apartment really didn't appear to have been cleaned properly before we arrived and was more cluttered than appeared in the photos.,,,,,
The TV is also ancient and a bit flaky.,,,,,
If you do decide to stay in Anthony's apartment,we would strongly recommend doing his tour of Little Italy to understand the neighbourhood. It's great fun and you taste some great food,culminating in lunch at the apartment above this one (i.e. his parents' place).  We ended up going back to get subs from Monica's deli,pastries from the shop where he bought the pastries on the tour,had a great meal at Trattoria Il Panino,"and even bought a freshly baked loaf of bread from the bakery in Hanover St after getting up early one morning to watch the sunrise.  We didn't get the home cooked meal though.\""
4924910,51126843,2015-10-18,4243378,Chelsea,Anthony was very thorough with his property and made sure we were comfortable and knew where everything was. This was a great place to rest our head for the night. It's a great location in the north end!
4924910,51526307,2015-10-21,26490802,Joan,"\"We arrived @Anthony's place \"\"Cozy Spot\"\" before the previous renters had left. As we did not have a car"
4924910,51621493,2015-10-22,41519934,David,"Great location for the busy night life and restaurants in the North End. Anthony was very helpful, met us promptly, and helped us get a taxi on departure. The basement apartment suited us fine and we enjoyed our stay."
4924910,51897353,2015-10-25,41187802,Petar,Anthony was incredibly helpful and kind. For tall European ceiling is quite low but it's mentioned in the description so one should take notice. neighborhood is perfect for exploring Boston and really safe.
4924910,52204537,2015-10-27,10843424,Derek & Fiona,"\"Anthony's apartment is in a great location, both for exploring Boston & the Freedom Trail and for restaurants - there must be 100 restaurants within a 5 minute walk. Anthony gave us a great recommendation for a fish restaurant: Mare, which we thoroughly enjoyed. The low ceiling was ok. I'm 5'10\"\" and didn't once hit the lowest part between the lounge and bathroom."
Note: Haymarket,"the nearest subway station is closed until 2016. This didn't matter as we walked everywhere.\"",,,,
4924910,52567097,2015-10-31,26392017,Karen,"Anthony met us at his apartment and after showing us around gave us several recommendations for places to eat in the neighbourhood. We tried one of these on our first night and had a fabulous dinner.  The apartment was exactly as pictured and described.  We loved its quirkiness and closeness to the Boston's Italian North End area.  We literally walked out the front door, turned left and one block up were in 'Little Italy'. If you are into history, you are right on the doorstep of the Freedom Trail - turn any corner and you are on the doorstep of an historic building or site (think Paul Revere). The apartment is close to a metro stop but it is also really easy to walk to many attractions.  The apartment is comfortable and, as a basement, cosy.  It is lived in on occasion, so don't expect a sterile environment - you are likely to find things stored in the fridge and to feel like the owner is due to arrive home any moment. We rather enjoyed this - it felt like a real home, rather than an anonymous hotel. Anthony is a genuine Northender, with lots of stories and we really appreciated his inside knowledge.  If you have time, check out his politically incorrect tours of the area.  We wish we had the time to do one.  All in all - a great location and choice for a stay in Boston's historically important Northend. A warning however - be prepared for a calorie heavy stay - the Northend is known for it's fabulous choice of Italian cafes, pizzerias and restaurants but you'll need to do a lot of walking to work them off!  If you need to go out for breakfast - try the Boston Public Market - about a 5 minute walk from the apartment and with a great array of fresh produce and meals, including granolas with yoghurt and fruit, pastries, breakfast wraps and coffee etc."
4924910,52846598,2015-11-02,43136085,Frances,"Very accommodating host, and very helpful when asking about what to do in Boston. Can't beat the price for the location. There are many great restaurants and shops near by."
4924910,53044525,2015-11-04,3678915,Angela,"The apartment is in a terrific location, right next to the Freedom Trail, the Quincy markets. A perfect base to go wandering from with lots of great places to eat and drink near by."
The apartment was clean and tidy and fairly spacious for a basement apartment. Anthony was helpful and very nice. The shower was good and hot. The bed was ok,but a wee bit old and 'springy'.,,,,
If you are a non-smoker,I don't think I would recommend this place as there is a very strong smell of cigarette smoke. It's mainly in the entrance,not so bad in the apartment itself,"but still definitely noticeable if you are sensitive to smoke. \"",,
4924910,60095058,2016-01-18,19331529,Ethan,Anthony did a great job of communicating with us and his place was very cozy.  Conveniently located in Little Italy and just blocks away from part of the Freedom Trail.  Made our Boston experience very enjoyable.
4924910,60563377,2016-01-25,28592456,Slava,Anthony is a great host.
He had no issue with our indecisiveness on our arrival time and was not upset with our delay due to snow.,,,,,
The place was very nice and cozy and just as it appears in the photos - we could not have wished for a better stay in one of the best locations in Boston - close to all the hot spots and the airport.,,,,,
Anthony told us about the house in detail,where everything was and how to use the sink (it has an anti-burn child lock for hot water- smart!) as well as gave us recommendations for dinner when we asked. The place he sent us to was the most delicious Italian food I have ever had,and I've been to a few places in NY.,,,
He offered us to leave whenever the next day since no other guest was arriving which was very nice of him.,,,,,
"I wholeheartedly recommend Anthony's place and I would most definitely stay there again upon my future visits to Boston.\"",,,,,

4924910,64977861,2016-03-09,46857314,Craig,"Great authentic North End location. Close to the Garden, Gov  Center Parking, Boston Market, and the T. Try Bovas just down the street, for a slice of pie or a canola it's open 24 hrs. Apartment is cute and clean be it a bit dated..i was intown for a Who concert and All in all its exactly as it presents on the website. I will Def keep this in mind for future trips. Thanks Anthony and family!"
4924910,65171169,2016-03-11,59488308,John,"Anthony was very welcoming. He helped us find parking. (This was a little complicated to find initially) The room was clean, and met the purpose we needed for meetings in the downtown core the next morning. Anthony went above and beyond by having eggs available for us the next morning."
4924910,68669614,2016-04-06,41556216,Lynne,"Anthony was very welcoming - gave us lots of information about the neighbourhood and was available if we had any questions or needed anything. The location was perfect as we attended events at TD Garden, and it was also close to the T station. The apartment was clean, comfortable, had everything we needed and a homey feel to it. Would definitely stay here again."

The location of apartment was ideal and close to common tourist destinations. Area is safe and walkable at night.,,,,,
North End is a historic district,great starting point for Freedom Trail to Boston historic sites.,,,,
For those wanting an authentic Boston local experience Anthony offers ideal option. Apartment is furnished with quality vintage furniture similar to a residential dwelling which is a welcomed change.,,,,,
After a long day spent sight seeing,it was great to come back to a quiet,relaxing and well kept home.,,,
Anthony is a Boston native and provides insight transplants couldn't provide. He offers excellent advice for tourists.,,,,,
If you are in the area,I would highly recommend staying at Anthony's spot,"as he was a model Airbnb host.\"",,,

He went over everything we would need to know when checking in and gave us recommendations on where to eat. The location was great for visiting all the freedom trail sites. The apartment was clean and what was expected from the description.  The only drawbacks were, there was a smoke smell at the entrance and the bed wasn't super comfortable but definitely worth it for the great location and price. I would definitely recommend Anthony's cozy corner for a weekend getaway to Boston!"
4924910,69804763,2016-04-13,4751815,Fabio,"A localização do imóvel é perfeita, North End é o melhor bairro para explorar Boston. Perto do metrô e do lado de excelentes atrações. Anthony dá boas dicas e é muito amigável, me recebeu logo cedo e guardou minhas malas, pois o outro hóspede ainda não havia partido. O apartamento tem um preço acessível, por isso não espere por luxo ou mimos. O local é simples, antiquado, a cama é um pouco barulhenta e se você é um não-fumante e não gosta de cheiro de cigarro, este não é o apartamento pra você."

Anthony was very welcoming and kindly offered to give us additional advice on the area on request. The location is excellent and the space was as described. The sheets for the foldout were a little old but apart from that everything was in order. Highly recommended.

The apartment is quite dark and does have low ceilings but neither of us were particularly tall,  so it didn't matter.  I didn't actually get a chance to meet Anthony but he made sure we had all the info we needed and someone was available to let us in and explain things."
4924910,79402208,2016-06-12,53883079,Kim,"Anthony was like a family friend. The space was just as listed. No surprises here. It was safe and clean for my 16 year old daughter and I. It reminded me of my grandmas house growing up; cozy and warm.. Anthony gave us a solid tour upon arrival. He gave us great tips for food and general info about the neighborhood. The bed was a little stiff for us, but the place was great!! The best location in the North End! We would have loved take Anthony's tour but my daughter and I were only in town for a couple days. You want to know the facts-He's your guy!"

Walking the streets in the morning and getting a cup of coffee from the local cafe is recommended. The neighborhood has a great feel. The only negative was the parking availability. Very tight....if any available."
4924910,81364682,2016-06-22,28695990,Courtney,"While I was not expecting to stay at a 4 star resort at this location, it still was very disappointing. If you are over 6 foot, don't stay here, the ceiling is too short and the door frames will cause you to hit your head. There is not air conditioning as advertised, it was unbearably hot in the apartment. Also while it appears to be mostly clean, if you actually inspect the place, it really isn't. There were hairballs and dust balls in the corners and the bathroom was really not clean enough to have guests stay. The location is great and we only stayed for 24 hours, thank goodness. Had we been planning to stay longer I probably would have made other arrangements. Being in the north end is the only positive of this place. If you are planning a very short stay in Boston, this place will suffice, however I would recommend finding another location."

Me and my 17 year old daughter felt very safe staying in this neighborhood.  The apartment is right in the middle of the North End is just blocks away from 100s of restaurants, downtown and the subway. Anthony met us there when we arrived in Boston to give us the key and even made a suggestion on where to eat dinner. We took his food tour of little Italy and learned so much about the neighborhood. I highly recommend the tour, Learning about the neighborhood and the stories we heard really gave us a perspective we wouldn't have had otherwise. If we ever come back we would be more than happy to stay there again."

Anthony was very accommodating with the fact that I was on a busy schedule and could not get to the apartment until late. Would definitely recommend.
4924910,92112412,2016-08-07,63524892,Tracy,"The apartment was great and Anthony was very helpful. He left many brochures for attractions and offered his suggestions for local restaurants. The neighbourhood is great, overall a very good experience."
4924910,92399012,2016-08-08,13268075,Susan,"Comfortable, homey, basic, but everything I needed for a convenient one night stay.  Incredible location."
4924910,92910544,2016-08-10,11210702,Karin,"\"die lage der wohnung ist toll und Antony und seine eltern waren sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich! aber es war unsere bei weitem teuerste (wenngleich nicht gerade gemütlichste) AirBnB-unterkunft während einer 4 wöchigen reise durch den USA-osten. dass die räume sehr niedrig und im basement sind, wurde zwar angekündigt, aber da es keine fenster bzw. die möglichkeit zu tageslicht gibt, fühlt man sich leicht wie \"\"eingekellert\"\" ;(! entschädigt wird man wie gesagt durch die tolle lage mitten in Little Italy"
4924910,93113326,2016-08-11,63950722,Charles,"Excellent communication and responsiveness for the owner.  My only issues were that the building had a funny smell and the bed wasn't very comfortable.  If you're picky about those things, I'd avoid, but if not, the location is fantastic and its priced affordably."
4924910,94081830,2016-08-14,5346329,Bob,"\"Anthony's place was like a time-capsule in Little Italy. The neighborhood is wonderful and Anthony was a terrific host. The place is very convenient to buses and the subway at Haymarket - be sure to check out the street market on weekends. The basement apartment has low ceilings so if you are taller than 6'1\"\" it might be a little cramped. I'd stay here again.\""
4924910,95494973,2016-08-20,22130564,Sarah,"Anthony was an excellent host and the photos in the profile are accurate. This is an older style, basement apartment in a wonderful Boston neighborhood."
We requested an early check-in the day before and Anthony accommodated us without issue. During our stay the hair dryer blew a fuse and Anthony made sure it was fixed that day.,,,,,
My only criticisms are the cigarette smoke from the upstairs neighbors was frequently noticed within the apartment,"and the bedding seemed a bit old and worn out. Otherwise it was a good experience.\"",,,,
4924910,95988879,2016-08-21,46960005,Ran,"Pro: 1. Very good location, in Italian community and can almost walk to anywhere! 2. Spacious. 3 has a full kitchen 4 the apartment is nice and clean 5 Antony is quite friendly"
Cons: 1. In a basement & furniture are all very old,"esp. the sofa - the cover for the sofa really needs changing! \"",,,,

We could not be more delighted with Christina´s place. It is neat, very spacious, and to our surprise very well equipped. It has every you need plus information to move around Boston. It is very well located, walking distance from the main shopping centers and tour attractions. I would certainly recommend it very highly and for sure next time I go I will surely rent the same place."

It is very comfortable,spacious and clean with bed and toilet linen,brochure about Boston and all the possible  information you need inside the flat.,,,
The neighborhood is nice and not dangerous,the flat is near to Prudential centre and Back Bay. Boston is small and in few minutes you could reach every historical o commercial sites by subway or on walk. I'm happy about my choise!,,,,
"Thank Christina\"",,,,,
650956,8515993,2013-11-04,4580644,Hilary,"We loved this apartment in South End and are only sorry we didn't stay longer in Boston. It was spacious, clean and cosy for a family of five with three teenagers and in an excellent location. We walked everywhere around the city from here, using the fantastic information provided by Christina (including where to eat).  It had everything we needed and we'll certainly come back next time we're in Boston. Thank you."

We found it really convenient to travel to different parts of the city as the apartment was strategically located really close to the orange line. Everything worked well and our stay at her place was very comfortable and safe. I would definitely stay here again.

650956,16603918,2014-07-30,31299,DaVe,"Great location! This two bedroom was perfect for our family of four to spread out and relax after a day of sightseeing. Having a wide accessory of kids toys and supplies was a major plus for us! This is city living, so be prepared for some noise from neighbors."
650956,19257735,2014-09-09,6215777,Gemma,"Stayed at Christina's apartment in South End from the 4th to the 8th of Sept. There was a slight hiccup when we arrived but Christina was available at the end of the phone and got things sorted for us the following morning. She was very apologetic and generous to us. If you are looking for a good base in Boston, then I would recommend staying here. Good host and good location."

Lists of restaurants, sites, transportation tips are all available.  The unit has a washer/dryer which is great when you've been on the road for a while.  It is within easy walking distance to both the best restaurants and Back Bay train station.  Great!"
650956,21649970,2014-10-21,1784352,Pearlynn,We stayed at Christina's apartment for 3 nights. We travelled as 2 couples. Christina responded to emails and queries promptly and was always very helpful. We had an issue accessing the apartment building and had to call Christina and Josh. Both were really helpful. The apartment was clean and had enough  space for the four of us. We had a great stay. Thanks Christina :)

She had plenty of pillows and linens, and her kitchen was well-laid out for guests.  She provided a wealth of information about the area, and even left us cards for public transportation to help with navigating the T."
The area of the apartment was very nice,and we enjoyed walking to dinner at different locations nearby as well.  Really loved the donut shop around the corner- it had great coffee and delicious donuts.,,,,

650956,32100251,2015-05-14,23084448,Carole,The property was in an excellent location. It was an easy walk to attractions or to the subway.
650956,32323346,2015-05-17,28135161,Sharon  Weisenborn,"\"Overall,on a scale of one to ten,  this property would rate a 5.  Pictures  of apartment are much better than in person. Furniture was worn with paint splashes on dining chairs, couch faded and stained. Kitchen was definitely not as clean as should be. We , thankfully brought Clorox wipes with us to clean stove, dishwasher and toaster oven.  Half bath sink leaked, front doorknob fell off, patio and outside furniture was filthy. No way could we sit outdoors to enjoy that space.  One large window in living room was boarded up with plywood.  Landlord explained they had a bad winter and ice had damaged window....but this was middle of May!  This apartment has no central air.  Landlord stated when I called window units were not needed as yet.  Place was ,therefore very stuffy.  Doors to a utility closet fell off..nearly scared us to death.  When I complained to landlord unit was dirty, her response was , \"\"It is clean... but old.\"\"  Linens may have been clean but were very faded and should be replaced. Good things?  Have to say"
650956,34119836,2015-06-05,6681265,Pedro Nicolas,All great. Excellent apartment and location. Christina is super cool. We will came back.

650956,41213703,2015-08-05,1267261,John,"Great host, great property and great location. All as described and felt like home. Christina let us leave our cases in the property during the day as we had a red eye flight home and no one was checking in."
650956,41720676,2015-08-09,26592383,Damian,"We had a fantastic time in Boston. Christina was the perfect hostess. Communication brilliant before, during, and after our stay. The apartment is in a great location - five minutes walk to the tube, and a few minutes walk from loads of cafes and restaurants. It is an easy ten minute walk to boston common too. The accommodation is brilliant, very spacious and with all mod cons, and supplies. One review gave negative feedback about the outdoor space, but I disagree. We found everything clean and well maintained, and enjoyed sitting outside for a few sundowners. We left some items in property by accident, and Christina went out of her way to help us with this.  Thanks for a great time."

650956,61625150,2016-02-07,29763001,Emily,"We had a good stay at the property.  The pictures were accurate and there was plenty of space for us to spread out.  Even though we weren't traveling with children, this place would be perfect for that since Christina has all the supplies that you would need.  The only minor layout thing was that the full bath is accessed through one of the bedrooms, so if you aren't there with family that could get a little awkward.  We had one minor concern about the double airbed while we were there and Christina was very responsive."
650956,71051140,2016-04-23,60558719,Chauntelle,"My family of four just had a wonderful time in Boston at Christina's apartment. The location is amazing! We walked everywhere or took the T. There are loads of restaurants on the next block, and grocery stores within a 10-15 minute walk. We took the T to the aquarium and the science museum, and walked to Boston Commons, as well as an amazing playground right on Clarendon. The apartment was clean, cozy and had absolutely everything we could possibly need. It was so nice to return to after a long day of seeing the sights. We will stay here on our next trip to Boston!"
650956,80130819,2016-06-16,52100869,Chidera,"I stayed at Christina's place with a coworker on a 4 day, 3 night work trip. Her home is conveniently located in a lovely neighborhood, with all of the amenities you would need within 15-20 minutes walking distance or a 5 minute Uber ride."
Her instructions for getting into the home,and for caring for it were clear and detailed,and we were able to enter and leave the rental without issue.,,,
The top floor of Christina's home is lovely,with a large kitchen,and a half-bath. The bedrooms are located down a set of stairs,with the master bedroom facing onto a fenced in deck area,while the second bedroom is facing the street,and as such
We had two issues during our trip. There was no A/C installed at the time of my trip. I called Christina once we realized that and she informed us that the bedrooms cool off significantly at night,and that there were fans to use as well. Additionally,the utilities for her home are located in a closet within the second bedroom. When we first came down the stairs,that bedroom smelled strongly like natural gas/chemicals. It was strong enough to cause a headache. I sent Christina a message around 10pm letting her know that I wasn't sure I'd be able to sleep in that room as a result,and asked if she could have someone take a look the next day. Unfortunately,I didn't hear from her for the rest of the trip. The bedroom aired out a bit
All in all,although her home was lovely,I would not recommend this rental if you will need to utilize the second bedroom,"unless something is done to address that issue. \"",,
650956,88226492,2016-07-23,4737279,Brad,"My wife, two kids and I had a wonderful time at Christina's apartment. The location is excellent, right in the South End, less than 10 minutes walk to the Orange Line T station. The apartment was clean and nicely furnished. We made good use of the kids' amenities - the high chair, pack and play, and toys. The lower level bedrooms are a bit dark, but were nice and cool during the hot summer days of our trip. We were very grateful for the AC units in the apartment, as well. Christina was very responsive and easy to work with."
3589267,16632687,2014-07-30,2703551,Chris,Mari's place was great!  We were in town to look at schools and it was just a couple of minutes from Northeastern.  Getting around on public transportation was super easy.  Lots of restaurants within a few minutes walk.  The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe.  A great place to explore Boston from!
3589267,16856640,2014-08-03,1912165,Caroline,"We had a great time in Boston and Mari's place is really well situated. You can walk easily to many places in downtown and to different activities. Also it's only a few minutes of walk to get to different T train stations (metro). It's calm and safe, lots of students around, so very calm during summertime! Mari left us a few goodies and even stuff for our two kids! You've got everything you need there... even too much things! For the moment the place is still very crowded with Mari's stuff! Finally, a lot of upgrades have been recently made and some are still to come. So if you are no looking for a fancy place but more of a fun place to stay, I highly recommend this place. Also for a family of four it was pretty much crowded and luckily there are many great restaurants around! But for one person or a couple the place must be perfect!"

3589267,17118645,2014-08-07,18355131,Kevin,The home was just as described and the neighborhood was perfect. We were able to take the T to Fanuiel Hall and parking was a breeze at the home.
3589267,18252118,2014-08-24,16092941,Igor,"Everything was great!

So, if you trying to find something regular, boring and sterile - that not for you. But if you need something with soul, with history,   with warmth - take it right now!"

The place feels like you are going to a friends house to stay a few days but friend is out of town. We were very comfortable and enjoyed the proximity to my son's camp at Simmon's College. I walked him there every morning. Also, easy walk to many wonderful areas such as Back Bay etc. Whole Foods within three minutes. Mari left teas and other things for us to use which was great since did not have to buy oil etc to create meal. The smoke smell was apparent when first walking into the apartment but once there it goes away since you get used to it. I am a non smoker and sensitive and it was fine. We would come back."

It was an incredibly sweet and thoughtful gesture.  Their space is a duplex in a lovely, bustling, young-spirited area of Boston.  I would definitely recommend to others and am looking forward to staying there again if the circumstances allow.  Thanks Mari and Will, we had a great time!"

Helen is a hospitable, open and friendly person who is easy to chat with.  Her sweet cats are very shy so they only popped in only once in away.  Thank you so very much Helen, for letting me stay in your wonderful home.  I really enjoyed my stay."
4530670,30344054,2015-04-20,29477756,Kiran,"Helen gave a warm welcome, making me a cup of tea in the evening, showing me the house, and inviting me to watch PBS' Masterpiece Theatre in the study.  Antique furniture... oriental carpets... perfect bed and linens... two fluffy cats with fur poking out adorably between the pads of their paws... sun streaming in through the bathroom skylight in the morning... coffee and an English muffin on the deck, breezy and sunny.  What more is there to say?  I've already booked a return."
4530670,31372179,2015-05-04,29477756,Kiran,"This time, I enjoyed morning grapefruit and coffee outside in the garden. Helen showed me her budding viburnum and soaring white birch, and the composting system she's built to feed them. A delight."

She was very easy to communicate with for the check-in and a very nice woman. The bed was very comfortable, the private bathroom was conveniently just across the hallway, and she even told us we could use the adjacent sitting room to store our things if we needed. Overall we were extremely happy with our stay - and such a great price for this beautiful neighborhood just outside of Boston!"

The room and bathroom were absolutely clean. Helen took care for breakfast. We enjoyed sitting on the terrace in the garden.

The room was clean and cozy, and Helen was an amazing host. I found her to be very warm and personable, and enjoyed staying with her so much. I would not hesitate to stay with Helen again next time I'm in the Boston area."
4530670,47960456,2015-09-22,33944284,Michele,Helen was the perfect host. I felt warm and welcomed in her charming New England home. The room was comfortable and clean and it's own good sized bathroom. Her pretty home is on a well maintained quiet street with lots of trees. She also has a lovely garden that looks like it should be in a magazine. Helen was very attentive and helped me decide on things to see and do in Boston. I feel like a made a friend and look forward to another trip in the future. And she makes great coffee!

It's a lovely house in a really lovely and safe neighbourhood, the bed was super-comfy and the place was really clean too. Helen was a great host, we'd never stayed in an airbnb private room before and our experience with Helen has made us keen to do it again. Also-cute cats and decent public transport links into Boston. We'd highly recommend staying here!"

Helen's home was just what we needed! We drove to Boston from Vermont and spent the entire day there,so we didn't get to Helen's house until late. She was extremely accommodating and responsive,leaving the door unlocked for us and leaving the lights of the room and the bathroom we would be using. The room is just like the picture-- Quaint,cozy,and charming! In the morning,she made us coffee and gave us English muffins and fruit and we had a lovely conversation with her (she's super sweet

4530670,53658588,2015-11-10,48195819,Diana,"Ms. Helen is a wonderful host. I have never used air BnB and was worried about my safety as a single woman traveler in a large city. She made me feel right at home as a friend, and not at all like a burden or weird invader. She helped me identify areas on a map that would be worth visiting and met my needs for the trip. She is very knowledgeable about the area."
I greatly enjoyed her company and the company of her beautiful cats. I was able to get a lot of work done on my computer,the room was clean,"and my favorite feature was our morning conversation over coffee and banana bread. There is a shop down the street for groceries as well. \"",,,
4530670,71148221,2016-04-24,52164647,Judy,"Helen is a wonderful host. My boyfriend and I drove from NYC after work to Boston and we didn't get there till almost midnight. Helen was very considerate leaving the front door unlocked and room lights on. The room was really lovely and homey- a comfy bed with clean sheet, fresh towels in the bathroom, and a small bowel of chocolate on the table. My favorite part of staying was our morning conversation. Helen made us fresh brewed coffee and gave us fruits and we talked a lot about travel. Many thanks to Helen, we had a wonderful weekend getaway in Boston!!"

Her house is so very comfortable, cozy, clean and clutter free.  The bed is very comfortable and the fact that I did not have to share the bathroom with anyone was a huge plus.   I thoroughly enjoyed my stay!   Thank you Helen."

We needed an ironing board which she set up for us in the room next to ours and it remained there throughout our stay. She prepared us coffee and breakfast and a thoughtful gift of delicious bread for the road when we checked out. Helen provided directions, the use of an extra Charlie card for the T and dining recommendations. She is a well-traveled, warm and dynamic lady and meeting her enriched our trip."

6685682,55912766,2015-12-07,20720099,Jeffrey,Great place when staying in Back Bay. Very clean and modern. Everything worked well and the door access was simple. My business colleague and I stayed in the two rooms no problem. The bed is comfortable and the sofa bed is sufficient. The location is very convenient for the Hynes (only 2 minutes walk) and for shopping if desired. The metro stop is about 5 minutes stroll away.
Only complaints are the relatively slow internet connection,light sleet noise,and lack of basic toiletries. This was mentioned in the description,so it's no surprise.,,
This is a great alternative to a hotel for business travelers,"and those that do not require the personal touch of staying in someone else's home.\"",,,,

For that reason, we were unable to stay in the apartment. Also, it is an area where on street parking is very difficult. Therefore, we did not actually see the apartment. Jordan was gracious in understanding that we could not stay in the apartment due to the many stairs."

The flat is good to reach by subway and there are shops and bars around. You can walk to Fenway Park in 25 min. There is one large bed upstairs and one small next to the living room. As it was very warm outside during the time we've been there, it got hot upstairs during night, but there is a fan next to the bed, which you can use.  The flat was very clean and nicely furnished.

The apartment is located in the heart of Italy district with plenty restaurant options. It's within walking distance to the city center and main point of interests. Overall good experience. I would not recommend staying to someone with allergy - as there is a dog living in the apartment.

It was an incredible location just steps away from dozens of restaurants, shops, and cafes and there was a pharmacy, corner store, and 7-Eleven right across the street. It was also within walking distance to the Haymarket T stop, the Freedom Trail, the Waterfront, the Aquarium, and Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall. We even happened to go during a weekend where the neighborhood was hosting an Italian Festival with parades, marching bands, food, and music! We adored the neighborhood and we would absolutely stay at Julie's place again!"
We didn't spend much time inside because there was so much to explore,but the place itself was clean and quiet,the bed was comfortable,and the air conditioning was much appreciated! We didn't use the kitchen or the TV but it was nice to know they were there.,,
The only downside was that we underestimated how difficult it would be to find street parking in the area (especially during a festival weekend) as most spaces are reserved for residents with permits and/or had short time limits. We ended up spending much more than we had planned on parking lots. The good news was that there were several lots located at the end of the street so we did not have to walk far. Overall this did not detract from our stay,but it is good to know for next time.,,,,

Super convenient spot for people who want to walk around and explore. Keep in mind there is not much parking on the street so you might have to pay for parking. Do NOT park on the private lot next to the building even if it's for a second, you might get stuck in there (experience speaking here). Overall it was a fantastic place to stay in Boston, highly recommended."

466361,12495596,2014-05-04,13120052,Hyemi,Sarah's house was full of humanity because she really live there. There were everything we need to stay. There were many toys for her son also. We loved her paints and photos on the wall. It seems that I invited to her home as a guest.
466361,14278947,2014-06-16,14079753,Elaine,Sarah kept me updated on everything I needed to know about my stay and was very easy to communicate with. Place was clean and nice and a short distance from Downtown Boston and the surrounds. Would be happy to stay here again on my next trip!
Good thing to know: if looking for a good breakfast joint,check out The Breakfast Club. It's less than a mile walk from Sarah's and the cutest retro restaurant with delicious fresh squeezed orange juice. As far as I can tell there's a line out the door all the time,"but it's not as bad a wait as it would seem and it's worth it anyway. \"",,,
466361,15130886,2014-07-03,1642450,Shauntel,"Sarah and her apartment were perfect for out family!  We couldn't have enjoyed Boston more!  She was really clear about directions and descriptions of how to use the amenities.  The bus stop was 1/2 block from the door.  We felt safe at all hours and felt comfortable leaving the windows open while out.  The washer and dryer in the basement were so helpful and the on street parking amazing.  The apartment itself is small, but has everything you need.  Our family of 4 had no problems.  The kids loved the Wii and we used the computer each morning to plot our days activities.  We also visited the park with the splash pad (a short 15 minute walk away, over the freeway walking bridge) and enjoyed hanging with Boston locals for an evening.  The grocery store was only a 10 minute walk away so we had everything we needed for cooking at the apartment.  Thanks for the use of your spices!  Overall, an excellent experience that leaves us feeling like we lived in Boston for a while.  We appreciate airbnb hosts like Sarah so much!"
466361,15348871,2014-07-07,7993654,JEvz,Me and my famz had a great stay at Sarah's place.

There was plenty of space, and many amenities were provided: wifi, towels, plenty of blankets, TV, etc. The neighborhood was quiet with plenty of street parking and near to many cute restaurants and shops with easy access to Boston city center (at least with a car- I can't speak to public transportation). It was a great place at a great price and awesome for a weekend trip to Boston."

466361,28885244,2015-03-31,58201,Rosalie,"En terme de grandeur, l’appartement de Sarah était parfait pour 5 personnes. Nous avons beaucoup apprécié le fait qu’il y ait du WiFi à l’appartement et qu’une épicerie et un wine shop soient disponibles à distance de marche. Mais bien que nous comprenions que Sarah vivent dans cet appartement, nous aurions apprécié avoir un petit mot nous disant si les draps dans les lits et si les serviettes dans la salle de bain étaient propres ou non. Il aurait été agréable aussi que la vaisselle sale dans le lave-vaisselle et dans le four ait été ramassée. En règle générale, nous avons passé un beau séjour."
466361,31922562,2015-05-11,30116218,Chris & Megan,"Sarah's 2 bedroom apartment in Boston was perfect for our needs. My Partner's parents were visiting us from Australia and wanted to see the east coast of the states. As we had not seen them in some time we were looking for an affordable way to be accommodated all together, so having a 2 bedroom apartment on Boston for the price of a small motel room was amazing. The home was clean, well appointed, and in a great location. There were many restaurants within walking distance and Harvard university is just across the river. The beds were comfortable and the apartment included great amenities such as washer/dryer and wifi. Megan's parents loved the opportunity to see inside a locals home to get a feel of how locals live. We would recommend Sarah's home to anyone travelling to Boston, it really made our trip comfortable and memorable."

466361,74516856,2016-05-15,61096581,David,"We arrived late at night and it was a pretty quiet community. Easy to access to the apt. Like the lovely paintings on the wall. Like the neat bedrooms and clean blankets. Friendly bath amenities. One pitfall is the parking. We didn't have any available private spot so we could only park the car in the drive way, which blocked the way of neighbor's car. We should've be warned before hand."
466361,83719744,2016-07-04,80594629,Jude,"We had a great time at Sarah's place. Perfect for our situation, and our son loved staying in the child's room with the snake. It was so homey it was like we lived there. My partner and I liked waking up to the view of the art on the ceiling. This was our first Airbnb experience and we are sold!"
466361,88785285,2016-07-25,11621980,Jeff,What a great place!  Sarah's apartment was ideal for our group - centrally located and great for a weekend at Fenway and the downtown historic sites.  We also loved her artwork - such a unique experience.

1821633,8395985,2013-10-28,9576317,Pascal,What an amazing experience. Bruce and Barry were the most graciuous hosts you could find. Te BNB is neatly located in a calm little neigbourhood and is very close to the subwy line. In less than 10minutes you can be in downtown Boston.
"Would recommend to anyone going to Boston!\"",,,,,
1821633,8593971,2013-11-06,9097679,Kathy,"I felt very pampered during my stay there.  I was in town for a conference, while I only had one evening and a 1/2 day for sightseeing, due to their care I was able to get a feel for the city and get some great photographs (a hobby of mine).  The quality is excellent, from details such as orange juice in the morning (from Trader Joes) to the best shower I have had in years (they remodeled for the B&B business, rewiring and plumbing -- commercial water heater).  The bathrooms and kitchen were renovated without impacting the Victorian charm of the home.  I booked late, 10pm and by noon the room was confirmed for my arrival the next day.  I didn't rent a car, yet had no problem getting to/from the Boston Convention Center or the Airport.  It was an excellent first experience with AirBnb and I will always think fondly of Bruce and Barry.  I used to travel internationally for business, and the quality was more pleasing than the 4 star hotels the company booked."
1821633,8677312,2013-11-11,9107838,Danielle,"Very beautiful house and room with everything needed.  Bruce and Barry are also very good hosts, I enjoyed my stay there very much!"
1821633,11028275,2014-03-17,10097759,Corinna Und Till,This was my second stay at Bruces house and it was as great as the first time. I brought in my husband and he was as thrilled as I was. Bruce and Barry organized a St. Patricks Day Party and invited us at once. It was so amazing and Bruce is such a great cook. We would have loved to stay longer but we had to go home. Whenever we come to Boston again we will stay there. Bruce and Barry are the best hosts you can imagine. I recommended this house to my family. They will stay there to. I am excited to hear how they liked it.
1821633,11225482,2014-03-25,966035,Susan,"My husband and I had an excellent experience with our stay at Bruce's bnb.  The room was clean and comfortable, great view of the water and walk to the beach. It was a perfect location for us to visit with family living nearby and the Red Line T.  The pick up and drop off service to the airport was a great bonus!  Our host was informative about the area, and things to do.  Thanks, Bruce."

The room is in a 19th century purple villa filled with wonderful furniture and artwork and a few pooches. Our hosts were amazing, offering lots of help and advice and a lovely breakfast in the morning. Apart from this, they also gave our relative a room short notice without prebooking. The room itself is extremely spacious and bright and the bed doesn't just look cool, it's also very comfortable. We want to come back!"
1821633,13520973,2014-05-29,13916979,Jamie,"Bruce and Barry were great hosts, happy to advise on places to go and things to do in Boston. Savin Hill is a quiet and picturesque area of Boston, hard to believe that it is only a few minutes on the train/drive from the city center. Bruce and Barry's house itself is beautiful to the last detail and our room was spacious with great furnishings including a ceiling fan for hot evenings. The house is very peaceful but could be very social if you wish, with Bruce and Barry very hospitable and warm. Highly recommended if you are visiting Boston."
"Barry was even kind enough to drop us off at the train station upon check out. Thank you both!\"",,,,,

The house is beautiful and the bedding is comfortable. The room may be a little noisy because of the airplanes flying above the house,but the neighborhood is really nice.,,,,
The house is ten minute walk to the subway station,and then you can be in Boston downtown very fast.,,,,
I highly recommend!,,,,,
Bruce et Barry sont des hôtes absolument charmants et extrêmement sympathiques. Nos baguages ont été perdus par la compagnie aérienne et ils nous ont beaucoup aidé à les récupérer. Ils nous ont aussi servi un copieux petit déjeuner chaque matin.,,,,,
Leur maison est magnifique et la literie était confortable. La chambre peut être un peu bruyante par moment car les avions passent au dessus de la maison,mais le voisinage est vraiment agréable.,,,,
La maison se trouve à dix minutes à pied d'une station de métro depuis laquelle on peut rejoindre très rapidement le centre ville de Boston.,,,,,

The house was built in the 1800's, was truly remarkable, and retained a lot of its original charm.  Our room was spacious and comfortable and breakfast the next morning was delightful!"
1821633,14568403,2014-06-22,2663569,Patricia,"We arrived in Boston from Europe a bit stressed and with some trying circumstances.  Bruce picked us up from the airport and was supportive and helpful.

We didn't get to ride on the train,but it looked like it's around 10 minutes walk from the house to the station. The neighborhood is safe too! Not forgetting,the beach is just a short walk from the house,"and provides a nice place for a picnic or some quiet time.\"",,
1821633,15768491,2014-07-15,16506842,Alison,"Bruce and Barry are terrific hosts-- warm and friendly and experienced with the protocol of a traditional B & B. When we arrived in the late afternoon, Barry invited us to join him for a walk with their poodles, and took us on a delightful tour of their gorgeous neighborhood that cradles the waterfront.  They gave us suggestions for restaurants and nearby attractions.  It's easy and safe to walk to the subway.  We enjoyed an evening of resting and reading in our room, which was spotless and comfy. They invited us into their dreamy kitchen to grab breakfast in the morning, and had we not been pressed for time we would have stayed.  The other guests in the house are quiet and respectful of each other."

The room was precisely as in the picture. The house is ideally situated in a very quiet district typically American  houses in wood,and very close to the subway (red line) thus is at less than half an hour to  any center of interest.,,,,
Bruce and Barry are very friendly and help every host as well as possible. Bruce loves cooking and we could apreciate his talent for organizing party.,,,,,

Breakfast fare was available to us in their kitchen which was very well appointed.  And at times we were able to share a glass of wine in the evening.  What more do you need?,,,,,
For those who may be allergic to dogs,there are two well behaved small dogs which were never troublesome.,,,,
"Highly recommend.  They will be the first ones we contact when we return to Boston.\"",,,,,
1821633,18086885,2014-08-21,17927432,Amanda,"Bruce and Bary we're great hosts and made our first AirBnB experience a great one.  Despite arriving early, they made us feel welcome and accommodated us.  The house and room was gorgeous and the neighborhood quiet.  Easy to get to and great access to the T.  Ours was a quick one night stay so we didn't get to hang around long past the nice breakfast Bruce cooked up for us.  Would definitely recommend to others!"
1821633,18245384,2014-08-24,7580251,Francis,"Bruce and Barry have been wonderful hosts, and they made us feel at home the very first day. They are two very generous persons. They were available if we needed informations or help - and it was nice to discuss with them on different topics."

Charming home, very comfortable, close to the T and they offered good tips on sightseeing and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again if the opportunity ever arises."
1821633,19669877,2014-09-16,16567446,Frank,"Bruce and Barry made our stay in Boston pretty enjoyable – we  felt welcome at once. Their house is gorgeous, it is furnished with love and very clean. Their little dogs are cute und their patience with our bad English was unlimited! We would come back anytime, thanks to you!"

1821633,20561617,2014-10-01,13526375,Dorinda,"Barry and  Bruce were incredibly friendly, even offering wine and cooking dinner at times during my stay there. There were lots of other guests and so it was nice to swap stories and tips with other people. The room was very spacious and clean and it was easy to get to downtown Boston on public transport. I would definitely recommend this to people !"

1821633,21214947,2014-10-13,15071102,Adriana,"\"Our host, Bruce, called us to make sure he would not be away when we arrived. He made us feel comfortable immediately upon our arrival! The home is located in a lovely, quiet, and safe-feeling street and only a short walk to the \"\"T\"\" for easy commuting into the various areas of Boston."
The home and guest room are very clean and the bed extremely comfortable. The shared bathroom was clean,had an incredible shower,and was always available when we needed it.,,,
A variety of good breakfast items were available for our morning start each day which was an added bonus we were not expecting. Bruce loves to cook so incredibly,delicious scents greeted us often upon arrival 'home' from our wonderings.,,,,
Our hosts were easy-going and had a great sense of humor; they answered our many questions regarding places to see and how to get around. Their two miniature poodles were friendly,well-behaved,and welcoming as well. The house felt like a home  and our stay was most comfortable.,,,
"We would return and refer our friends and family there without hesitation.\"",,,,,
1821633,21379543,2014-10-16,17858853,Deb,"Bruce & Barry were wonderful hosts.

"Highly recommended!!\"",,,,,
1821633,21701581,2014-10-22,709648,Grania,"We just spent 5 nights in Boston with Bruce and Barry and loved it. They are warm and friendly, have a charming and comfortable home in a nice quiet neighborhood. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom sharing was no problem and clean when we used it, and it was just 2 blocks from the T station."
"Even more fun was the interaction with others in the house. While we were there several graduate students from US and other countries were staying and one lively evening around the dining table was a real treat. We'd definitely stay there again when in Boston.\"",,,,,
1821633,21759454,2014-10-23,8494358,Bill,"What a beautiful home, and such nice people! I wish I'd had more time to spend with Bruce and Barry. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and they were so willing to go above and beyond to make me feel comfortable. Highly recommended."
1821633,22019607,2014-10-28,5966015,Kajira,"It was wet and cold and at night and Bruce met us, helped us with our bags, carried them even upstairs to our room! Such a love,y friendly greeting."
1821633,22318314,2014-11-03,22371730,Eddy,Bruce and Barry were great hosts. The house was clean and cozy.  I felt at ease from our initial interaction.  I stayed for 5 days in a beautiful room.  The bed was  very comfrotable.  The neighborhood was safe and quiet.  Being at walking distance from the T was a treat.  I had a lovely stay.  I enjoyed the night when they invited me to join them for dinner with another housemate.  Thank you for a great first experience with AirBnB.
1821633,23206278,2014-11-25,259016,Barbara R,"\"Barry greeted us at the door with a big smile, which set the tone for our stay. The room was just as we expected, with a very comfortable bed.  Since we were there for just one night after more than 14 hours of travel, we just wanted to eat, unwind and go to sleep. It was a five minute walk to a reasonable priced eatery with decent food. On the way we passed the \"\"T\"\""
1821633,24850417,2015-01-03,6862439,Keena,This is my second time staying at Bruce and Barry's. I had such a great time this summer... that it was a no brainer when I was traveling back to Boston to stay with them again. They are such delightful and accommodating gentlemen. The house was decorated beautifully for the holidays. I was even fortunate enough to be there for a New Year brunch they threw. Excellent hosts through and through! They are my go to Boston destination!
1821633,30437706,2015-04-22,22583252,Catherine,"My husband and I were in Boston for 4 nights for the Marathon, and Barry and Bruce could not have been more welcoming, accommodating and helpful. We arrived late Friday night, but we were welcomed with a hearty split pea broth, easy conversation and a hello from Jasmine and Tank (their friendly rescue Poodles….or 'Chien Bizarre' as the warning sign describes them!) Breakfast every morning was a chilled and unobtrusive affair, with guests having the run of the kitchen and breakfast ingredients. Their property was minutes from the T, which was great for my husband's early morning race day travel to Boston Common, easily in time for gear check and his transfer to the start. Moreover our hosts were always ready to advise on transport options and places to visit. The four-poster bed was one of the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in and the rain shower in the bathroom was something else; more than enough to ease my husband's aching limbs post-marathon. All-in-all we a great stay and would love to stay again next time we're in Boston. Thanks guys!"
1821633,31410036,2015-05-04,32260832,Phil,"The hosts, Bruce and Barry, made us feel very welcome, telling us about local places to eat and visit, showing us the way down to the beach, sharing wine, and generally creating a convivial atmosphere. The place itself is great, cute dogs, lots of fun and funky decorations and a very pleasant, quaint neighborhood that is easily accessible. In the morning, we all gathered in the kitchen and they made a huge breakfast. The food was delicious. To top it all off, they kindly gave us a ride back to the bus station so we wouldn't miss our bus. It was nice enough to make us want to stay longer. Hopefully we can return soon. First experience with Air BnB, and a very good one."
1821633,31621628,2015-05-07,12096536,Marie,"This was my first but not last time staying with Bruce. I was welcomed warmly into their home and met some of the other guests. The room was great. Comfortable bed, plenty of room and the shared bathroom was right next door and I never felt like it was shared."
Parking off the street is a plus and the location is prime.,,,,,
"I felt very welcomed into their home and will be back.\"",,,,,
1821633,32348170,2015-05-17,30417746,Matthew,"Bruce was very accommodating in terms of checking-in. He was very clear on when the room would be available and that we could drop our luggage off if we arrived early. The neighborhood is wonderfully quaint and full of 17th century homes, including Bruce's. Our room was far from boring and was decorated with great pieces of art. Our bed was a Tempurpedic-style mattress that made sleep come easily. Bruce and Barry had all the necessary amenities available for us (including plenty of towels). Our breakfast was fresh fruit, toast, coffee and juice and was just what we needed to get the day started. Bruce and Barry were wonderful hosts and I got the impression that they truly enjoy having guests stay with them. We were in a full house but I felt that our privacy was always respected. Our stay was short, but I will definitely be back when we return to Boston."
1821633,32641936,2015-05-19,22613476,Adriaan,Lovely neighborhood!
1821633,32893539,2015-05-23,30066467,Ruth E,"Barry and Bruce are wonderful hosts and made me feel right at home. By the end of the week, I felt as if they were longtime friends of mine. The room is lovely and the bed very comfy -- I slept like a log.  The house is clean and nicely appointed, with an especially welcoming kitchen.  The porch, yard and gardens are also quite pleasant."
The location on Savin Hill is ideal.  A majestic old neighborhood with quiet streets,"but a subway stop only a short walk away. Also the home is only a few blocks from a neighborhood retail district that includes several good restaurants. A brief subway ride takes you right into the heart of Boston.\"",,,,
1821633,33598179,2015-05-30,25278619,Rhoda,"Bruce & Barry were wonderful hosts for our short stay, helping us sort out directions and transportation.  Their home is beautiful and the room we stayed in lovingly appointed and clean.  We would definitely stay with them again on our next trip to UMass."

The restaurant that Bruce recommends to us is really good!I really don't want to leave. I hope I have the chance to come back here in the future!I love Bruce 's house more than Boston.if you have the chance to stay in Boston,choose Bruce 's house without hesitation!"

1821633,34672994,2015-06-10,17736032,Sally,"Barry made me feel welcome and comfortabl including a large pot of delicious french press coffee in the morning. Their home and the atmosphere is very relaxed which is important to me on a business trip. The neighborhood is lovely, the location is convenient to UMass Boston, the airport and downtown. I highly recommend Bruce and Barry's place."

1821633,34809531,2015-06-12,6589676,Tre,"We were welcomed even though we were running behind, the listing was accurate and nice and the neighborhood was quiet but so close to the T!"
1821633,35116830,2015-06-15,33527195,Lucy,"My wife and I spent a lovely weekend with Bruce and Barry.  We visited our daughter while in Boston, and rather than crowd her apartment in Dorchester, we decided to take advantage of the owner's hospitality.  The house is a picture-perfect Victorian home that is stuffed with vintage antiques and decorated with flair.  We slept on the fourposter bed pictured here, in an upstairs, air-conditioned room that faced the street, yet our nights were nonetheless quiet and extremely comfortable.  The shared bathroom had current, up-to-date fixtures, including a multi-head shower and heated towel-drying rack. The home dated from the 1890s, but was firm and level as a brick, built on bedrock.  Our hosts made us as welcome as could be: when we arrived the first night, a sumptuous dinner party was in progress and although the stuffed squash blossoms looked delicious, when Bruce offered to include us, we had to decline, having just finished dinner ourselves (although Bruce is an accomplished private chef).   Bruce and Barry treated us like family along with the other guests, whom had we not seen we would never had known were sleeping in the same house.  We were offered amenities from the well-appointed kitchen: fresh filtered water, coffees and teas (one of our hosts brewed a delicious cup of coffee himself for us on our first morning), fresh breads and fruits, and were told the local history and suggestions for dining out and touring. All in all, we couldn't have felt more welcome or made more comfortable even though our time there was limited.  We both felt that not only had we made the right choice in choosing a bed-and-breakfast over a hotel for our stay, we had also had a unique opportunity to savor the character and charm of real, true Boston, instead of the antiseptic, anonymous efficiency of a standard room at a hotel chain. This was part of the reason why this visit was such a memorable experience."
1821633,35390988,2015-06-18,1904860,Megan,"Barry and Bruce were my first Airbnb experience and they definitely made me want to continue.  I was in Boston for a conference and even though my days were full and exhausting they made my homecoming comfortable and welcoming.  The room was a nice size, the bed more comfortable than any hotel bed and I never felt like I had to compete for the bathrooms.  It rained two out of the 3.5 days I was there and one day I was running late to the Boston Convention Center.  Barry insisted on taking me all the way to the convention center so as to avoid the pouring rain and trains."
They were a wealth of local info,their home is beautiful with many wonderful antiques and in a lovely neighborhood in dorchester,close to the T. They also provide coffee and self-serve breakfast were available every morning.  The house was full with students from other countries and it was wonderful to meet so many people.  I feel like I truly got to know Boston even though my days were at the convention center and I just spent three days there. Next time i'm in Boston,"I'll be back. \"",,
1821633,35776039,2015-06-22,29001773,Laura,It was close proximity to bus line to go to many places in Boston. The house had authentic style with modern conveniences. It was very nice to have breakfast every morning before sightseeing. Barry gave great tips on what to see and where to go.
1821633,36078518,2015-06-25,9015246,Cynthia,"My husband and I very much enjoyed our brief stay with Bruce and Barry and their two cute miniature poodles. We ended up staying in a different room so I can't comment directly on this room. The bed we had was very comfortable, the room furnishings were fun and eclectic, and we had a fan to keep us cool at night. The bathroom is a shared bath, but we didn't see or hear anyone else use it, so it felt like a private bathroom. (Note: There were two different full baths available for guest use.) The neighborhood is beautiful (you can actually see the water from their street) and we felt very safe walking back to the house from the subway.  We didn't spend any time on the veranda, but it looked lovely and there were many beautiful plants and flowers. There are two rooms in the house that are for AirBNB use and other rooms are rented out long-term to students. (These are mostly students doing graduate work, so it's very quiet and not at all a party atmosphere). There are breakfast items available in the morning as well as a filtered water dispenser, tea & coffee available at any time. We were on the 3rd floor which was fine for us, but just a point for anyone who has difficulty with stairs. A very nice experience and we would not hesitate to stay here again."
1821633,36471071,2015-06-28,7896726,Jess,"Bruce was very accommodating, he let us drop off our bags ealy before check-in so we could explore. The house is incredible! The room was awesome and eclectic. The bed was soo comfortable. I wish we could have stayed longer."
1821633,36591932,2015-06-29,31242724,Phil,Great place!  Bruce and Barry are excellent hosts and were very accommodating. Excellent location to downtown and very comfortable room and amenities.
1821633,37305076,2015-07-06,29939529,Pamela,"Barry and Bruce have a lovely home!  I stayed with my teenage daughter and we were actually in a different room that this one, and it had a separate area for my daughter to retreat to!  Loved the house and the neighborhood.  Short walk to the T, and the ice cream shop, and cafe.  Stayed a week and truly wanted to stay longer.  Barry is such a fun, warm person who was really enjoyable to get to know.  He even took us to the boat on the day we were heading over to  Cape Cod so we wouldn't have to catch the T  over there that morning.  He also would not let me call a cab when it was time to leave, instead getting up at 4:30am to take us to the airport.  Other guests from various countries are staying long term and attending school and were fun to meet."
If and when I return,"there is no doubt that I will stay here again!\"",,,,
1821633,37677896,2015-07-09,557491,Gail,"My mom and I visited Boston for four days and we had an incredible experience at Bruce's BNB.  The neighbourhood is very quant and feels like you are outside of the city, but it is very accessible to public transit.  Barry and Bruce were a pleasure to spent time with and made our stay very comfortable.  We highly recommend.  Thank you Barry and Bruce."
1821633,37843207,2015-07-11,259016,Barbara R,"We absolutely loved staying here last year so we decided to make this our hub for a vacation that sent us to Vermont for a wedding,  and Long Island for a reunion.  We had three separate stays over a two week vacation.  Bruce and Barry were very generous with their time and we felt as though we were visiting long time friends.  Thanks to Barry, who drove ahead of us to show us the way, our last evening was spent enjoying a great meal at the restaurant 224 Boston Street."

The bedroom we stayed in was like a haven and the bed was so very comfortable. Bruce and Barry were  delightful.  They visited with us and gave us input on our trip into Boston and answered any questions we had.  Abby LOVED the culinary input from Bruce :)  Breakfast was wonderful and all the little extra \"\"tastes\"\" from around the world added to our delight.  Wish we could have stayed longer.\""

All weekend they made sure I was well fed and had everything I needed; it was like being at home. Their house is absolutely beautiful, clean, and orderly and the neighborhood is very quiet and everyone I encountered in the area was very friendly. There are several awesome places to eat within walking distance and nearby subway access. If you are looking for a place to stay, this is it!"

1821633,42141357,2015-08-11,32801166,Lisa,"We had a wonderful time in Boston, our hosts made our stay very pleasant and enjoyable. By the time we left, it felt like we were part of a new family. The international students staying in other rooms were perfectly pleasant! We chose to not rent a car and instead use public transportation to get around for sight-seeing and the house's proximity to the subway station was great. Thank you for the opportunity to experience more of Boston than we ever would have from a standard hotel room. Highly recommended!"
1821633,46298208,2015-09-09,4683468,Nicki,Bruce and Barry were excellent hosts. The house was full of character and our room was perfect for our needs with an extremely comfortable bed. The house was near the subway so easy to get into Boston which was why we were there. We would certainly like to stay again should we return to the area and would highly recommend.

1821633,49893156,2015-10-07,11615527,Amy,"Bruce and Barry made me feel welcome in their home. The have some long-term guests who are students, so they're really experienced with their set up. This particular room is large and clean, the bed is comfortable, and it has both an AC unit and a space heater! This came in really handy since I had a couple days of high humidity followed by cold, windy rain. The morning light is great for waking up naturally and you can serve yourself breakfast in the well-appointed downstairs kitchen."
Shared bathrooms were really clean. There's another upstairs from this room in case someone is using the one on the same floor. I LOVED the heated air you can turn on.,,,,,
As a single female traveler I was a little concerned that there weren't locks on the room doors,but it wasn't a problem at all. I had a doorstop for peace of mind,but otherwise it was unnecessary. I was also a little concerned when I mapped the walk from the station to the house,but it's a safe neighborhood. Quiet (in a good way!),but not too quiet. The walk is quick and the red line was really convenient for getting to or connecting to other parts of the city. Quick transfer to the silver to the airport,too.
"Bruce and Barry can give you tips on where to eat and what to see in the city. Their home is really beautiful. They had pumpkins out for Halloween. :) The dogs are fun when you're coming back for the evening. I would definitely stay here again!\"",,,,,
1821633,50123233,2015-10-09,8956399,Joe,"Bruce and Barry had the most gorgeous home and were the most accommodating hosts. A family emergency arose and I only ended up staying one night. The bedroom was super comfortable, the bathroom was wonderful, and Bruce and Barry let me leave my bag for the day. Breakfast was great, they were super convenient to the Red Line T and Savin Hill is a pretty neighborhood. I would love to return, if they will have me."

1821633,50723136,2015-10-13,45370161,Felix,Bruce was very helpful and kind. The house is wonderful and big. Also our room was rather big. I would stay again with Bruce in Boston and then hopefully longer than 1 night.
1821633,51142993,2015-10-18,21860914,Julia,"Bruce and Barry were two very friendly hosts and we had a brilliant stay, even if it was only for a night. Your house is a must-see: we loved the antique interior and the furniture, above all the massive queen-size bed. Perfectly clean shared bathrooms and a cosy built-in shared kitchen, there is absolutely nothing to complain about, even if we wished ;-) Thanks again for the warm welcome and all the good tips! We really loved the stunning walk along the shore and the JFK library!"

We were warmly welcomed, and given a full tour of this amazing house upon our arrival. Bruce and Barry are the epitome of what good hosts are, and we lacked nothing during our stay. They were generous with their advice on what to see and do in Boston, and made sure our time there was well spent. The bedroom was gorgeous, spotlessly clean and the bed wonderfully comfortable. The bathroom could pass for one in an expensive hotel. The house is located in a lovely neighbourhood that was most pleasant to walk through in the fall. The metro station is a short walk away, and the ride into town is short. We could not have asked for a better end to our holiday in the US!"
1821633,53066466,2015-11-04,20135272,Ryan,"Wonderful host. Great place in a great location with extremely friendly and helpful hosts. If I get the chance to visit Boston again in the future, then I will definitely see if there is availability at this host first."

Barry was a great host and gave us lots of great tips for our stay. The house is a few minute walk from the train line so it's very handy for getting into Boston. We will definitely recommend a stay here."

1821633,69544654,2016-04-11,30320236,Aggy,"My husband and I were visiting our daughter in Braintree and we needed a place to stay close by.  The location of this house was perfect, for SO many reasons.  The neighborhood is great (and quiet!) and it's a quick trip into Boston (and into Braintree and the surrounding areas).  The very best part, though, was the house itself, and the hosts!  Gorgeous, impeccably clean, antique home, filled with beautiful antiques and wonderful collections from all over the world!  The bed was very comfortable and the whole house felt like home.  Our hosts were wonderfully warm and friendly, and we plan to stay there again the next time we visit our daughter.  Highly recommended!"

1821633,81014482,2016-06-20,62024475,Emil,"By far the best AIRBnB we've stayed in so far. Barry was the man on the scene as Bruce was in Europe and he was a wonderful, knowledgeable, welcoming host. The house is a museum of diverse art pieces in a quite neighborhood. The bedroom is large, filled with light and also with unique pieces. Barry provided a variety of fresh fruit, breads, juice and cereals along with French press coffee. The red transit line is an eight minute walk giving access to every corner of greater Boston.  Barry's suggestions for sights and restaurants were spot on."

My boyfriend and I felt very comfortable in their home--it was clean, beautiful and welcoming. This part of Dorchester is full of large Victorian homes and about a 10 minute from the Savin Hill T stop off of the red line. Very easy to get into the city. I highly recommend staying with them and hope I can do so again!"

Bruce was out of town but Barry greeted us as soon as we pulled up. He was such gracious and friendly host. He made sure we had everything we needed and offered recommendations for things to do in Boston. The house it self was charming. The room and bathroom were very clean and neatly kept. We enjoyed all the poodle decor too! Wish we stayed longer than one night. Overall, I highly recommend this Bnb to anyone. We will definitely choose this Bnb again the next time we are in town!"

What can i say,i may have to find new words to explain her as a host. The best host i have ever had in an airbnb space.,,,,
Also this place just 1 minute walk from T Redline station.,its the closest place you can get to a Redline,,,,
She is very creative with her place and will make you feel at home. There is nothing that will make you feel uncomfortable in her presence. The music,the cat(poochie),everything in this place is so welcoming.,,,
I recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston,,,,,
"Take care alexia.... be happy and enjoy..\"",,,,,

11584799,71369067,2016-04-25,67501503,Damon,"Alexia was incredibly welcoming and her place is really beautiful, spacious, and cosy. It is adorned with interest artifacts and trinkets from around the world. She made my brother and I feel very at home from the moment we walked in and looked after us throughout our trip. We spent most of the time at the convention center which was about 15 minute drive away - close to the train too - but we didn't take take that as we were looking for a place with private parking which she has. We also had a lot of fun just hanging out each day and at the end of it we agreed it was the best AirBnB we had stayed at, and we felt like we really lucked-out! We go to Boston once a year for the PAX Game show so we hope she's still there next year too."
11584799,73593724,2016-05-08,34946167,Vineet,"It's a beautiful house and Alexia is a great host. She is helpful and easy to get along with, friendly. She went beyond what we expected and made us feel as comfortable as possible. Delicious breakfast cookies were a surprise and Thank you for them."
11584799,74865143,2016-05-17,70190485,Travis,Alexia was an amazing host. She went out of her way to make sure that we were comfortable the entire time. She had great suggestions of places to visit and was available any time for help or to answer questions. The place was beautiful and very clean. Having private parking and being right next to the subway was a huge advantage and made the trip that much better. I will definitely try to book here if I'm ever in Boston again.
11584799,80511381,2016-06-18,7978141,Giulia,"Alexia è un host perfetto, ha in sè la dote dell'accoglienza delle persone, sa prendersi cura delle persone in ogni momento, dalle indicazioni per raggiungere il suo alloggio, ai dettagli curati in casa, alla totale disponibilità per ogni bisogno. Oltre alla bellezza della persona che è Alexia, anche la casa è degna di nota in quanto rispecchia lei. E' curata, accogliente, luminosa, spaziosa, vicina alla fermata della metro con cui si può raggiungere facilmente il centro di Boston in 20 minuti."
La scelta di questo alloggio per la mia permanenza a Boston,la rifarei oggi stesso in quanto non potevo pensare di trovarmi meglio.,,,,
Non solo Alexia,ma anche Minshu la coinquilina di Alexia è una persona speciale. Sa anche lei aiutare e coinvolgere le persone in tutto quello di cui possono avere bisogno. E poi il fantastico Poochie,l'uomo di casa,il gatto più affettuoso che abbia mai incontrato.,,
Spero che le mie parole siano abbastanza descrittive dell'esperienza fantastica che è la permanenza presso la casa di Alexia,"perchè è bella la casa e sono altrettanto stupende le persone che si incontrano.\"",,,,
11584799,88534547,2016-07-24,7978141,Giulia,Alexia è una padrona di casa stupenda: mi ha accolto calorosamente e mi ha fatto sentire subito a casa; è sempre molto disponibile e veramente attenta alle esigenze di tutti gli ospiti. Ma c'è di più: Alexia è capace di prevedere le esigenze degli ospiti e di anticiparle senza chiedere.
La casa,dotata di tutto ciò che serve per vivere al meglio,è al secondo piano di tre totali,ed è arredata con gusto ed è sita in un quartiere tranquillo,infatti è comodissima per andare in centro a Boston con la metro oppure Uber o car sharing.,
In casa il vero padrone di casa è il gatto,Poochie,che mi è sempre stato vicino; è veramente di compagnia e molto affettuoso.,,,
Alexia,inoltre,ha un ottimo gusto musicale e con lo stereo che diffonde la musica in tutta casa e la libreria musicale immensa,abbiamo avuto un sottofondo musicale come una colonna sonora delle giornate passate assieme.,,
"La casa è molto pulita e ordinata; il parquet in legno dona all'ambiente un tocco raffinato e veramente di atmosfera. Amo fare colazione sul balcone con il canto degli uccelli al mattino. Il tempo passato assieme a Alexia e Minshu è stato bellissimo. Alexia è una fotografa bravissima e mi ha fatto alcune foto che sono veramente stupende. Ci tornerò sicuramente.\"",,,,,

It is true when people say that it's the little details that make a difference,that's what you find all over Alexia's home.,,,,
It is very homey and cosy,a place where you can really rest and relax. Everything in the house is 200 times better then described.,,,,
You would never regret staying here.,,,,,
Also it is in a very convenient location,the subway is just around the corner and you can move very easily to everywhere in the city.,,,,
"Alexia has definitely earned the \"\"super host\"\" title. She cares about you and is always in contact",she makes sure that you are all right and that you have everything you need. She also gives you very good tips and suggestions about what to do and where to go. She suggested visiting Rockport,little fishers man town with best fresh lobster ever had.,,,

Hannah was very welcoming and even offered food and snacks for the guests. She was easy to contact throughout my stay and replied very quickly to any inquiries or messages.,,,,,
I would highly recommend staying here,"you will not be disappointed!\"",,,,
13041752,77515898,2016-06-01,14487964,Lianne,"Hannah is amazing! She's quick to respond to messages (even if late at night/early AM EST)! I picked Hannah's place because it looked so clean, welcoming, and was so close to the station. It did not disappoint. The location is a little bit further out from most of the tourist attractions in Boston, but I would totally stay again in the future. Hannah is also one of the sweetest, most hospitable people I know. As I was getting ready to head to the airport, I found out my flight was cancelled and was in a pinch on time and figuring things out, Hannah did not hesitate to offer her help - and did so throughout the stay even if she was working late. Hannah also offered full access to the kitchen with complimentary filtered water, tea, coffee, snacks, and cup-noodles. As mentioned before, I would stay again in the future even with Jamaica Plains being a bit further out."
13041752,78394593,2016-06-06,28022221,Luis,This location was perfect for me because I was using public transportation. One block away from the train station and super close to places to eat. The house was very organized and clean. Hannah was very helpful and polite. She have notes in the common areas so you can find everything you need around the house. I will recommend everyone to stay here!

13041752,84634145,2016-07-08,53866527,Catherine,"At every turn Hannah was responsive and welcoming. The apartment is very close to the subway station. It is on the ground floor, so you don't need to carry a bag upstairs. I loved it that Hannah does not allow outdoor shoes inside; the place is spotless. There is a good-sized living room, dining room and kitchen. One thing that distinguished Hannah's place from others I have stayed in, aside from the welcome cleanliness, is that it is not cluttered up with personal bits and pieces. The building is on a quiet dead end street. The neighborhood of Jamaica Plains is simply wonderful and convinced me that Boston has not lost its soul after all. It is full of interesting independent cafes and restaurants of all cultures, and has its own bookstore.  My favourite place was Cafe Beirut. The apartment is also near that jewel in Boston's crown, the Arboretum. I will be back."
13041752,85794911,2016-07-13,75363669,Olga,"I enjoyed staying with Hannah very much. The room was small, but clean and there were necessary things. The advantage of the accommodation is that you could wash and dry your clothes free of charge and you can have some food (noodle soup) and tea or coffee."
There was also a file with all the rules,maps,and recommendations for dining and entertaining,which was very useful. The area is safe,very close to subway,perfect transportation. It is only a pity I didn´t meet Hannah personally

The kitchen and bathroom are large, clean and well-furnished  All appliances were clean and worked, which was a great convenience, because I cook for myself. Even the large fridge accommodated every guest's perishables.Finally,the washing  maschine and dryer performed perfectly. The door was securely locked. The windows function well I could reach Hannah by SMS and she always quickly responded. The air conditioning worked well and quietly.  The living room was comfortable. No street noise or rowdy neighbors, Finally, Hannah's guide to the neighborhood was helpful and extensive. Even a fine farmers' co.operative was nearby. When I return to Beantown, I will reserve a room at Hannah's again. I may stay for a month."
13041752,90330592,2016-07-31,8717561,Peggy,I had a most pleasant and comfortable stay at Hannah's.  She keeps her lovely place very clean and tidy.

We felt safe in the neighborhood and the T station (and rental bikes) are close. Nigel and Eva are not living in the appartment but their friendly chinese mother is. They were very responsive via Email and we felt welcome."
6088708,35756016,2015-06-21,3112616,Kate,"The room was easy to find, lovely, and just as pictured. I had a restful evening. Thanks, Nigel and Eva!"
6088708,36223390,2015-06-26,16426314,Qinjie,"Nigel has a really awesome and pretty home to offer. The room we stayed in was fantastic and looked exactly like the pictures (or even better) - neat, comfortable, had everything that we needed for a good stay! The toilet was clean and great. The location of the house is great too; just a short walk from the station with several convenience stores nearby."
Most importantly,Nigel and his mum-in-law were really great hosts and warm people who never hesitated for a good chat (& delicious home cooked food to accompany as well!) It's a pity that we didn't get to meet Eva!,,,,
Thanks very much for the great hospitality! We had a good stay and felt at home. For travelers looking for a great place in Boston - stay at Nigel's and Eva's! You won't regret,"we promise :)\"",,,,
6088708,38428559,2015-07-15,36890272,Kim,"The room was immaculate!  It's really great to have your own bathroom, too.  The bed is just a mattress, without a box spring, so if you're not a good sleeper, this might be an issue.  It's quite convenient to the Red Line T.  Very nice people."
6088708,38568868,2015-07-16,3714598,Corrine,The space was clean and bright.  Good location for me.  Quiet and comfortable.  They've created a nice space here.  A cab from here would get you anywhere downtown Boston in less than 10 minutes.

The place was a short walk from the subway station, as well as some good restaurants. Parking was difficult when we arrived, but it was free. Hosts were kind and friendly, and we had all the privacy we needed. Nigel greeted us when we arrived, and there was a handy info sheet on the desk in the room that had a lot of helpful information and local recommendations."

Coming from Belgium we arrived late in Boston. Luckily we had no trouble finding Eva and Nigel's place. Although it was quite late,they give us a warm welcome. We stayed in a clean room and bathroom hosted by two lovely people.  This airbnb is well located,close to the subway,2 subway stops away from the center,and close to the beach.,

The apartment was in a great location and within walking distance to the redline train. I only had 1 suitcase, but did struggle a little getting it up the 2 flights of stairs. Nigel & Eva were not at the apartment when I arrived, instead I was greeted by their Non English speaking mother. When I did meet them, they were both lovely and happy to answer any questions I had. They also recommended a few restaurants for me to try."

It was an easy walk from the Red line, they provided clear entry instructions, and it was also great walking distance from where I needed to be while staying there, and along the beach as well.  Nigel and Eva were both welcoming and available, the room and bathroom were both very clean and tidy with nice linens.    Thank you Nigel and Eva..."

6088708,67555391,2016-03-30,60392907,Dyona,"Staying at Jonathan's place was a great experience! He was helpful and quick in responding to any messages so I definitely suggest contacting him beforehand if you need anything. The room is exactly like the photo, very comfortable, clean with a convenient location. I was in town for a professional conference and didn't ask beforehand whether there would be an iron in the room. Luckily there was an iron right under the bathroom sink to save the day! The room is located close to a traffic circle and during the daytime you can hear the traffic pretty loudly but once that calms down the neighborhood is not too bad. In the rest of the apartment it appears that someone is living there, but during my stay I didn't see or hear anyone else inside of the apartment so I'm not sure about that."
6088708,67970579,2016-04-01,40139984,Carol,We thought the listing was accurate. It was in a great location and Boston was terrific. The place was very clean and the bed was super comfy. Bathroom was also really nice. We enjoyed our stay and Jonathan responded to any requests we had.

The bathroom also had body wash and a hairdryer which was useful. There is no closet or dresser drawers but there is a coatrack with hangers as well as a hook on the back of the door which was perfect for a short stay. It was a cold spring night and the room was kept at a good temperature."

My boyfriend and I did not actually meet Jonathan in person,but we did meet his roommate Ben who was very nice and accommodating.  The room and private bathroom were a good size for two people,but cozy.  Check-in was very easy due to the detailed instructions that Jonathan gave us - we had no issue coming or going from the Airbnb.,,,
As you might expect with older houses,the floors do creak a bit when walking and the walls are rather thin.  Ben and Jonathan however are very courteous about noise and did not keep late hours during our stay.  The shower had good water pressure and plenty of hot water.,,,,
Overall,"this was a nice Airbnb and I would recommend it to others who are looking to visit Boston.\"",,,,

La sistemazione è al primo piano di una casa indipendente, parquet a terra, cucina accessoriata di tutto, un piccolo salotto con la TV e la terrazza. La mia stanza aveva il bagno privato, molto gradito. L'appartamento è pulito e silenzioso, Jon abita al piano di sotto ed è veloce a rispondere. Unico problema se avete un auto, la zona non ha parcheggi disponibili per i visitatori ma ce ne sono molti nei pressi dell'associazione dei metalmeccanici."

We absolutely loved the location and arrangements - having our own room and bathroom. It was very easy to get on the subway just a few blocks away to travel downtown and to the convention center. Additionally, a beach is located just a short walk away for spending time by the water and renting kayaks. The apartment was very clean and offered an accessible kitchen and living room with TV. Apartment was modernized and beautiful. Thank you for being such a gracious, accommodating host and allowing us to stay! We hope to be back soon!"

Lots of great touches like the snacks waiting for us on the kitchen counter.  Lovely fireplace.  The location in the South End can't be beat--only a 10 minute walk from the T.  And Ed is an incredibly gracious host who showed us the upstairs units, which will be amazing AirBnB units once they're finished.  I highly recommend the studio for a single or couple looking for a comfortable, affordable place to stay in the South End."
322593,4079872,2013-04-08,5398283,John Ross,"This was a very pleasant few days. I was very busy and needed to work every morning and evening, for which the apartment was perfect, being peaceful and relaxing with a variety of tables/desks/chairs to work at. There was fast broadband that allowed me to work online continually with my conference team."
The apartment is close to the main conference centers,where the hotel accommodation is not at all inspiring. It would be great to go back with he family sometime,as Ed will have more rooms to let by then.,,,
"Aer Lingus was great also. \"",,,,,
322593,4127193,2013-04-12,5041015,Daniela,"We had a great time in Boston! Ed's place was great, really close to T and bus stations and walking distance to central places in Boston. The neighborhood is silent and nice. The studio was clean and ideal for a couple or a single person for either long or short stays, you will find everything you need. We were in Boston for work and the place worked perfect for us who needed space for work purposes. Ed is wonderful!! friendly, kind, helpful and approachable at any time. I would definitely recommend this apartment. We will definitely stay again when we return to Boston!"
322593,4204135,2013-04-18,5341340,Daniel,"My girlfriend, Liz, and I came to Boston for the first time because I was competing in the 2013 Boston Marathon.  Neither of us knew what to expect from the city when we arrived on that wet, chilly Friday afternoon.  The minute Ed introduced himself and showed us the comfortable, cozy, homelike apartment we'd be staying the next five days, our heads and hearts were at ease.  His apartment was within walking distance or just a couple stops on the T from everything you could possibly want to see as a tourist.  Ed was the perfect host.  He shared with us what we could see, where we could eat, and how to get to where we wanted to go."
The day of the marathon,we luckily made it back to the apartment before the bombs went off.  Ed was very concerned for our well-being.  When he saw us standing on the sidewalk talking to our friends and family I saw the sense of relief come over his face.  Ed reassured us that we were safe and out of harms way.  He even went as far as to make reservations at a great restaurant for Liz and I so we could get our minds off what had happened earlier that afternoon.,,,,
The day we left both Liz and I had a chance to really get to talk to Ed. We realized he was not just the perfect host and great conversationalist,but a friend. We cannot thank him enough for hospitality for making our first time to Boston the trip of a lifetime.  We look forward to exchanged emails,(SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) messages,and seeing him again (hopefully) next year.,,

The house is in a fantastic neighborhood full of charme and is walikg distance from city center and few dollars of taxi from harbour and Quincy market. The house is great with everything needed, good grocery shop nearby and the new part that Ed is building will be amazing. I'm waiting the pics Ed! And we'll be back for sure"

322593,4417253,2013-05-04,4247022,Tiago,Tremendous location and a very kind and attentive host. Ideal proposition for a short stay in Boston with maximum city enjoyment.
322593,4504805,2013-05-09,4007737,Tom,Ed is just a wonderful host. He was very helpful in every way: he really made a huge effort trying to make the new router of the wifi work + he always had helpful advice with restaurants and other hot spots of the city. We spent three nights at One-Five-eight and enjoyed every moment of it.
The neighborhood is so beautiful and clean with all the brownstone houses. Many great restaurants available by foot within minutes. The city center is also close and easily accessible by foot or public transport.,,,,,
The ground floor apartment is very spacious with a very well equiped kitchen. All facilities are very functional just the way one would want them to be. However,we had the chance to see Ed's project in the top floors of the building: these are even more spectacular! Ed is building his dream and if you have an opportunity to stay in the first floor or penthouse we would recommend this even more.  In any case you can be sure that staying with Ed has been such a positive experience that we would highly recommend this to anybody. If we ever return to Boston we will surely try to stay with Ed again.,,,,
"Thank you very much again! Marlene & Tom\"",,,,,
322593,4660227,2013-05-19,5382716,Kushal,"Edward is an amazing host right from meeting me on the steps outside after my distressed call because the taxi had taken me to the wrong address. to recommending restaurants up to my last mea in Boston. The apartment is amazing and very well stocked with cereals, milk,peanut butter enough crockery and cutlery. More than enough fresh towels, as well as some toiletries. It is spacious for a studio, with sufficient light coming in. The only two issues I had during my stay were the small spiral staircase which is a pain for luggage and the sounds of construction (which will soon be done). If you are planning to spend the day outside the sounds are not a problem anyway. Neither is the staircase because i used it with luggage only on my first and last day."
The apartment was within short walking distance of a lot of restaurants Tremont street and malls like Prodential center and Copley place are only slightly further away. The feel of the neighborhood is overall pleasant and very safe. Edward was always a phone call or text away to fix any of the minor issues. It felt more like a bed and breakfast than a vacation rental. All the appliances in the kitchen,tv,and Internet work perfectly. The Internet speeds were amazing!,,,
"I highly recommend this apartment and Edward to any one considering a visit to Boston.\"",,,,,
322593,4728080,2013-05-22,3916222,Marshka,"Edward’s apartment was a perfect base for our weekend in Boston.  We were pleasantly surprised at how spacious the apartment was compared to the photos and it is very well equipped with everything we needed for our stay.  Edward had even stocked the kitchen and fridge with fruit, juice and snacks.  The building is beautiful and Edward also rents the apartments above - they are spectacular. The location was on a lovely quiet street in South End, only steps away from Restaurant Row.  We were able to walk everywhere – including Boston Common, downtown, Beacon Hill and Back Bay.  For those who don’t like walking as much the MBTA subway stop is 10 minutes walk away.  Edward was easy to reach by email and phone and was there to greet us at the apartment. He was a great host and we’d recommend the apartment as a nice base for exploring Boston."
322593,4775079,2013-05-25,5213310,Jing,The room is amazing!!! The host Ed is so nice!!! The neighborhood is quiet. We spent a wonderful time there. And the host is planing to post other rooms. Looking forward to staying there again!!
322593,4859286,2013-05-29,5642323,Jody,"This being my first experience with AirBnB, I was slightly apprehensive but knew I was in great hands before I even landed in Boston. Edward answered all my questions promptly and with great detail."
He was a lovely host and I would HIGHLY recommend his accommodation. Jeff and I commented many times about how we must come back and stay with Edward again. He left maps,gave wonderful restaurant recommendations and was a wealth of information about the neighbourhood and city.,,,,
His space was fabulous! Exposed brick walls,mirrors galore - couples will not fight for a bathroom mirror :),a cute little (electric) fireplace,a state of the art kitchen and a cozy back garden where we enjoyed our breakfast for three lovely mornings. Our arrival day was complete with champagne,cheese and French bread out back in the sun - simply lovely.,
He's also just built a fabulous new space upstairs. And,yes,there is actually a tree house.,,,
"I could go on forever. Just stay here.\"",,,,,
322593,4962959,2013-06-04,5612685,Robert,"My wife, 9 month old daughter, and I went to Boston via rail and wanted to find somewhere that we could walk to or take public transportation to all of the sights/food/necessities because we didn't want to have to bring a carseat.  I have to say - this was our first experience with airbnb and we were hesitant - but Ed's studio apartment (and Ed!) was much more than we could have asked for.  It's in a great location near food, the Back Bay rail station (we took Amtrak to Boston), the T, trolley stops, and that's only the beginning."
The apartment itself was great - Ed gave us a small stock of necessities in the kitchen,a map to nearby places to eat or shop at,and a grand tour of the apartment and where everything was as soon as we checked in.  The apartment was spectacularly clean,modern,and well cared for - and having access to a full refrigerator/freezer,stove
On top of all of that,Ed acted as an excellent guide to places to see or eat at,helped getting our bags in,and was just an all around great host.  He was always available to help with recommendations (including letting us know before we got there that we should get off the train early instead of doubling back via the T),get us additional towels when we ran out due to having a 9 month old with us,or to chat and tell us about the building we were staying in - including a tour of the penthouse unit!  We really can't say enough good things about Ed.
Additionally,our time in Boston was fantastic.  I'm not sure what we really expected,but the people of Boston were some of the nicest people we've encountered - from walking up and down Tremont street to riding the Trolley around town,to exploring on foot.  We even had a Trolley driver volunteer to take us from the Harbor back to our stop after hours (we stayed at the USS Constitution longer than expected).  After arriving back from the Navy Yard 20 minutes after the last planned Old Town Trolley departure of the day,we noticed there was one loaded up at the stop.  We asked the driver if it was going where we needed to,and he responded no
322593,5002534,2013-06-06,6681211,Janet,"This was our first time staying in Boston's South End, and we absolutely loved it!! What a find - the studio apartment was FABULOUS!!  It was very private, modern, well-stocked and super clean. Loved the exposed brick walls!! This space was so amazing and Ed was such a wonderful host, I almost hate to write such a glowing recommendation - I want to keep it all to ourselves :) The street was quaint and quiet, the back patio a perfect spot for breakfast or a late afternoon glass of wine. We will definitely be back for more!! Thanks Ed -"
322593,5052879,2013-06-10,5851377,Mario,"The stay in Boston was particularly pleasant thanks to Edward, in fact, is ready to give all possible assistance for travel and for everything you might need. The apartment is very nice and well furnished, the area is simply gorgeous, quiet and 5 minutes walk from the center. I had the chance to view the apartment on the upper floor, and is undoubtedly spectacular ... the next time I'm in Boston I can not miss, I recommend it to everyone!"

322593,5393689,2013-06-28,4716084,April,This review is going to similar to the others because I have no complaints. It is a wonderful brownstone hosted by a wonderful man.
The place is ideally located and just a brief walk from the center of Boston and the metro to get around. It is also nice,clean,and modern. It was perfectly comfortable during our stay in Boston looking at colleges.,,,
I also can not say enough positive about Ed. He was the ideal host and very thoughtful and knowledgeable about the city and where to go. He's a great person to sit and chat with,as we did our first night,over tea.,,,
I'm not sure the next time that I will be back in Boston,but when I do,"I'll make a sure to stay back there..\"",,,
322593,5555222,2013-07-06,5381523,Nerissa,"\"This was my first experience with Airbnb and with the accommodations and the host I got, I highly recommend it.  Ed was very easy to communicate with, friendly, and always ready to help.  His place was clean, spacious, and well equipped.  I had everything I needed to be comfortable, plus extra.  The studio was perfectly located, with two T stations within 5-6 blocks and a bus stop one block away (though with the T, who wants to take the bus?), but the only time I took public transportation was to/from the airport.  Ed's place is in the northern section of South End, only a couple of blocks from Back Bay and within walking distance of the city's center.  Shopping, restaurants, tourist attractions, grocery store, and even gyms are within one's fingertips, yet the studio feels far removed because it's in a quiet residential area with streets that are lined with beautiful, mature trees.  The best way to really see a comfortably-sized city like Boston is by walking, and that's what I did.  I walked everywhere from my front door: to Fenway Park, to Charlestown (for the U.S.S. Constitution), to Cambridge, even to the JFK Library (the latter you should do only if you're a real walker since it's five miles one way).  This was my first visit to Boston, and as I told a Bostonian after five days there, \"\"I see no reason why I would ever want to visit New York again.\"\"  The city is charming"
322593,5785365,2013-07-16,3099607,Hardeep,"Good location, safe neighborhood and close to amenities.  The accommodation was clean and luxurious. We had a  lovely time in Boston and loved the fact we had our own studio as opposed to hotel room."
322593,5816786,2013-07-17,6597888,Judah,"Cozy, welcoming apartment with a great host!"
I stayed with Ed recently at his brownstone in Boston’s historic South End. Ed has several units for rent – all beautiful and recently redone. I stayed in the ground floor studio,which has a private entrance in back,and also has a sweet patio/mini garden perfect for eating outdoors,reading,etc. Inside,the studio has an open floor-plan and feels spacious
I highly recommend Ed’s place if you want to be in a quiet,comfortable space close to the action!,,,,

322593,5856205,2013-07-19,7471622,Stephen,"Edward truly loves being an airbnb host.  He was very communicative and helpful.  He loves Boston and is very knowledgeable regarding things to do and how to get around. This was our first experience using airbnb and was our first visit to Boston.  We had actually reserved the Studio but due to a scheduling glitch it was not available.  Edward graciously helped us arrange alternate accommodations in the penthouse which he is working on completing and making available in the near future.  The penthouse has two bedrooms on the uppermost level of the same building as the Studio. The bedroom we were provided had its own private bath.  All construction is new and very well done.  Exposed brick walls, track lighting, new windows, hardwood floors, very high quality bathroom fixtures, etc.   The bedrooms overlook the living area one level below with a great room and combination kitchen and living area that is open from the front of the unit through to the rear.  Very light and bright.  The building has a dramatic three story exterior spiral stair leading down to the parking area and alley behind."

Your knowledge of the city helped us explore the city with ease. The restaurant recommendations were top-notched. We thoroughly enjoyed The Kitchen.,,,,,

Edward was very open to us using the space for a video production.

In fact, we didn't use public transport once while we were there! The bed was super comfy, the kitchen large and spacious to cook in, and the whole studio clean, comfortable, and well-designed. Ed was a lovely host who had some great recommendations for places to eat and things to do in Boston. We would not hesitate to recommend the accommodation and Ed as a host to others looking to visit Boston.

322593,7806134,2013-10-04,5078400,Lee,Myself and my girlfriend were on a trip to Boston from Ireland and after a bit of research we decided the south end/back Bay Area would suit us best so Edwards apartment was perfect for us. 5 minute walk to all the shops and restaurant/bars you could hope for plus very easy to get around the city on the nearby T subway station.
the apartment itself is excellent,exactly as it looks in photos,very clean with everything you could possibly need including a massive tv which I was very happy with! the area is very quiet and safe so we were able to get a very good sleep which was great after the long trip from Ireland.,,,

It was clean and comfortable and quiet (apart from renovations next door but hopefully they will be over soon!). The street where the apartment is located is very attractive and it is a great neighbourhood to be in - it feels safe, it's quiet but there are lots of restaurants nearby.  The apartment is close to everything and you can walk to wherever you want to be in central Boston.  Only minor drawback is getting big suitcases down the very narrow spiral staircase."
322593,8185571,2013-10-20,4687370,Dean,"Great experience living in Boston in a charming apartment in a wonderful little south end neighborhood!  The apartment was impeccable with all the special little touches that made it feel like a home away from home.  I loved the little winding staircase to get to the flat - my only concern being that someone who is overweight might not be able to navigate it.  Not a single complaint and I would stay there - change that - I would move there - in a minute.  Having lived a suburban lifestyle my entire life, currently in Minnesota, this was comfortable and stylish urban living."
The neighborhood was outstanding,being just a few steps from Tremont street,where there are many shops,"restaurants and a few pubs.  I attended a conference downtown but convinced my friends to meet me at \"\"my place\"\" before heading to one of \"\"my\"\" neighborhood restaurants",which all had the right combination of atmosphere and great food.  Three nights in a row going a block further each time,different friends each night were jealous of Tremont 647
Each night,after hailing a taxi and sending my friends off to their downtown hotels,I'd slip into my favorite local pub to end the evening with a pint of some local dark brew and a little live jazz at the Beehive.  All of this in my own backyard :),,,
While public transit is awesome in Beantown,I think Ed should change the title of his place to StudioPatioPond+BikeToBoston.  Hubway,the bikeshare program in Boston,paired with the app Spotcycle,got me to and from the convention center and downtown in record time.  Possibly the highlight of the trip - though it has a lot of competition!,
Thanks for a great experience,"Ed and airbnb!\"",,,,
322593,8292698,2013-10-24,3908877,John,Ed is awesome. He was a great host. His communication was prompt and informative. The studio was really cool and the location could not have been *any* better for a long weekend in Boston. We made the use of the T and buses and our feet to get everywhere. Ed was all-around so helpful. I'd easily choose him as a host again and would recommend him to anyone.

The bottom apartment is spacious, tranquil, and private. The bed is comfortable and cozy, and the linens were new and soft. The kitchen was fully stocked with accessories and cooking necessities--Ed even left us fresh kiwis, oranges, apples, and pears! Each morning, I sipped my coffee out in the lovely porch in the back which was noiseless, clean, and lined with lovely fall plants. We were literally a few homes down from a very posh street lined with lovely cafes, restaurants, and boutiques, a Starbucks on the next block, and the theater district about half a mile away. Easy access for walking the beautiful Freedom Trail in the city of Boston!  I highly suggest this lovely apartment. The next time I am in Boston, I will surely stay here!"

I rented the studio for a week, and it worked out very well. The location is excellent, one of the best in Boston: close to Tremont St. with all the restaurants and bars, and just a 5-10 minute walk to the Prudential / Sheraton / Hynes convention (and thus Back Bay). There's a narrow staircase taking down to the studio, which is just under the ground level facing a small parking lot. The place is overall quiet, apart from some road work I could hear in the morning out on W Brookline st. Excellent internet connection, spacious, warm, and clean place, had all the equipment needed to cook a meal and store food. Bathroom was also clean and functional. Also, there's a huge TV which I used only once. The place is ideal for a business traveler or for a young couple visiting Boston. Overall great value and highly recommended!"

322593,9591879,2014-01-03,9459982,Karina,My husband and I stayed in Ed's Studio in Boston and got a wonderful surprise when we descended the stairs into the apartment. It was really lovely. Everything you would need - fully decked out kitchen although we mainly ate out at all the wonderful restaurants and cafes within walking distance. The apartment was surprisingly spacious although as the name suggests - it is a studio - 1 large room. The massive TV was also a nice surprise as was the cable and internet connection and the cord that allowed us to plug our macbook straight into the TV.
Bed was comfortable and the apartment was very clean and quiet - a nice 'hotel feel'.,,,,,
The location of the apartment was great also. We had never been to Boston before and realised when we arrived we had quite luckily landed ourselves in a great location. We walked into town some days and other days we went via subway.,,,,,
We didn't end up meeting Ed however,was in continual contact with him up to and during our stay via messaging.,,,,
"Would definitely recommend this apartment for a single or a couple visiting Boston. Thanks Ed.  \"",,,,,
322593,9781529,2014-01-09,290395,Daniel,Edward was a considerate host. We had a great time! The South End is an amazing location.

322593,9985382,2014-01-23,3559418,Garry,"My wife, Jan and I stayed in Ed's place for nearly two weeks.  We had a fantastic time in Boston and the studio was exactly what we wanted.  It is in a perfect location in the Southend, close to the T, no.1 and no. 43 buses and you can be in Park Street within 15 minutes.  The locality had great shops, take-outs and restaurants.  The studio itself was excellent, we had a perfect amount of space, a nice fire we could turn on when it was very cold outside and a huge TV area where we could sit, relax and watch netflix.  The kitchen was ideal and has everything you need, and the bathroom is small but very functional.  All in all, I would highly recommend Ed's place.  He also gave us a tour of the other rooms/duplex available and they are also great! We look forward to staying again and I would highly recommend it.  Finally Ed responded within minutes to any requests we had throughout our stay.  A great host."
322593,10242388,2014-02-09,3223043,James & Angie,"Ed was such a fantastic host - very welcoming, friendly and hospitable! On our first day in Boston, there was a snow storm and Ed kindly left a puzzle and some DVDs at our door to keep us entertained. He also showed us around his beautiful and newly refurbished apartments; one of which will be open soon to rent on AirBnb!"
The studio we stayed in was on the basement floor of the building. It is very cosy and comfortable,and has a newly redone bathroom. The extra large TV and the generous closest spaces were particularly nice. There is a coin laundry located on the floor above.,,,,
The studio is also in a lovely location. It is very close to restaurants,and a short walk away from the grocery store and Back Bay train station.,,,,
We had a great time in Boston,"thank you Ed! \"",,,,
322593,10469336,2014-02-20,10642495,Yasmin,"Ed was a wonderful host and did everything to make me feel as comfortable as possible during my time in Boston. I wasn't aware that the studio didn't have as much lighting as I would have liked, nor was I aware of how tiny the bathroom was, which is why I rate this a 4 out of 5 stars. Otherwise, everything else was most enjoyable. Wonderful location near so many great restaurants and literally a 10 to 15 minute walk to the Pru. Thank you for having me Ed!"
322593,11289640,2014-03-28,1491207,Nicole,"I had a great stay at Edward's place. It's lovely and located in great area, with shops and restaurants at your doorstep. I found it extremely easy to get around, being close to public transport. Ed was a very kind host, and communication was always easy. He kindly gave me a tour of the other flats in the house, which were equally as beautiful. I look forward to my next trip to Boston! Thanks Ed."
322593,11405065,2014-04-01,12555301,Mindy,My daughter and I just returned from a long weekend in Boston. It was our first trip there - we both live in Houston. We had a wonderful time. Ed was a great host and made our stay pleasant and very memorable. The location was perfect- south end but within walking distance to most everywhere. We explored an amazing number of  sites and will definitely be back with family to stay in the penthouse next time. The only negative for this location was the narrow steep spiral staircase leading  down to our apt  but Ed took care to help us with our bags so it wasn't a problem. Also i would recommend getting tickets ahead of time to the symphony as even in the off season we could not get a seat. The trolly tours and subways are  great but i would recommend a cab  from airport - cost was under $30 including tip and the drivers were great. Everyone in Boston was friendly and helpful. So if your considering a trip I encourage you to go- you'll have a great time.
322593,11713316,2014-04-13,12613338,Jon,"Thank you Edward, a delightful studio apartment that is so close to everything, and we just loved the neighborhood. We were definitely most comfortable during our 4 night stay, and would highly recommend your place. Good Luck with the roof deck and renovation of the back area, this will truly add more value to your already wonderful place."
322593,12231141,2014-04-27,3857195,Lynn,"We had a great time in the city of Boston, so much history, great restaurants, museums and transport."
We liked the location of the house; it’s a great location for getting around the city,walking,train,and bus,lots of local cafés and restaurants.,
However,it’s currently a construction site,constant noise from early morning and the patio is not usable at this time.,,,
The studio is well appointed,nice kitchen and facilities. The TV is only blue ray not local programs.,,,,
Most of the night we heard noises,we think from the furnace and pipes,earplugs are recommended.,,,
As its in the basement,It did feel a bit like being in the dungeon,lots of cob webs,and the curtains on the back wall are covered in dust along with the shelves,overall a bit of a dark place. The metal spiral staircase is very difficult to navigate especially with a large suitcase,narrow and steep
However Ed,our host was excellent,always went out of his way to help and very knowledgeable about the area.,,,
We would definitely go back to Boston :),,,,,
and would stay with ED once the construction is finished.,,,,,

322593,13248650,2014-05-23,622867,Bonnie,Edward was very helpful and responded to any questions that I had within hours. The studio looked exactly as what shown in the pictures - I love the lightening! It was a great experience! Thanks : ) !
322593,13401170,2014-05-27,11559057,Mark,"We spent the Memorial day weekend here. Exactly as advertised...but better. Clean as a whistle, comfortable, great location, and very livable. Host was accessible and accommodating. Will definitely stay at location again."
322593,13560058,2014-05-31,7248591,Morgan,"We had a great stay here at the end of May! The studio space is very unique and comfortable to rest and get some work done if need be. Ed was an excellent host and made access incredibly easy. We never got the chance to meet him personally but he was very accessible via phone to answer any questions. Studio was very quiet except for early mornings when tenants on upper levels are moving around - which is to be expected. Was not an issue for us. Location was our favorite part of our stay! We were just blocks from coffee shops and awesome restaurants to choose from. Everything about the stay was what we were hoping it would be. Thanks for everything, Ed! Hope we get to see you on the next trip!"
322593,13784263,2014-06-04,13646730,Sharyn & Rob,"Our stay at Edward's Studio walkout terrance was brilliant and Ed was an excellent host.  We were made very comfortable and welcomed upon landing in Boston as travellers from Australia.  We strongly recommend staying at Ed's studio as it is central to everything and close to restaurants.  The studio was clean, self contained and the bed was comfortable.  The check in and check out process was easy."
322593,13898199,2014-06-07,7133730,Neil,"Ed was a great host, very attentive to any needs or questions.  The place is great and so is the neighborhood.  I'd recommend staying here."
322593,13943148,2014-06-09,10736663,Jane,"This unit is contiguous to a 2 BR/2B unit just above it.  We rented both units for a family trip for a wedding weekend.  The combination of spaces worked perfectly for 3 adult couples and the convenience of the adjacent space was helpful.  We could share breakfast together, easily connect for transportation, etc.  Our host Ed could not have been more attentive and accommodating.  The units were immaculate, tasteful, and well equipped.  We had such a great experience with this rental - our first with Airbnb."
322593,14163488,2014-06-13,15913463,Nin,"Ed was a very accommodating and patient host.  And very prompt with requests/questions/inquiries/help.  I had no issues during my stay.  I had plenty of privacy in the basement studio which I booked.  Ed has done a very artsy job with the space he had.  Also the surrounding area is really cute, you are right in south end and close to green and orange metro stops.  Tons of fun things to do."
One thing to note is that the staircase down to the basement is narrow,and can be tricky for bulky baggage,but if you travel light you should be good.  Otherwise,the walkout terrace/back entrance solves that issue.  If you plan to stay in the studio a lot,you may also want to note that there is some renovation work going on.. But Ed works around your schedule,and I never had any overlap with my schedule.
Thanks for a comfortable stay Ed. And for the recommendations.,,,,,

322593,14266333,2014-06-16,2607580,Aaron,"Edwards studio was the perfect place to stay for our long weekend in Boston. It was exactly as pictured.. Very clean as well! It was in a perfect location for just about everything we did in the city and on a very nice and quiet street. Edward was a great host, very nice and accommodating. Luckily he even had umbrellas for us in the lobby for us to use! I would definitely recommend Edward and his apartment to anybody traveling to Boston! Cant wait to plan my next trip to Boston! Thanks again Edward!"
322593,14453208,2014-06-19,16667063,Kelly,Edward was a great host. I loved the place and the location in the city was perfect!
322593,14987877,2014-06-30,1600908,Lindsay,Ed deserves all his great reviews as they are well earned. Ed gave us good advice on our trip and was a generous host.
322593,15183476,2014-07-04,9542140,Weston,"This was my first trip to Boston, as well as my first time using Airbnb, and my best friend and I couldn't have asked for a better host or a better place to stay. Ed's place was perfect. The neighborhood was quiet and safe and in the perfect location. There were some really cool bars and restaurants nearby and Ed even suggested a few golf courses for us to try since we mentioned that golfing was something we were planning to do. Everything we needed was easily accessible from his place! Fenway Park was only about a mile away, which was great for us since we went to two Red Sox games. Also, just a quick drive, or even a quick walk, to some convenient stores around the corner, which came in handy."
"I was lucky enough to meet Ed and he even showed me the great view he has of Boston from the rooftop of his building. I would most definitely recommend staying here if you're going to be in Boston. I really can't stress enough how helpful he was before and during our trip. Staying at Ed's made my first experience of Boston and Airbnb truly fantastic! Thank you Ed!!\"",,,,,
322593,16001667,2014-07-20,429917,Urs,"We were very happy in Ed's studio. It offered everything we needed and was close to all the attractions we wanted to see. Ed was a great host. He answered all our questions quickly. When we could not access the internet with our iPhones, he organized a better, stronger WiFi. The studio is in the basement and has a narrow staircase leading down to it, which may be a problem for some but was ok for us. We would sure come and stay at his place anytime again."
322593,16242808,2014-07-24,497864,Doreen,Ed is a pleasant host. In advance of our stay at his studio he gave us many informations about Boston and the accommodation. The studio is awesome ans we had a very nice time there. We can highly recommend Ed and his studio.
322593,16776410,2014-08-02,5765979,Elif Damla,"This is our second time at Ed's wonderful house. Briefly, our stay with my son, 7 years old, was excellent. Studio provides a warm house atmosphere fulfill with all amenities that never can be found at hotel. The location is excellent. Neighboorhood is secure and Ed is always helpful. If we visit again Boston, our choice will be same."
322593,16879049,2014-08-03,14701583,Nate,"This was a great stay and I would recommend it. Very clean and organized, and Edward is great."
322593,17098992,2014-08-07,2771987,Dorothy,"Ed was a lovely host, and the neighborhood and location are exactly where we wanted to be! We love the South End."
The studio is just as pictured--recently redone and nicely outfitted. What does not show up in the picture is the smell of mildew apparent in many basements. Ed has some high quality dehumidifiers that we were apparently supposed to keep running 100% of the time (even when not there,we later learned). Since we did not do that,the apartment felt (and smelt) like a damp basement apartment--and,not surprisingly,has a problems with bugs. During the time we were there we saw 2 huge roaches. When a roach ran across my pillow one night I knew I could no longer sleep there.,
Ed was super nice about the whole thing,and even tried to accommodate us in his lovely apartment upstairs. In the end,though,we checked out a night early and he refunded us our money for that evening. Our last evening in Boston ended up costing us $400 for a last-minute hotel room in Back Bay...frankly,I am a bit reluctant to use Airbnb again despite many positive experiences before this rental.,
Again,Ed was lovely about the whole thing,"and I am sure has many other apartments available in the building to offer his guests that would be ideal. His place is definitely nice! I simply would not recommend the basement studio (unless you're ok with bugs).\"",,,
322593,17672046,2014-08-16,8548197,Vicci,"Great neighborhood, lots of good suggestions from Edward for fun stuff.  Easy walk to everything.  Loved the studio, large, clean, organized and there is now a huge TV.  Appreciated that we were allowed to check in prior to 3PM as we had taken the 'red eye' from CA.  There was even coffee, some jam, and other basics that made making toast and breakfast easy.  Just don't bring a large suitcase, the stairway really is narrow."
322593,17921920,2014-08-19,9971444,Paul,"I didn't meet Edward personally, but he was very easy to communicate with (via AirBnb and texting), and informative of the local area."
The basement level apartment was as shown in the photos. It's in a great location – and only 25/30mins from Logan airport.,,,,,
Edward states this is right on the bus route,which it is,but it's only a short walk to the 'T' (equivalent of the London Underground),as well as two shopping malls,and Newbury Street shops. As Boston isn't overly large,this transport access means you can cover the city with ease. Saying that
The apartment was clean and tidy when I arrived,and a comfortable place to rest after a long day waling around town. It's also a very secure place - there's three doors to get through before you can entrée the apartment!,,,,
Minor quibbles: Being a basement apartment meant that noise can be heard from the apartment above (footsteps,laughter),and the slim stair-well will be problematic for those of a larger size – but there is a rear-entrance available!,,,
Overall,"I'd recommend this place for a short-stay as I did (3 nights as part of a tour of the USA). \"",,,,

1) Inside the appartament it's easy to hear steps by other persons who live upstairs. However,for us it was not a problem.,,,,
2) cleaning was correct,but not perfect. Perhaps,our cleaning standard is very high,but we think there was small details like fridge or dust on furniture that could be better...our oppinion is that there are too many unneeded things inside the flat.,,

I was relatively comfortable in the Studio WalkOut Terrace,once I got used to staying there.  I wasn't feeling very well after surgery,and in retrospect,probably should have had a friend/SO staying with me.  The Studio is plenty large enough,with all the facilities one could ask for.  However,it is a basement apt.
On the plus side,Edward checked in on me periodically by phone/text,which was great,and he was quick to respond whenever I needed anything at all.  Having access to the outside patio via the back door was nice as well,even if just to step outside briefly for some air or to use my cell phone. The bathroom is small but very adequate,with a shower stall.
I would recommend the Studio WalkOut Terrace apt. to any couple that's visiting Boston/The South End for pleasure.  It's private (separate entrance) and convenient with all the amenities,"and Edward is a great host.  \"",,,,

322593,22423376,2014-11-06,13105662,Julio,"We were going to a medicalcongress and decided to use Airbnb as we are doing frequently. After some messages ,always with prolixanswers, we decided to rent. We needed the apartment for 7days but it was available only for 5days. Edward offered us the penthouse for 2days and promised to help us with our luggage because there were a lot of stairs from 1to other. Believing in it we had rent the penthouse. The bad things started when we arrived. The parking that wehad rent and paid separated was, a real swamp, and after a raining day , we had to walk among the mud until the backdoor. I had to walk untill the frontdoor, one square of mud to open that. The studio, was a basement, dark, dusty and smelling bad. If you see it at the website andsee it alive you will believe in photoshop. There were scary statues at the wall and a lot of old food atthe freezer. We found also a bag with some dirt clothes into the wardrobe. We expected somebody there to showus how to use the things into the apartment, where we could find brooms, vacuumcleaner and things to clean the place but nobody appeared. The dishes were dusty and the blackcarpet was dirty. The towels lookslike sandpapers. We cleaned the things and as we didn't have toomuch time, we decided to stay. The second day the wi-fi didn't work and we texted Edward and he told us that his wi-fi was workinggood and that he tryed to fix ours. We stayed more than 24hours without connection. Instead of invite us to go to the penthouse to use it, he suggested us togoto Starbucks. The first time that we met him we expect something like, good afternoon or a welcome, but he was talking with his cellphone and didn't talked nothing tous. Later he knocked our door andagain just said tous that he was trying to fix the wi-fi. Changing the rooms we combine at 9 A.M. and nobody,Edward or his employees appeared. We had to carry all our luggage for a lot of stairs, very narrow, alone. We left all our luggage under the stairs, with no safe and went to our congress. Around 4 P.M. we returned, and we were invited to take our shoes off and we had to walk on a , not too clean, ground. Edward was washing 2 hand towels that he said that we left into his studio, dirt, and said that we left the studio messy. What about the clean tax? I said him that I had some complains and he answered me: You have to leave this house right now ! That time we had to look in a hurry for some available room in Boston, took our luggage and went out. If you are lookin for a good place , with somebody gentle and helpful, forget Edward, basement (called studio), penthouse and his swamp (called parking). We never had been outraged like that."
322593,23077718,2014-11-22,2001292,Miriam,"Edward's apartment is a great place to stay in Boston. The location is fantastic -- it's an easy walk to great sites, restaurants, shops, etc.. The apartment itself is a great value as it is priced much lower than the average hotel in Boston. It is a basement apartment and so felt pretty dark, especially because we were there in winter. There are some quirks about the place -- the light switches are all over the place, the bed is on a slight slope. Also, the Internet was not working while we were there. Ed responded very quickly and was very friendly, even if he wasn't able to help right away."

322593,23837090,2014-12-12,21169019,Lacey,Overall a great stay!
Edward was very responsive while booking and planning visit. The internet was not working at first and he took every step to get it fixed in a timely manner. There was some confusion about check out date,but after double checking his records,it was resolved.,,,
"Note to travelers with large suitcases!! The spiral staircase leading down to the room is quite narrow and the back door may be easier to use.\"",,,,,
322593,24101179,2014-12-20,20463317,Ranjith,"Fantastic apartment, fantastic location, fantastic host. Apartment was as described and had a very homely feel! Staircase down to the lower level is a bit of a squeeze but you get used to it. Ed was lovely and very helpful."
322593,24210353,2014-12-22,179620,Hunter,Wonderful place. Perfect location. Host is very attentive. Would absolutely stay again. Place is beautiful inside with a HUGE tv.

322593,27302406,2015-03-01,28260535,Yang,super nice host! super nice dining in Boston. This location is amazing also. Edward is very very nice and kind.
322593,27502508,2015-03-06,16761385,Olivier,"Great, clean, central studio in the beautiful South End.  The studio was perfect for me, who was coming for meetings to Boston (very central and easy access to public transit) yet wanted a nice place to come back to at the end of the day.  Of note, the studio has light coming mostly from the back end as it is located in a basement, but lighting, even in the grim of February was enough.  Ed was a present but discrete host, who was very rapid to respond to any questions or comments."
322593,27609645,2015-03-08,20364161,Nelson,"Ed did a great job of welcoming us to Boston. We flew in extremely late on a Friday night and we were grateful for such a great stay in an amazing location! The temps were below freezing outside, but the room was nice and toasty because Ed had the heater on for us!  I wish we could have stayed there longer!"
322593,29493534,2015-04-08,8716024,Jack,Great experience as usual. We love being so close all the best restaurants.

322593,29769864,2015-04-12,1524936,Joshua,"Edward was a perfect host.  He provided very precise information for gaining access to the studio and checked in numerous times throughout the stay to make sure everything was going alright.  He even went out of his way to introduce himself in person and when I left a pair of shirts on hangers in the closet, he was kind enough to grab them for me and meet me that afternoon to come pick them up."
322593,30373417,2015-04-21,19628732,Mark,A fantastic studio in an incredible location - right in the heart of all things South End Boston including some truly terrific restaurants.
Only a short stroll to downtown and for me to the Boston marathon buses.,,,,,
"Loved the studio inclusive of some nice and clear instructions for getting in and out. Loved being able to put the feet up after the race with a glass of wine in such a roomy space complete with comfy couch - a way better experience than getting a hotel! Cheers Edward...\"",,,,,

322593,31506629,2015-05-06,26324170,Caroline,"We booked with Ed after a recommendation from a friend and the the accommodation was great, living up to our expectations. The studio was clean and spacious with everything we needed for our week long stay. Within easy walking distance from the subway network, even with luggage. Ed met us when we arrived, explained everything and gave us some tips on getting around Boston. Definitely recommend the studio for anyone looking to stay in Boston, close access to everything and a great host!!"
322593,31934589,2015-05-12,11726938,Vanessa,"Super convinient location, very close to all the brunch/dinner places at south end, also a very close walk to back bay area. The apartment was simple and nice decoration. Bed was very comfy. Ed was always here to help whenever we needed."

Again, we were happy with our experience and appreciate the hospitality!  This trip we particularly enjoyed the patio space just outside our condo - table for 4!  Because this was our second stay, we felt right at home!"

The place was marvellous and impecable. My fiancé loved everything specially the rustic view of the bed side and the modern contrast it makes with the beautiful kitchen.,,,,,
We'll love to stay again one of these days.,,,,,

The studio has a lot of style and while it is a basement,"you don't really feel it. We found it was an excellent location to visit Boston.\"",,,,
322593,33991764,2015-06-03,2771776,Janice,"We stayed at Eds studio for three days and the place was awesome!  Exactly as pictured..stocked with plenty of kitchenware if you decide to cook...

Internet connectivity was spotty,"but that was likely more an external than internal problem\"",,,,
322593,34420636,2015-06-08,10409674,Teresa,Great communication with the host before and during our stay. The photos are exactly how it is. Sweet neighborhood. The back porch was great and necessary as the basement studio can be dark. We received a descriptive email with the codes for the doors but it still took us a  few tries to get it down. Not sure if it was the mattress of the flooring but we slid down the bed a few times throughout the night. Besides that it was great and if recommend it to friends.
322593,34784465,2015-06-12,32165936,Rob,Excellent accommodations for my needs.  The apartment was exactly as described. It was clean and in a great location.  Ed was a pleasure to deal with. He answered many questions ahead of time and was very reachable. I would definitely book again.
322593,35174384,2015-06-15,5223567,Michael,"Ed is one of the best hosts I've had the pleasure of staying with since I first started using AirBnB in 2013. The studio is wonderfully decorated with all of the amenities you could ask for and a host who is willing to go the distance to make sure you have a great stay. It is in a fantastic location that is quiet enough at night, but also within walking distance to plenty of restaurants and bars. A friend and I even took a walk to the Prudential Center where duck tours were being loaded. The studio is absolutely wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone hoping to experience Boston. Thanks Ed!"
322593,35316499,2015-06-17,21070547,Oliver,"Edward gave perfect clear instructions for our whole stay, finding the place was easy. Access was as described and the place was perfect for my stay.

The location was handy to many restaurants and all amenities, with public transport close at hand. Edward kept good contact with us for any questions and a great host. Definitly come back again."
322593,38982905,2015-07-20,28325248,Christian,Lovely basement apartment in a wonderful neighbourhood. Steps from an entire street of restaurants and shops. As well about a 15 minute walk to the downtown area (Back Bay etc.). Edward was very easy to get ahold of and very responsive. Would highly recommend.
322593,40082320,2015-07-28,11455924,Leslie,The apartment was very clean and has a wonderful location. It suited our needs very well. We would definitely stay here again if we return to Boston!
322593,40574488,2015-08-01,31979874,Basil,The apartment is ideally located: It's not to far from the waterfront and it's even closer to the very good restaurants and bars.

322593,42653282,2015-08-15,950444,Lauri,"Ed is a fantastic host, and the Studio was all that we expected...a clean, comfortable, relaxing, tastefully decorated space that was a blissful home away from home. Within walking distance are several great eateries, a great health-oriented market, salons, spas, shopping and public transportation."
If you have difficulty walking,this is not for you - only because of how the space is accessed. In that case,consider the upper levels - Ed gave us a tour and they are LOVELY!,,,

He was very fast in his responses and accommodated my requests as best he could. Even though I struggled with the keypads late at night, he was available via phone. He even offered to meet me to help me with my luggage. I loved the location of the apartment, within walking distance of transportation and in between NEU and the BCEC,where I needed to be. Great stay."

The apartment was beautiful,very quiet and close to everything we needed.,,,,
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone thinking of staying in Boston.,,,,,
This was my first time using air bnb and I was a little scared but I didn't need to be as Ed was so helpful and accommodating to all of our needs.,,,,,

Edward's hospitality was second to none. He was attentive, friendly and answered our questions almost immediately. He had great suggestions on how to enjoy Boston and what it has to offer. The apartment was exactly like the pictures and we felt very safe. Great staying there and hope to go back soon. Thanks for everything Edward."
322593,52573503,2015-10-31,39476823,Bruce,"We enjoyed our stay at the studio.  The full kitchen was great, allowing us to eat in for more than half of our meals. We only missed a small Teflon frying pan and egg flipper.  The couches were quite comfortable and the lounge chairs were fun to use while viewing the HUGE big screen TV.  Also the bed was very comfortable (though the sheets were slightly musty), the shower had good water pressure and the toilet flushed well.  The character of the studio was enhanced by the creative lighting and the multitude of books.  A heavy rain storm proved the apt to be watertight and bug free.  The walk out patio with large windows helped to bring light and openness into the basement unit. We would surely have used the patio dining table if the weather had been warmer.  Do realize that this is a basement unit with low, 7 foot ceilings and an uneven floor.  The narrow spiral staircase entry is tricky with suitcases, but the alley access through the patio door provides a better option.  Location was excellent in a  safe, upscale neighborhood with quick access to shops and restaurants on Tremont and Dartmouth Streets.  The Back Bay T station was close by and we walked easily to the Boston Common to take the Freedom Trail as well as to the Boston MFA."
Edward was an attentive host.  Upon arrival we had questions about some of the appliances in the kitchen.  He promptly met us in the apt to explain them.  As the ice machine was turned off,he offered to pay us for ice from the store.  He later returned with ice trays he purchased for our use.  The only unexpected event was the demolition of the neighbor's basement apartment for renovation.  The noise started each morning by 8 AM the first three days of our stay.  Edward was quite apologetic,explaining that the construction was not supposed to have started until the following week.  He did fairly compensate us by refunding a portion of our rental payment.  Ultimately,we had a positive stay at the studio.  When compared to hotel prices in the area (300+ dollars a night),"the studio saved us hundreds of dollars and gave us a locals experience of life in Boston that would have been missed at a hotel.   Thank you Edward for the wonderful stay!!!\"",

The apartment is lovely,comfortable and clean.  Longer-term rentals appear to have all they'll need to live comfortably,including a well-supplied kitchen,and a huge television.  Wifi was reliable (albeit not exactly blazing fast.). The bed and bedding were very comfortable. All in all,the space is very well done.  My favorite part was the beautiful patio.  I opted for the parking space,worth the extra $25 if you're driving. It's right outside the patio door.  I had meetings near downtown crossing. I was there literally 5 minutes after leaving the apt.
The neighborhood is perfect. It's really quiet,despite being so close to everything you'd need. It's safe and beautiful.,,,,
"Who would pay for a hotel room with options like this available?  I really dig this Airbnb thing. \"",,,,,

Ed was helpful and informative with suggestions of places to see, where to eat, and how to get around Boston.  It was like coming home to our apartment after a day of touring the city.  We enjoyed staying in a residential neighborhood and felt like we were part of the community, rather than being tourists while staying in a hotel.

The neighborhood is quiet but still in the heart of everything. Good restaurants with a ten minute walk and getting to the North End was about a 15 minute can ride. Being close to Tremont St really helps."
For me,who was at a conference at the Marriott Copley,the location could not have been better. It was about a 10 minute walk and that little bit of exercise was exactly what I needed each morning and evening.,,,

I did not utilize the transit system as I have driven to Boston. I had no problem finding parking on the street overnight and a metered spots are easy to negotiate.,,,,,
I had two minor complaints – the spiral  staircase into the apartment was difficult to negotiate with a large piece of luggage. Also if there are other guests in the apartment above the studio it is somewhat noisy when those guests walk around their own space.,,,,,

They had a great time and found everything to be as promised, although they  said that they were somewhat overwhelmed by the technology in the place. They had trouble figuring out how to use the microwave, stove, and entertainment systems. My mother apparently gave up on preparing a cup of tea and my father spent 30 minutes getting the tv to turn on. Edward was in frequent communication and I'm sure could have walked them through this had they decided to pursue his help. As it was, they enjoyed a great dinner in a fun neighborhood and had a comfortable place to sleep for the night. They said the onsite parking spot was ideal so I appreciate that this was an option to purchase."

Ed our host was fabulous! Very attentive and kind. There was a small problem with a water leak which he sorted straight away. There are dehumidifiers in the studio which are a little noisy but you can just turn off while inside the studio and back on when you leave.,,,,,
It was my partners birthday and he helped me organise cakes and a balloon which was ever so kind!,,,,,

322593,65035108,2016-03-10,44613775,Guofeng,The location is very convenient. I like the room decoration. the host made it very neat and comfortable. I wish I can stay the room on my next Boston trip.
322593,65953509,2016-03-18,54994955,Patrick,"\"What a very pleasant smell of lilies as we arrived in the studio ! Very well located in the centre of Boston, this place is really smartly designed, with all what you need. It's better to know that the spiral stairs to the apartment are very narrow and it is hard to get the luggage by them. Being French, we would suggest to Edward : put some good (French) wine bottles in your \"\"loft cellar\"\""
322593,66967265,2016-03-26,39304148,Sean,"Edward was a great host. The apartment was extremely nice, and Edward went out of his way to be very accommodating."
322593,67839287,2016-03-31,51536564,Annabel,"Very nice looking, spacious apartment in Boston South End. Short walk to and from CBD. Nice, safe area. Would recommend."
322593,69206931,2016-04-10,42318778,Kirsten,"Our stay here worked out wonderfully! We loved the cute feel of the studio and it had everything we needed. The location worked out really well for us. We felt like we got a good local experience, and we're easily able to get to the normal touristy attractions we were hoping to see. The apartment was very clean and private."
322593,70093162,2016-04-16,31344696,Humberto,"Ed is very professional as a host, everything is as he explains and the studio is in great condition. I was busy and did not had time to meet him except for a few minutes the day after my arrival. Great neighborhood, close to everything if you like walking as I do."
I will book again,"if and when ever in Boston again\"",,,,
322593,70659423,2016-04-19,33324339,Brittany,"Great place close to everything. Shops, pubs, Fenway and public transport. The Studio itself was perfect. Pictures are exactly what to expect. Great detail has been taken to assure everything is provided. Kitchen is well stocked with cooking items etc. Beg is a Queen size and is very comfortable."
Edward,the host gives great detailed instructions outlining the details of the Studio. To include wifi,entertainment,kitchen appliances and dwelling information.,,
I highly recommend this Studio and moreover Edwards hospitality.,,,,,

322593,72312033,2016-05-01,55556525,Nick,My wife and I took our first trip to Boston April 28 - May 1 and the experience was fantastic. Ed provided all of the information regarding the apartment before we arrived and was checking in with us the day of to determine when our flight arrived and if we needed anything one we arrived. The apartment itself was clean and looked just like the pictures.
The neighborhood is great! There are several restaurants and shops with in walking distance and an easy Uber/Cab ride to other parts of the city.,,,,,
Overall we had a wonderful experience and recommend Ed and this property to anyone looking for a nice and easy stay in Boston!,,,,,
Thanks,Ed!,,,,

322593,72924039,2016-05-05,10990562,Ignacio,Excelent Studio. More than We need for 3 days in Boston. Well ubicated (nice street) and easy to reach by public bus. Walking distante to nice neighbourhood back Bay and other nice sites as Boston garden.
322593,73374342,2016-05-08,6488649,Ruth,Edward welcomed us warmly and even invited us for a wine and cheese gathering. He responded immediately to all our queries.
322593,74924845,2016-05-17,29800851,Marla,The listing and pics were a perfect reflection of what to expect - a chic basement studio in one of the best locations in Boston.  Ed communicates regularly so there were no issues upon arrival and he even let us drop off luggage early in the morning of our stay so we weren't burdened with suitcases all day.
322593,75881892,2016-05-23,38297893,Martha,"The interior design and location was very good. Edward was all the time available and helpful. The apartment was clean and well equipped. We only missed kitchen towels,  place mats and paper napkins."
322593,76302680,2016-05-26,59826305,Daniel,"Had a wonderful time in Boston thanks to the great location of Ed's apartment. The neighborhood was safe and very walkable, with a secure and private parking space directly in front of the back entrance. We were greeted on arrival by Ed, and he was very accessible during our stay. The unit was cozy, but we definitely felt like we were in a basement unit. Also we felt a little weird about the fact that the windows next to the bed allowed people on the street to see in. The apartment has some mustiness issues, and our towels did not smell fresh. Though they try to keep this under control with a humidifier. The bathroom and shower are quite small (like a cruise ship), but the kitchen, leather sofas and book library are a big plus. Overall, we enjoyed our first experience with Airbnb."
322593,77130641,2016-05-30,34831164,Jo,"Staying at Ed's was our first ever Airbnb experience- we chose really well. Ed was so helpful before and during our visit. The apartment is fabulous and just as seen in the photos. Spotlessly clean, everything you could need and even special touches like make-up removal wipes."
The neighbourhood is very much to our taste - relaxed,cosmopolitan,clean with some great restaurants,bars and artisan shops. Everyone we met was incredibly friendly which made our trip even better.,,
We like to walk so were happy to make our way through the Common to the Northern side of town and the harbour and galleries. We strolled to Newbury Street for shopping and even walked to Harvard - others might prefer to use Uber.,,,,,
"We loved everything about Ed's and Boston. We wouldn't hesitate to book again\"",,,,,
322593,77924306,2016-06-04,3600277,Jason,I highly recommend a stay at Ed's place. It is in a superb location near many top restaurants and an easy walk to transport and the major shopping areas. The studio is clean and very spacious and has every amenity you could wish for.  Ed's is the perfect host and confirms just why a stay here is so much better than anything a hotel could offer. Thanks Ed for making my stay so enjoyable.
322593,85679291,2016-07-12,8713573,Cathy,"Edwards place was amazing!  It was on such a charming street with lovely brownstones.  This small little door and I felt like we were going down the rabbit hole into this adorable (and quite cool) apartment.  But don't be fooled; it isn't dark.  The one side opens into a small cute patio with plenty of light.  The rest is a combination of cool brick and eclectic glass and mirror that make the room seem so much larger.  More to this kitchen than we could possible need (I just really appreciated the coffee maker and coffee provided).  Very comfortable bed!  Location was awesome; great neighborhood with lots of close in restaurants, but we never paid more than approx $10-$12 for an uber ride no matter where we went. And we walked to Quincy Market.  And then there was Edward. With him you get a host and your own personal concierge if you need him.  He knows all the places to go and her gave great suggestions for dining.  He checked in via text to make sure if we needed anything and responded immediately to any questions we had.  Edward and his apartment made our anniversary weekend quite special.  I would highly recommend this place for a true Boston experience!"
322593,89957803,2016-07-30,1911807,Chris,"Edwards place is great.  The South End location is good if you want to be in that part of the city, close to restaurants and quiet.  Edwards communication was clear and friendly.  Entry to the apartment (three separate coded doors and a narrow spiral staircase) weren't a problem for us but could be cumbersome with luggage.  The apartment itself is clean, comfortable and modern."
322593,91322891,2016-08-04,23674934,Phillip,"The studio Edward offers guests on AirBnB is exactly as it appears in the images. - modern, clean and comfortable. It also comes with an eclectic library that is interesting in its own right!"
The instructions to get in and operate the amenities are clear & Edward was alway available to respond to a question. The kitchen is expansive and the seating through out the apartment is comfortable. It maybe a studio but it is thoughtfully divided into practical sections,each large enough to feel like the couches are not simply stuck in the sleeping area but separated logically by function.,,,,
If you are in need of proximity to the Prudential Center,Hines Convention facilities,or Northeastern University you couldn't pick a better spot. All are within easy walking distances. Just as easily you are at the Prudential T-stop for the E Green Line route I about 8 min walking from the brownstone. The time on the T to MIT is about 20 minutes & to Harvard Square 25 min. This is a great location to explore not just South Boston but the whole city.,,,
"Next time I need a place in Boston I hope the schedule is free.  \"",,,,,
322593,92885067,2016-08-10,28261350,Virginie,"As last year, Ed was extremely helpful accommodating my needs and requests. He is always available to answer any question. Thank you Ed for everything."

322593,95447170,2016-08-19,16907340,James,Fabulous!
322593,97185862,2016-08-26,31424597,Lollie,Great location but definitely not the cleanest place we have ever stayed.
Photos were quite deceptive - apartment is quite small and quite messy- lots of wiring from the tv and extension cables left hanging in front of bookshelves for example. Lots of shards of broken glass on the patio so you shouldn't go out barefoot. The apartment above has wooden floors so it is very very noisy - we didn't get a lot of sleep. The bed is a small double and is not very comfortable. Lots of books = lots of dust. The apartment was quite damp and the linen/towels didn't smell good. If you want to use the washer or dryer it's $1.75 a go so the first thing we did when we got there is re-wash the towels and linen and give the bathroom and kitchen a good clean!!,,,,,
The shower was weird - a plastic cubicle which felt very basic - noticed a lot of black mould in the sealant (as well as a LOT of black hairs on the bathroom floor which grossed me out!!) Opened the fridge and it had some old food in there and really needed a good clean.,,,,,
Great care has been taken when photographing the apartment - photos have been tactically taken and furniture moved so it looks bigger and brighter than it is.,,,,,
Overall if you just want location and a place to crash for a night then this place is fine - but we were on our honeymoon and stayed for five nights so we were very disappointed,especially when we came home to find the flat upstairs having a party on the supposedly private patio which looks directly into the apartment.,,,,
Sofas were quite worn and uncomfortable - carpets need replacing as they were thin and very stained. A/C was useless and noisy so the apartment was very very warm.,,,,,
Ed was a good communicator but it's always nice to arrive in an apartment that has fresh coffee/milk for example (we have sometimes been given a bottle of wine,especially when you pay as much as we did!) but unfortunately the only thing we found was mouldy food! we have stayed in a few air bnb places and this is the first negative review I have had to write. I wouldn't recommend this place. I would however recommend the area - it was really the only thing that we liked about our stay.,,,,

Clean, modern, comfy, and very convenient to get to downtown. The blue line is in about 10-min walking distance, and it is only one stop to cross the river. Most importantly, Carolyn is the best host ever! She is so sweet and warm, made a lot efforts to fit our schedule and help us get around. We'll definitely come back for another trip!"

5616179,32532679,2015-05-19,1658448,Ian,Carolyn was awesome!! She was very welcoming and knowledgeable about the Boston area. She gave us some great advice on places to eat and check out. Left us to be independent when we needed.

5616179,33806705,2015-06-01,12351587,Sandy,Carolyn's place is exactly how the pictures depict and even more. The guest bedroom is spacious & the bedding super comfortable.
The morning  water taxi across the harbor is amazing,the sunset ride back is spectacular.  Moreover,Carolyn is an inspiring,enlightening person that I am happy to have met.,,
"I would undoubtedly stay at Carolyn's again if my travels lead me back to Boston.\"",,,,,
5616179,34171083,2015-06-05,6151509,Jenni,Carolyn's home is just as the pictures show: modern and pristine! Since my friend and I only had a few days in Boston we didn't spend too much time at her house but the time we did spend was quiet and comfortable. I would definitely stay at her place again if I need a place.
"A very easy walk from Maverick Station and a quick 5 minute ride downtown! \"",,,,,
5616179,35250870,2015-06-16,34679496,Ingrid,"We were disappointed that Carolyn wasn't going to be there when we were as we were really excited about meeting her Everyone had said such good things! It was really hot when we were there, and as per the listing the house is not air conditioned. There were no fans either, which would have made a big difference. When we opened the windows that helped immensely, but the neighbors were noisy and cigarette smoke wafted through the window. The window covering provided privacy but no darkening, which was a problem for us in the morning, as we were pretty much up with the sun. The bed was too firm, futon like, and we both had backaches in the morning, very unusual for us. Otherwise, the house and location were as described, and very clean."
5616179,37503770,2015-07-07,33446830,Victor,Beautiful place and cozy! Would've love to be able to spend more time in it!

Carolyn is an amazingly warm and sweet host. Not to mention her home is incredibly warm and comfortable. Also it is perfectly organized, clean, neat - actually immaculate and was a perfect spot to stay. I would and will be back when I am back in town."
5616179,39930640,2015-07-27,32851755,Mary,"Charming room in a nice area of East Boston.  Convenient to the Metro and airport.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable.  Additionally, there was access to the kitchen.  Carolyn was interesting and accommodating, making sure that she was at home when I arrived, even when I came in on an earlier flight than originally scheduled.  She provided tips for things to see while I was in town, even though I had a fairly tight schedule."
5616179,40766663,2015-08-02,3765151,Leona,"I had the most incredible stay with Carolyn! It made my whole trip to Boston. The apartment is absolutely beautiful, even better than the pictures. The room was perfect – really comfortable bed, quiet neighbourhood, easy to get downtown – and Carolyn was the best host ever! She made me feel totally at home, was  a pleasure to get to know, and was super helpful with directions/ restaurant recommendations etc. I also got the chance to do a reiki and yoga session with Carolyn – would totally recommend! Can't wait to visit again!"
5616179,41867022,2015-08-09,1930307,Lisa Marie,"Carolyn treated me more like family or a friend than a renter. I loved her house from the minute I saw it on the photos and it was even better when I stayed. I loved the cute fairy lights that glittered onto the warm wood furniture and couture, yet historic brick work. I enjoyed the great amount of light that filled all the very clean rooms, as well as the sweet park across the street. Her supply of natural soaps is indicative of the care she gives to the health and heart of the planet and her guests. The bedroom is regal, with large amounts of storage for one’s bags and clothes. I felt secure staying there alone, as her friends lived nearby and the neighbors are all so kind and eager to help. The neighborhood is quiet with a nearby (5min walk) fantastic Indian restaurant as well as famous Italian pizzeria. There are tiny food stores along the 8min walk to the metro which takes one across to Boston’s city center in just 2 stops. At the same time, it only cost me $12 by taxi to get her place from the airport. Overall, the aura of this much appreciated historical beauty of a home matched the persona of the Carolyn, warm, eclectic, fresh and top quality. I’m grateful for the stay."
5616179,43386247,2015-08-19,13648019,Carmen,"This listing was exactly as described.  The location is perfect, for example,  if you have a conference at the WTC or BCEC, as you are only 3 blocks from the water taxi stop that takes you right there.  The bed was very comfortable, the neighborhood was quiet, and there was internet access and a private bath.   The hostess was friendly and helpful, and not intrusive.  I would definitely consider this place again next time I am in Boston."

And check out KO Pies in the shipyard for a close and unique dinner experience away from the tourist hubs."

The room was nice and cozy with a comfortable bed and lots of space for our bags. The shower has great pressure and lots of hot water, and Carolyn provided lovely soaps and nice towels.

Carolyn gave us some advice on places to go/things to visit around the city, and we thoroughly enjoyed our time in the city!"

Carolyn is a warm and charming host, very easy to communicate to, and her place is cute and artistic. Her place looks just as in the photos, and even better in real. The room we stayed in is spacious and air-conditioned. It has a large new closet with plenty of hangers. The bathroom Carolyn gave us private access to is modernly decorated and clean. I feel quite comfortable at Carolyn's place, just like staying at home. Location wise, Carolyn's place is 5-10 min walking distance away from the metro, and only two stops away from the Government Center station in central Boson, around 20 min Uber distance to Cambridge (takes longer with morning traffic, but not more than 30min). The neighborhood is safe. I went out jogging alone at 9-10 pm at night and still saw many people on the street. Best part of the neighborhood is a short walk to the Pier's park and Massport Harborwalk, beautiful view of Boston at sunset and in the evenings. Fun for running too."

Penny provided breakfast items,including coffee,muffins and fresh fruit,which we enjoyed on her sweet back patio one of our two mornings.,,
The room is as described,with a lovely view through the tall windows and trees.  The bed was very comfortable,the house and neighborhood were quiet and we slept very well both nights.,,,
The house is located in a great neighborhood,full of shops and restaurants within an easy walk.  Penny informed us of the art festival going on the weekend we were there and we were able to enjoy a bit of it.   We wished we'd had more time!,,,,
We had a family member at Brigham and Women's Hospital,which was a very short drive away.  The house is close to many Boston destinations,yet still reasonably priced.,,,
Despite its central location,the townhouse is located in a little hidden area that you wouldn't otherwise notice (we thought we were turning into an alley when we first turned onto Penny's street).  It was so great to be a bit off the beaten path,in such a bustling city - to be both in the thick of things,and have shady seclusion and quiet at the same time.  I will look forward to staying in Penny's tree house,"again.\"",

She invited us to make ourselves at home which is very clean and attractive. Our master suite, on the third level, was clean, private, and quiet. She had light breakfast foods that we could prepare at our convenience. Her home is a short walk from many restuarants and interesting sites. We plan to stay with Penny again on future trips to JP."
6238463,50795661,2015-10-14,45555464,Jason,The experience was awesome!  i almost want to find a way to hide Penny's house from airbnb search so i don't have to worry about not getting the room next time i visit Boston.
Joke aside,i really appreciate Penny's hospitality and the level of her thoughtfulness is unbelievable.,,,,
Staying with Penny was the best part of my trip to Boston and i am looking forward to next time i visit her again.,,,,,

6238463,52161233,2015-10-26,46793570,Stephanie,"Penny make us feel right at home as soon we entered. The room is exactly as described and very lovely. A perfect little retreat, quietly nestled amongst the trees. Parking was also a great perk and the T is in walking distance. JP shops right down the street. We will stay here again! Thank you!"
6238463,53836011,2015-11-13,14608094,Tony,"We felt confident from the photos and the reviews that we would have an enjoyable stay with Penny and her son Dakota and we were not disappointed by either the room and its en suite or by the general atmosphere of their home and hospitality. Penny has plenty of great information about the locality to share for those who want it, and we had a good chats without feeling pressure to do so. We wanted some quiet time to reflect and found the room, with its great view of trees, homes and a church, a great place to do that. From previous experience of Boston my wife and I were very familiar with Jamaica Plain, but were pleasantly surprised to find Penny's home was in a quite special area of JP we didn't know about...a little sanctuary nestled away from the hustle and bustle yet just a couple of minutes walk from Center Street's restaurant's, cafes, shops and buses. All the technicalities were really well handled from pre-communications to food available for breakfast and snacks. We would be most happy to return again on a future visit!"
6238463,57920318,2015-12-30,19804193,Hannah,I reserved this space for my father who was coming to visit from Europe. It couldn't have been a more pleasant experience from the second we booked to when he left. The house is exactly as described and Penny was a joy to work with.
6238463,59942150,2016-01-17,29716535,Annabel,"My friend and I stayed at this place during our trip to Boston. We greatly enjoyed our stay! Penny is such a sweet, kind, and warm host. She helped us with anything we needed and always greeted us with a smile when we came down. The room was very cozy, clean and huge. Safe and quiet neighborhood with easy access to public transit! We had a really great time staying with Penny and we were truly sad to leave. We would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston and we are looking forward to staying with Penny next time!"

6238463,62664740,2016-02-15,27977977,Aneydi,"It was Valentine's weekend and my bf & I decided we wanted to spend it in Boston. We picked Penny's place because of it's charm, great reviews, and convenience to the T (Boston's transit system). Penny was a wonderful host ! We booked our stay during negative 10 degree weather, but Penny made sure we stayed warm by providing us with extra blankets and an additional space heater. She even made me a cup of hot coco to warm up after a full day of walking around in the cold. She also dropped us off at the train a couple times."
At first we had a little trouble with the lock to the front entrance of the house,but then we realized we could also access the back which was easier for us.,,,,
Penny's home was lovely. The details in her home show her warm personality. The room itself is very cozy with a cute reading nook,an inspiring quote in the bathroom,comfy bed,"and the large window with a great view ! For our last stop in Boston we stayed close by checking out the Sam Adams brewery which is a 15 min. walk from Penny's. We wanted to explore more of the JP neighborhood but unfortunately we didn't have the time. We hope to return during a warmer time to  enjoy more. Thank you Penny for a memorable weekend stay :-)\"",,

She was a kind host who helped me out with a special accommodation. I loved the location, thank you so much for a wonderful experience!!"
6238463,66557283,2016-03-23,58108042,Brian,"My girlfriend and I came up to Boston for St. Pattys day weekend. Penny's place was awesome. Clean, comfortable, and just far enough from the crazy Boston streets to allow us to retreat for the night or a quick nap between attractions. Penny's house is beautiful, located on a secluded little street with a lively brick walkway. Everything that you could need was placed in the room for us, we didn't even need to bring anything. Waking up to the skylight and the trees daily was an added benefit. Penny was available and communicative when needed and also gave us our privacy. I would recommend a stay with Penny to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay in a diverse neighborhood of Boston."
6238463,66934952,2016-03-25,23739875,Anna Paola,I just stayed at Penny's home for a short visit to Boston with my daughter. We loved everything about it. The room is very prívate and comfortable. Clean and welcoming.
Penny is a wonderful host,"warm and happy.\"",,,,
6238463,68429547,2016-04-04,26271226,Emily,"My mother and I stayed with Penny when we traveled to the Boston area to see my daughter, and our stay was fantastic!  Penny is welcoming and generous with space, kitchen use, breakfast foods, and amenities.  There was nothing we wanted for.  She even made a make-shift bed for my daughter, who needed a break from the dorm.  Penny loves Jamaica Plain for good reason and was helpful in making suggestions for things to do and places to eat in JP and the greater Boston area, as well as giving accurate information for the best way to get to our destinations.  We will definitely be staying with Penny again on future visits.  Thanks for everything, Penny!"
6238463,70188029,2016-04-16,62763421,John,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was just what we were looking for. The description was accurate and Penny made the experience exceptional. She gave us a lot of good tips on where to eat, how to get the train, etc. we felt very safe. The house was clean, and we felt right at home. We would recommend staying with Penny to anyone staying in the Boston area. And there was plenty to do and see right in Jamaica Plain, such as the Sam Adams brewery and plenty of cool restaurants."
6238463,70743128,2016-04-20,65250533,Lori,"Penny was a great host - couldn't have been more helpful with directions for getting around, restaurant/shopping suggestions, etc. She made us feel completely at home and most welcome. We loved the house, the location, the entire experience. Would love to visit again in the future."
6238463,73076741,2016-05-06,66748359,Mary,"\"We had an exceptional stay at the Pvt Tree Top room. The neighborhood was inviting and convenient to transportation.  The view beautiful, relaxing and peaceful. We were in Boston for graduation. We immediately felt comfortable and at home with Penny.  She is a wonderful host and was very accommodating to our busy schedule, as well as providing helpful information.  We would love to stay with her when we get to Boston again as our experience was \"\"Over the Tree Top!!\"\"\""
6238463,73953197,2016-05-11,978209,Elaine,"Comfortable room, friendly and welcoming host. Penny was great, a very thoughtful host. Room is on 3rd floor, very clean, very private. Nice clean bathroom with a shower with very good water pressure. The room looks out on a lovely quiet neighborhood. We'd definitely stay here again."
6238463,74534474,2016-05-15,45287533,David,Penny was very polite and welcoming. The room has a beautiful view. It felt like I was staying at a family members house. My wife and I were very comfortable.
6238463,75612737,2016-05-22,20133256,Carol,We were very pleased with our stay with Penny.  Her third floor is quiet and charming and we liked the location in Jamaica Plain.  Penny was a thoughtful host and was responsive and easy to make arrangements with.  She offered valuable advice on nearby attractions.  We highly recommend staying here and hope we can do it again ourselves!
6238463,76390000,2016-05-27,71210898,Carol,"Great first experience with AirBnb.  The room was perfect and Penny was a wonderful host.  Location was convenient for walking to restaurants, shops and the T.  Would highly recommend this listing."
6238463,80616281,2016-06-19,57386871,Sara,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I was thrilled!  I loved Penny's place.  The private room and bath were perfect.  I haven't slept that well in months!  The room was lovely, beautiful trees outside the large windows and even a skylight.  Penny was helpful when needed but also gave me my privacy.  The Jamaica Plain area was outstanding.  I spent a good part of my week in the Boston area just exploring all Jamaica Plain has to offer.  Penny's house is in a fabulous location that is walking distance to several awesome restaurants and shops at well as a convenient T station.  I would definitely recommend a stay to anyone looking for a calm place to stay in the Boston area.  I hope to go back again!"
6238463,81601722,2016-06-24,25112730,Jeremy,"Penny's place was fantastic, my wife and I and our 18 month old son (we got an OK from her to show up with a kid before hand) had a great time staying in her beautiful place in JP. I think its actually better than the photos show, quiet and up in the trees but walking distance to everything we needed in town. Great little getaway and easy to get to other parts of Boston from there. Penny and her son were wonderful hosts, made us feel at home in their house."
6238463,83541518,2016-07-03,80041531,David,We had a very pleasant stay in a terrific space in a great location. We hope to use this again in the future.

She made certain I knew where I was going, what to expect etc.  While I was there, she also checked in regularly to make sure I had all the information I needed even though she left a very helpful \"\"handbook\"\"."
Penny's home is very well located,it was easy to get to most places in Boston.  In addition,although her home is in quiet neighborhood,it is also in walking distance to a variety of shops and good restaurants.,,
My bedroom could not have been better.  It was located up two short staircases and had beautiful views of trees and a church steeple.  The bedroom was stylishly furnished and had a very comfortable bed outfitted with very nice linens. It was also so good to have a desk to land a laptop on and a very comfortable reading chair!  The private bath  was so convenient and had an excellent shower.,,,,,
Although Penny's home had many good features,including beautiful art and throughout  I most appreciated the cleanliness of the suite and the rest of the home.,,,,
Many thanks to Penny and Dakota for their kind hospitality!,,,,,

6238463,93633720,2016-08-13,87405316,Ameya,Penny is a great host! She was very helpful in guiding us around the city of Boston. The place was clean all the time and very safe and convenient location. Worth the first priority to stay here (if it is available) if you are travelling to Boston.
76073,233328,2011-04-20,477918,Phil,"Very Clean and comfortable with a lot of nice touches. This was our first time renting a house instead of a hotel and we will do it again. Great to be able to park the car, use public transport and not hassle with traffic."
76073,278440,2011-05-24,456260,Kathleen,"Everything was great!! perfect layout for multiple guests/couples, the house was very clean, the breakfast provided was perfect, the location is great close to the bus and to other little shops, there was parking for 2 cars and only a 15 minute car ride from kenmore square... overall fantastic!!"
76073,315635,2011-06-15,466098,Cheryl,"We stayed in this spacious home for a full week while preparing and attending our son's wedding.  The house had lots of room;  the hostess was gracious in allowing us to cook meals, having guests for dinner, and using her laundry facilities.  We also found the location to be very convenient to many of the other places we needed to be, and having parking spaces for two cars in her driveway was also very helpful.  Cable  television was something we really appreciate as well and I found the use of her computer for some last minute details very convenient."
76073,351377,2011-07-04,459230,Bonnie,"Randi's home is gorgeous and comfortable. It is in a wonderful neighborhood filled with great little restaurants and fun shops. We hugely enjoyed our stay, and the jacuzzi was a wonderful surprise."
76073,422777,2011-08-05,664214,Nicolas,The host canceled my reservation 63 days before arrival.
76073,500815,2011-09-04,522630,Drew,"I stayed at Randi's for three days while helping move my daughter change apartments.  I found it clean, large, affordable and convenient.  The house is in a nice area of Boston with easy access to the bus line.  There is a YMCA close by for an early morning swim or workout. The Thai restaurant at the corner is delightful.   I highly recommend this house."
76073,596261,2011-10-04,465817,Tony,Great house in a lovely suburb of Boston. Close to Bus and T line into Boston Centre.
Randi also added some lovely touches to our stay that we welcomed very much. Much better value than using hotels downtown if you have a group of more than 2.,,,,,
House was very clean and well presented.,,,,,
"We will use this home again if we stay in Boston.\"",,,,,
76073,681151,2011-11-01,1253263,Lily,"Everything was great about the house. The house itself was cozy and comfy. It was not hard at all to go around the neighborhood. It was near many shops and restaurants. Transportation was very convenient. Randi was great in providing specific details about the house, supplies, and everything else. She even provided extra blankets. Also, we loved to cook, so the kitchen was full of supplies that we were able to use. The only issue we had was we did not realize that a pet previously stayed at the house and one of our room mates was allergic to cats and dogs. So she ended up sneezing through the night. However aside from that, the house and the host is awesome!"
76073,885962,2012-01-27,1613452,Margaret,"I stayed at Randi's home for two nights with my documentary film crew of 6, and we couldn't have been more pleased the house. There was plenty of space and enough beds for everyone to be comfortable. The house was clean, spacious, and the location was perfect for us (we were driving into Cambridge)."
I would definitely recommend the house for groups traveling for work,or for any other reason.,,,,
Also,"Randi was a very good host and answered all of our questions for us! No delays in her response time and she was happy to be available to us if we needed her.\"",,,,
76073,996055,2012-03-13,615392,Marvin,"The home is just as Randi described it, we loved having the three bedrooms and there's a small fourth on the 3rd floor which also has a computer we were invited to use but there is wireless internet so we did not need to. The home is convenient to the bus and numerous restaurants, mostly pizza and Asian as well as a Dunkin Donuts. It's not particularly close to the Boston metro area (it's a $44 cab ride, with tip) but perfect for us as we were touring Boston College and University. We would stay there again, it was a great value!"
76073,1108037,2012-04-11,1485055,Sophie,Randi's place was beautiful.  We really enjoyed our stay.  The pictures are exactly what we expected when we got there.  The house had more then enough room for everyone.  Thank you Randi for making my first AirBnB booking a success!
76073,1146716,2012-04-18,1177417,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful time at Randi's house.  Great old house and fun little neighborhood.  Randi was easy to communicate with and had everything ready for our stay.  We explored Boston by public transit, if you have the time, it's an easy and  relaxing way to go.  This was our first AirBnB experience and we're already recommending it to all our friends."
76073,1163295,2012-04-22,1918820,Craig,Great place highly recommend this house  and will go back in the future . A+++
76073,1360284,2012-05-28,1220403,Luz Maria,I rented the home for 10 days so I could attend my two children's college graduation. The second day we stayed my family and I felt very comfortable with the house and neighborhood. By far a better choice than staying at a hotel.  We had wonderful dinners and enjoyed the jacuzzi in the evenings.  Thank you Randi for allowing us to stay in your beautiful home.
76073,1643062,2012-07-06,2604231,Joni,"Had a lovely time June 30-July 6 at Randi's house. It was perfect for our family of 5 to be able to spread out and relax at the end of our busy, hectic days. Walked a few blocks to the bus stop (57) and took it to the T and everywhere in Boston! The house was clean, spacious with no problems whatsoever. A little hot with no air conditioning, but there were window units in 2 of the bedrooms and we were able to sleep comfortably. I can't even imagine staying in a cramped hotel room (much less the cost) for that time! Very satisfied."
76073,2270047,2012-09-11,2522107,Honor,The reservation was canceled 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
76073,2699104,2012-10-24,3522199,Jan,We had a perfect time at Randi's house. It is very clean and spacious and it offers really everything you can think of. The kitchen is well equipped and it is possible to cook for even eight or more guests.
The area is very quiet and restaurants and shops are in walking distance and the bus around the corner will bring you directly to the city center.,,,,,
Randi answered all our questions immediately and helped us a lot. When we come back to Boston,"we already know where we would like to stay.\"",,,,
76073,2876286,2012-11-13,3694616,Elizabeth,"Randi's house is big and beautiful! We were two couples, plus two kids, & we celebrated an early Thanksgiving with my parents there are were all incredibly comfortable.  Some members of our party had work to do: there was a little office at the top, and the house was big enough that they could work there undisturbed. There is so much SPACE in the house, and beautiful light.  It's also wonderfully located in Oak Square, Brighton--my parents live in Newton, so it was close to that, but also to Boston, the Turnpike, etc. A full bath on the second floor and a nice half bath on the first.   The house is cosy but not fussy, many places to sit downstairs (two living rooms, formal dining room, big kitchen.)  It was really perfect for us."
76073,3885644,2013-03-25,2751065,Daniel,"Randi's house was absolutely wonderful.  Lots of different spaces to relax, talk, and of course eventually sleep :)  She gave us everything we needed to make our stay awesome, including a pie!"
76073,5482851,2013-07-02,5377622,Ellen,I stayed at Randi's house for four nights with my family the end of june. We were 6 adults and 4 children from 5-1 years of age. There was lots of room for everyone. The kitchen was well equipped   and there was a bbq as well. Although the house wasn't air conditioned  there were fans in each room. The beds were comfortable and the house was clean. Randi answered all of my questions promptly. The house  was ideally located to go in any direction. The local merchants  were friendly as was the fireman at the firehall who welcomed the kids. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again
76073,6022452,2013-07-27,6401719,Erik,"Great house! We had a wonderful stay at Randi's house during our conference in Cambridge, MA. Much better than a hotel."
76073,6509323,2013-08-15,4720791,Serge,"Randi's house was a perfect accommodation for me and 3 of my friends: spacious, well-equipped, centrally located, clean and authentic! The hot tub in the backyard was relaxing at nights... Randi was also helpful with all the questions that we had. There's a parking lot near the house which is a savior in Boston. Thanks! Perfect vacation."
76073,7411775,2013-09-19,1460598,Lauren & Alex,We had a great time staying at Randi's house. It is spacious and well equipped. Randi responded quickly to all our queries. We have been very happy with our stay. Thank you!
76073,7574551,2013-09-25,5907632,Kath,Randi's house was really spacious and suited our purpose really well as a family visiting to attend wedding. it had a lovely lived in feel about it and we felt right at home there. This was helped also by the generosity of Randi leaving provisions in the kitchen for us to enjoy. It is in a lovely neighbourhood and people around were helpful in providing information when needed.
76073,8212997,2013-10-21,3522199,Jan,"This was already the second time we stayed at Randi's house. It is a wonderful location. The house is very spacious, well equipped and very cosy. The rooms, kitchen and bathrooms were all very clean. The area is quiet and you can get into town with public transportation easily. If we come back to Boston, this would be our first choice again. Highly recommended!"
76073,12108173,2014-04-23,9079592,Joel,"Randi's house is lovely, old, clean, and comfortable, and we had a great stay for Marathon weekend.  It's definitely not a sterile hotel experience, which suited our group perfectly.  A word to the wise -- the stairs can be steep, which become especially noticeable after a tough day.  Although it isn't in the heart of Boston, there are plenty of resources nearby for the visitor, and we had a great stay here."
76073,12265872,2014-04-28,9984813,Amy,"Randi's home was very comfortable. We all felt as of we were at home. Spacious and welcoming. Our moms group travels to a different city once a year. This was our first experience with airbnb and we were very happy. Randi had lots of clean towels, food in the fridge, and was helpful with our stay. Located conveniently to transportation and the freeway."
76073,13127222,2014-05-20,6227852,Rose,"Randi was a wonderful and welcoming host. She was extremely easy to reach and quickly responded to emails. The house was spotless and provided ample space for 6 adults, with room to spare. After a long day of travel, we were welcomed with juice and milk in the fridge, coffee, tea and breakfast items."
The location was perfect and residential neighborhood lovely for a walk.,,,,,
"Highly recommend!\"",,,,,
76073,19068449,2014-09-06,15684892,David,Our host was extremely courteous and left us some general provisions for when we arrived. This was a great help. The house is situated in Brighton. There are a number of take away restaurants at the end of the road and across the square which do beautiful food and came in very handy on a number of occasions. The 57 Bus and the Subway give you great access to downtown Boston and if you buy a 7 day ticket it saves on looking for fares each time and is actually great value.
76073,20544331,2014-10-01,11412513,Niamh,"Exactly as described! ! Large, Beautiful house. Suited our party perfectly (2 children, parents & grand parents). More than adequate space. Location suited us great (wanted to be close to Brighton) however it is very easy to make it to downtown Boston using public transport/taxis. Host left very useful note for us on our arrival. Highly recommend this property"
76073,21372713,2014-10-16,11618308,Katherine,"We spent a week in Randi's house, grandparents, parents and 2 small children. Randi communicated well with us and phoned the day after our arrival to make sure everything was OK. The house is spacious and we felt at home. Useful driveway for our rental car. Randi left us helpful information and some nice food items."
"There is a small childrens' playground at the bottom of the road which was very useful while we were all getting over jet lag.\"",,,,,
76073,22559235,2014-11-09,6383076,Angela,"Randi's place is lovely and the neighborhood is great with lots of stores and bars, etc nearby. Randi is very generous and offers breakfast as well. Very nice place."
76073,23383525,2014-11-30,9944711,Wilfredo,"\"Our stay in this home hosted by Randi Schalet was excellent!  We needed it to host a Thanksgiving dinner of 12 people and this setting allowed us to do so comfortably.  Everyone fit at the table since Randi added leaves to the table to extend it and she also provided additional chairs.  The first floor is accurately described as \"\"beautiful\"\".  It has all sorts of interesting art on display in the main living room and the adjacent family room.  There were plenty of  sofas and chairs to allow for different groups to huddle and talk.  There is an upright piano between the living room and dining room and looks exactly as seen in the Airbnb photos advertising the property.  The sound system was very good and included a large collection of music CD's that coincided perfectly with our taste in music!  The kitchen was large enough for several cooks and has a nice large oven"
76073,30373605,2015-04-21,15677640,Michelle,"The house was great for our Boston Marathon group. Randi checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed and the house was easy access to the bus station and Dunkin Donuts for coffee on the way to the city. The neighborhood is nice and we enjoyed being able to walk to the local pizza/pasta place when we arrived. One minor bummer was the Futon bed in the TV room is the walkway between the front door, other rooms and kitchen so you better want to go to bed last and wake up first - not the best place for a teenager, at least not the wake up first part!"
76073,31760842,2015-05-10,24856206,Kim,"Wonderful home in a great location.  In walking distance to public transportation and places to eat and drink so no need for a vehicle.  The house was as described and suited us 5 well with room to spare.  Randi left us a few breakfast items and incidentals to get us started which is a nice touch.  Randi was also helpful with recommending a reasonably priced taxi to and from the airport as we did not rent a vehicle.  All and all, we had a wonderful trip and I would recommend this house to anyone coming to the area."
76073,32443148,2015-05-18,17080668,Carole,"She made us feel welcome by caring about our ease to check in and by providing some breakfast goodies so that we did not have to go searching for food as soon as we arrived.  She also checked in on us via a phone message to ensure all worked out well.  Another big help was that she left us current bus routes and maps so that we could manipulate Boston's transit system.  Our experience was great!  Kids were very happy and adjusted well to a very busy weekend, mainly because Randi had lots of games to entertain them with.  The setup of the house really is perfect for multi-family events in that children have spaces to play in while adults can enjoy more solitude for chat while still be close enough to monitor kids."
76073,32975595,2015-05-24,29824618,Stella,Randi has prepared everything nicely for us. The instruction to enter the house and use all facilities were very clear and the snakes and fruits were such a nice surprise. The house is gorgeous and spacious. Our group had a wonderful time at this house.
76073,33489770,2015-05-29,2157606,Jaimie,"Rented the house for out of town guests for a graduation. Used the house to host two dinners. The house was very nice and clean. It was great that Randi left coffee, tea, and welcoming treats (baked goods). Great location for our gathering -- easy access to both Boston and Cambridge, but in a nice quiet neighborhood (but with stores for a quick run to get eggs!). Enough space for everyone to sleep comfortably and to relax during downtime with others dropping over. Easy parking (the house's off-street parking space fit three cars wedged back to back to back). Definitely would recommend to others."
76073,38881909,2015-07-19,2291883,Nghia,We stayed at Randi's place for 3 nights.  The house was spacious and we feel safe in the neighborhood.  Thank you Randi for the fruit and bread.  I enjoyed the privacy; Randi and I only texted each other few times.  We rented a car so we drove around.  My main concern for the house was the broken handrails.  We have small children so it was constant watching them worrying that they will fall over the stairs.  Hopefully Randi will fix those handrails.
76073,39796202,2015-07-26,36613951,Kathryn,The host left breakfast food for our family which was much appreciated. She also called and checked in to make sure we had arrived and had all the information we needed.
76073,41196389,2015-08-05,31061070,Rebecca,"Just what we were hoping for on our holiday! This large welcoming house easily accommodated our group of 6 for the week, and Randi's basket of breakfast items and flowers were a warm and welcoming gesture. Quite close to parks (for kids) and shops, local Thai place was wonderful!! Helpful local tips and guides were provided by Randi, easy to get around using public transport but the T was a small drive away (a bus stop was very close though). Hot tub was a big draw card for us and didn't disappoint!  Randi was easily accessible by email and flexible given our late flights.  If you have small children like we did, you might want to move some of the beautiful ornaments out of harms way, especially from the stairs.  We had a great stay and would definitely recommend to others looking to stay in Boston."
76073,42849369,2015-08-16,26473275,Ebenezer,"The house welcomes you with open arms, it is spacious and well appointed for hosting a large group. Although it lacked central air- conditioning, it remained comfortable during our 5 day stay."
76073,45986797,2015-09-07,35213077,Brandon,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I could not be happier! Even prior to our stay, Randi was incredibly accommodating and helpful! With regards to the house, the listing does not even do it justice. The house is huge and can absolutely fit 10 people comfortably! It is also very VERY close to the bus line that will take you right into Boston near Fenway Park!! Upon our arrival we noticed that Randi had left us with wonderful breakfast treats and fresh fruit and vegetables! She even provided us with a detailed description of the house and how to get around using the nearby public transportation. Lastly, she had toiletries provided, which was extremely helpful to many of us who had forgotten specific bathroom items. All in all, she was an amazing host, and I only hope she felt the same way about us after our stay. Thanks, Randi!"
76073,48894518,2015-09-29,38060275,Simon,Le logement est parfait ! Les lits sont très confortables et la maison correspond tout à fait à l'annonce.
Randi a été une hôte formidable : très arrangeante et très attentionnée. Elle a fait en sorte que sa maison devienne notre le temps du séjour !,,,,,
Et puis,quel régal de finir sa journée dans le jacuzzi !!!!,,,,
"Je recommande à 100%\"",,,,,
76073,51121526,2015-10-18,34684546,Ronnie,Randi's house is beautiful spacious house and as advertised.  It is situated in a nice quiet residential neighborhood with one (could be two) off-street parking.  Street parking is also available in the neighborhood.  Location is convenient by car. Bus service is available nearby.
Randi is a good responsive host and welcomes us to the house with milk,"orange juice and pastries placed in the refrigerator. \"",,,,
76073,58312487,2016-01-02,41855394,Kylie,"Randi was a great hostess.  She made herself available at all times even though we didn't really need her because everything was as described.  The house was great, lots of space and very well located. The only issue was trying to find parking because there was only one spot for us in the driveway and the street gets very full very fast."
76073,60110831,2016-01-18,37070387,Maira,The host canceled this reservation 128 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

76073,74673716,2016-05-16,36745591,Carol,"This home was fabulous.  When we got there Randi had left us some treats to make us feel at home.  We had a great time as a family.  The location was perfect, easy and convenient. Wonderful restaurant on the bottom of the hill. I felt comfortable and homey. Randi had also left us information about thing to do in the area as well as the bus and train schedule and how to get there. I would recommend this home to my friend who travel to Boston often with their families."
76073,76240636,2016-05-25,2662572,Adele,My family enjoyed our stay at Randi's house. There were 9 of us in total and the house was plenty large enough. The house is close to Boston College and made our trips back and forth to campus very easy.
76073,86010390,2016-07-14,32233679,Sarah,Randi is a very caring host and owner of a beautiful antique home that is a simple walk from public transportation and great food (award winning Thai food around the corner!) Her house lends itself to large families and groups traveling together.  She has added small details that make your stay easy and pleasant. I particularly enjoyed the art and books that are plentiful in this house.

-Flexible check-in and check-out time,,,,,

Cons:,,,,,
-Power went off in the house the day of a wedding my family was preparing and the owner could not be reached to locate the Power console to turn on the power.  (It's located in the basement which is accessible through a door behind a dishwasher). The owner called back the next day around 5pm.,,,,,
-The Wifi does not work on the first floor. We tried for days to get service but no phone,IPad,or Computer could connect.,,,

I walked from the condo to the south T station,and felt very safe in the neighborhood. Their are several restaurants and coffee shops nearby.,,,,
I also found that ubering anywhere from here was extremely reasonable! I'm not sure I ever spent more than ten dollars to get anywhere.,,,,,
I would recommend staying here over a hotel where parking is not included,and check in times are so rigid.,,,,
The condo itself was beautiful,quiet,and very clean. I slept on the couch both nights,and actually preferred it to my bed back home!,,
I can't say enough about how great James treated us,"and how welcome I felt at his home.\"",,,,

James was a great host,"even though we didn't have a chance to meet in person. He gave specific instructions on where to park and how to check-in. The pictures don't do this place justice! It was extremely clean and welcoming. The views of the beach and sunset were truly amazing! I wish I could've stayed longer!\"",,,,

The shower head broke one night while we were there, and Jeff had it fixed the very next day with a brand new shower head! Clean space, air conditioner in room to keep us cool, and cute kids/dogs. Nice neighborhood, shops/restaurants just a 15 minute walk away. Would highly recommend staying here, my only regret is that we were so busy we didn't have much time to get to know our host."

Jeff et son conjoint sont d'excellents hôtes! Ils sont très accueillants et nous font sentir comme à la maison. Leur maison est superbe et spacieuse. La chambre est tranquille et on n'entend pas ce qui se passe dans le reste de la maison,car c'est au 3e étage. Jeff a été super gentil de prendre le temps de nous conseiller quoi visiter en ville et ses conseils ont été judiscieux. Ses enfants sont charmants. Excellent pour couples ou visiteurs LGBT. Je recommande! :-D,,,,
Jeff and his husband are excellent hosts! They are very friendly and make us feel at home. Their house is beautiful and spacious. The room is quiet and you can not hear what is happening in the rest of the house,"because it is on the 3rd floor. Jeff was super nice to take the time to advise us what to visit in town and his advice was wise. His children are delightful. Excellent for couples or LGBT visitors. I recommend! :-D\"",,,,
13865867,98542545,2016-08-31,87515705,Travis,"Jeff and his family were extremely nice and very accommodating. They let us check-in at 1:45, even though the official check-in wasn't until 3. Jeff also gave us a ride into the city the next morning, even though he didn't have to. He also let us keep our luggage at the house even though checkout was at 11, while we waited until it was time to head to the airport. Both Jeff and his husband were very knowledgeable about the area and were able to recommend some good eats and fun things to do. If my boyfriend and I decide to move to JP, we could definitely see ourselves being friends with Jeff and his husband."

8753559,54929494,2015-11-25,6079413,Lukas,"Rachael and Sergiusz have a beautiful apartment in Brighton (the lovely wooden floor looks even better than in the photos).  The place is spacious, super clean and well connected with the centre of Boston, which already makes it a perfect place to stay. However, the most important thing is that the hosts themselves have extensive travelling/airbnb experience and they act so as they would like to be treated as guests and so the whole experience is a pure pleasure! They are extremely friendly and respectful, always ready to help and with great (international) sense of humour. If only all AirBnB hosts were like this. I can not recommend this place more!"

8753559,64454562,2016-03-04,29816916,Evey,Sergiusz and Rachael were incredible hosts. Their apartment is lovely and they make it feel like home. Sergiusz shared his homemade bread in the morning and they were so kind to share a lot of information about Boston / maps/ metro card with me.

Bathroom is shared and I had no problem with getting in when needed to shower, etc.  They provided and iron/board when I asked.  I forgot my shampoo and Rachel shared hers."
The neighborhood is safe to walk at night,and I took a long walk outside in the evening.   They are 5 min from a bus stop with easy access to downtown Boston,and also a few minutes from other shops,including Thai North,a best of Boston restaurant ( had dinner there both nights).,

Sergio is extremely easy to get ahold of and was an email or text away if we needed anything. The apartment was clean and quaint, and our guest room comfortable and inviting.

Apartment was clean and tidy: kitchen,living room,bedroom,bathroom; all were great.,,
"Recommended for location and host!\"",,,,,
10997047,70667996,2016-04-19,4167411,Andie,Sonia was very easy to communicate with and checked in via text several times over the weekend. She was very helpful in answering any questions that we had. Her place is in a great location - within walking distance of many restaurants and destinations.
10997047,72756619,2016-05-04,12618920,Nicole,"Humble location, perfect location, everything as described.  Recommended host, will definitely stay again."
10997047,75719111,2016-05-22,40232771,Anthony,Sonia made the three of us feel welcome by keeping things simple.  She communicated effectively so I had no worries about arrival.  When we arrived the place had been cleaned.  The shower has great water pressure.  We didn't cook but there was ample cookware had we decided to.
The location is really ideal.  You're a short walk from the Blue Line (airport),embedded in the heart of Little Italy...,,,,
It is a garden level apartment which does mean you can hear people come and go in the evenings,and the building does have young tenants who do,in fact,come and go.  This wasn't a big deal for me,I used a white noise app on my phone during bedtime.  If you are a light sleeper,I could see this being problematic.
"Overall we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again.  \"",,,,,
10997047,76351598,2016-05-26,1684961,Nicole,"Such a great location. You could not ask for better - right in the middle of a great, friendly (very touristy) area (be prepared for crowds to walk past the door). We even had the problem of having our car, and managed to find on street parking for free a couple of blocks away. We loved the neighborhood and ate well. The apartment is not big, and this is one of the old-school airbnbs - clearly someone's actual home. But Sonia has cleared enough space to unpack. The place is not perfectly quiet - you can hear your neighbors, but sound machines worked fine. It was a little cramped for 4 people, but the location makes up for it. Sonia is aware of our only complaint, and is taking steps to fix it - she has a fancy coffee maker - a special Keurig. So we arrived with coffee that we couldn't use, but gamely went searching for keurig cups, only to find we couldn't use those either - her machine takes a pod you buy in specialty stores or on-line. She ordered some for the next guests - but we were left with 4 coffee drinkers having to buy coffee out - which added quite an expense to the airbnb experience (one of the reasons to HAVE an airbnb is to save money on coffee, meals, etc). That was our only frustration, and I think Sonia will make sure it doesn't happen again."
10997047,77657108,2016-06-02,9518150,Summer,"Sonia's place was absolutely perfect for our stay in Boston. The location was spot-on, and my husband, my two small children, and I were all more than comfortable. I would definitely stay again!"
10997047,78891129,2016-06-09,68315949,Jason,I was looking for an affordable and conveniently located apartment that could easily accommodate 2 people as did not intend on spending much time inside - Expectations Exceeded!
Sonia's apartment is like described,the best location in Boston,"and she is extremely accommodating and congenial.  I highly recommend this place and host!\"",,,
10997047,79634680,2016-06-13,69407088,Alissa,"\"Sonia was very helpful with finding the place and letting us drop off bags a little earlier than check in when we landed from our flight. The location of this place cannot be beat! But you should know it's a basement unit and the ceilings are probably only about 6.5 feet high, so if you are really tall this is probably not the best place for you. My friend and I are both 5'6\"\" so it was totally fine for us. Cute little place and we had a great stay. \""
10997047,80316957,2016-06-17,11158233,Jessica,Perfect location and lovely apartment. Just what we hoped for! Thank you!
10997047,81314098,2016-06-22,17849257,Will,"Sonia was a wonderful host, very communicative and inviting. She shared some helpful tidbits before arriving, which made it easy when we did arrive. The place is in a perfect location in North End right outside Old North Church. It's within walking distance to quite a bit. I would definitely recommend this place to friends. Thanks again Sonia!"
10997047,83524371,2016-07-03,12269435,Megan,"This apartment has a great location, right on the Freedom Trail. It's a small garden (basement) place with basic amenities. No air conditioning in the heat of the summer, otherwise comfortable but not stylish for our family of three."
10997047,85900898,2016-07-13,28571438,Tommie,A great location for the north end! A very short door to get in from the street. Only bumped my head once.  No air conditioning.  Most days that was okay but some days it was hot.  Please provide a couple of fans.  No regular tv. Wanted to watch news.  Apartment completely  adequate in other respects. Not real close to the T. About a mile walk.  Not bad for me but I walk a lot.
10997047,87894577,2016-07-22,7719766,Mark,"I unfortunately didn't get a chance to meet Sonia. She was battling a severe health issue. Even through it all, she communicated with me and my friends and with the guest staying before us. She coordinated everything with great professionalism and we were allowed to leave our bags ahead of our check-in. The weather also got very hot and Sonia even got an air conditioner and had it installed right away while we were out. She is an amazing host! The place was very clean and very convenient. Located not too far from downtown only a 5-7 minute walk. I would highly recommend staying with Sonia!"
10997047,88517507,2016-07-24,73768397,Rachel,"Sonia was beyond accommodating. She was quick to respond to my text messages and provided on the spot help as needed. The location of her apartment is beyond amazing. You literally walk out and there is the North Church!  Perfect location to access anything you could possibly want to see.  The apartment is a basement apartment and the ceilings are low, but my husband who is 6'3 had no problem with the height.  We slept 3 of us comfortably between the bedroom and the futon.  A bit of advice, the window unit in the bedroom runs the air for the whole apartment, so if you shut the door to the bedroom at night, your friend on the futon will burn up! Absolutely loved staying here and would stay here again!"
10997047,89839906,2016-07-30,44392954,Cher,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting Boston! The apartment was very clean and in an excellent location, close to restaurants, public transportation, and more."
10997047,90883481,2016-08-02,404400,Patricia,"Sonia was there to greet us when we arrived and showed us around the apartment (how to use washer & dryer etc.). She made us feel welcome & let us know that if there was anything we needed during our stay to contact her,"
10997047,93009038,2016-08-11,46463395,Stefano,All right with Sonia's place. Situated in a calm neighborhood with all the services you may need very near. Maybe a bit small for 4 people if you want to stay everyday at home for lunch and dinner.
10997047,94338925,2016-08-15,77683590,Michael,Awesome location! Had an awesome time and would gladly stay again!
5447285,77295863,2016-05-31,74705197,Qihao,The host are very welcome and lovely. I like to stay here just like stay at home. The host is a great chef and I enjoy her food very much. The neighbors are very kind as well.
7280665,41122517,2015-08-04,37944196,Ricardo,"Great experience. Got my key quickly, the room was what I expected and it had all the amenities needed. Was a great stay!"
7280665,59134594,2016-01-07,46261911,Jaewook,I really enjoyed staying this place. I could meet a lot of kind Indian people.
2649521,13194914,2014-05-21,15143242,Linda,"Our family (5 people and 3 generations) stayed in this lovely condo while visiting Boston for our son's college graduation.  It provided a fantastic home base for all of our activities - close to the airport, close to the T (public transportation) and close to the highways.  Also close to a great grocery store and restaurants."
We had plenty of room inside for everyone to gather together,and to spread out and sleep.  Having 3 bathrooms,two bedrooms and the huge and comfy downstairs area made it comfortable for everyone.,,,
Our hosts thought of everything and Sean was extremely responsive,communicative and accommodating.  They gave us information and instructions for everything and even a great restaurant recommendation that our whole group enjoyed.  Plus they left wine,coffee and chocolate for us -- really what more could you ask?  We found everything we needed in the kitchen and the rest of the home.,,,
I think we enjoyed our stay much more than we would have in separate hotel rooms.  It was really special to be able to gather in a home for dessert together after graduation and dinner.  Our hosts' hospitality shone through and we had all the comforts of home.,,,,,
The home itself is new and fresh inside with quality appliances and furnishings and a very peaceful feeling.  Very clean,well lit,"good wireless access - overall everything we needed for a great stay!\"",,,
2649521,13515066,2014-05-29,2958993,K.,"First things first—what a wonderful place to stay!  Sean's home has everything that might be needed and then some.  The home is very nice, super clean, well maintained and in a superb location...we had not stayed in south Boston before, but now we are so glad we did!  We loved the unique neighborhood feel, with access to everything downtown Boston (yet quiet at night)."
We stayed over Memorial Day for a five day convention and it was important that we could walk to the BCEC as well as to the T.  It is an easy walk to both and it took under 10 min to the T with our small children; a bonus when exploring the sites on foot throughout Boston with kids.,,,,,
With two children,we utilized the condo a lot for eating in,daily naps,watching cartoons,playing games,taking excursions to the playground and other nearby things.  That's one of the main reasons we choose to stay at Sean's condo—to make our trip more like a home stay experience and keep the kids and us sane!  The amenities at the condo were great and I even managed to watch a few hockey games on TV too.
The kitchen had all the necessaries,the bedrooms had comfortable beds (Sean also had a crib for our youngest),three full bathrooms (we only needed two of them) and plenty of living space.  We had more than enough room for whatever we wanted to do.  If we had rented a car,their parking space would have been a huge bonus.,,
As a side note,there is another condo above theirs and we did hear a lot of movement going on during the day (it was also Memorial Day weekend),but it really wasn't bothersome to us at all,or for our napping kids (it would be simple enough to just go to the basement for total silence).  When evening came it was quiet upstairs.,,
Something I really appreciated was the FAQ documents that Sean e-mailed us before we left.  It described all we needed to know about the condo,directions to numerous places/airport,emergency info/important phone numbers,dining suggestions,etc.  He also had a duplicate print out in a binder at the condo—we used it often and it saved me a bunch of time.  My questions were all answered so well that subsequently,we didn't even get to know Sean
Having traveled extensively and stayed in all types of accommodations,"I can highly recommend staying at this condo.  I would happily book again!  The condo is as Sean describes and is the type of place that makes Airbnb a go to resource.  We had a fantastic stay.\"",,,,
2649521,14019780,2014-06-10,13665939,Mark,This Southie Condo was just perfect for our family.  Location provided easy access to public transportation as well as having the option to park a car in their reserved space.  All of the appliances are of high quality including TV's.  Beds and linens were super comfy. The owner's attention to detail is evident throughout.  Communication was prompt and appropriate.    We couldn't be happier!
2649521,17150007,2014-08-08,16154185,Lurdes,"I went to Boston to attend a conference, but also to spend some time with family members who were joining me from overseas. Sean provided detailed information about his place and places nearby that greatly facilitated our visit. He was a great host! If we had a question, we could send him a message and trust that it would be answered almost immediately [if not immediately!]. His condo had ample space (more than I could imagine from reviewing the online photos) and so the five of us were all well accommodated.  His condo sits in a quiet location and it is very close to a metro station as well as a little grocery store that we loved! His place offers an extension of home while you are away from your own home -- a great place!"
2649521,27638105,2015-03-09,9591603,Jeanette,My Husband and I and two couples traveling with us had a wonderful stay at Sean's condo. Everything was seamless. Sean made us feel at home and answered all of our questions quickly. Before arrival I received an email with a welcome packet full of information which was very useful.
"There was more than enough space for all of us! The condo is beautiful and the location is convenient to BCEC. The Broadway stop on the red line is a few blocks away for easy access to downtown. The neighborhood is safe and very quiet. There is a grocery store and other shops and restaurants nearby. Would love to stay again next time we are in Boston. \"",,,,,
2649521,32508347,2015-05-19,29465375,Maria,"The description of the house was exactly like the listing.  The house was roomy for 6 adults.  The kitchen had everything we needed.  The host left a detail notebook on everything we needed to know about the house, local restaurants, grocery stores and a map to the convention center.  We chose this property because of its proximity to the convention center.  We were attending my sons college graduation and we did not want to mess with traffic on a weekday morning.  The subway station was close and downtown was 2 stops away.  The house was very comfortable and felt like home."
2649521,50203542,2015-10-10,25346739,Elizabeth,Sean was GREAT with communication and information. He was Extremely accommodating when my colleagues had some miscommunication and one of them showed up a day early. One of the best experiences I have had as a guest with AirBnb.
2649521,89117269,2016-07-26,61801691,Heather,"Sean was a great host, he responded very quickly to any questions I had about the unit. He was also able to send someone out to clean the unit in the middle of our stay on short notice which I really appreciated. The unit was just like the photos and we loved that they had a Nintendo 64!"
8417742,53937239,2015-11-14,35921898,Rhiannon,"I loved my stay. The place was clean, quite and beautiful. The other guests were quite and respectful. I was there for work and asked Todd to provide an iron and ironing board and he was very accommodating. I told Todd that the room seemed unusually hot and he jumped right in a fix."

Todd was very responsive to communications and the room/house had everything I needed (towels, toothpaste/mouthwash, laundry, iron/ironing board, coffee, and more). Great place, I would stay there again and recommend it to a friend!"
8417742,56440523,2015-12-13,47265693,Hani,That's really great home everything easily can found it quite home with best neighborhood

8417742,77354883,2016-05-31,20192406,Anna,"I stayed almost five months at Todd's place during which I had family and friends coming over and staying there as well. Everything at the house is well thought out, clean and comfortable. Todd keeps improving furnishing and equipment all the time and takes care of everything immediately. I met some awesome people from all over the world during my stay -  the place truly became a second home. Six stars for Todd!"
8417742,79007414,2016-06-10,37146471,Trang Anh,I love Todd's place. It is very cozy and neat. The common area is spacious and well decorated. I feel safe walking in the neighborhood at night and the place is within walking distance to a lot of nice restaurants.
8417742,80659413,2016-06-19,18965331,Carlos Victor,"This was my first Airbn experience, and, thanks to Todd, was a really good one. The place is fantastic, it feels like a five-star Airbn, according to more experience guests I met. It´s brand new, comfortable and spacious. The kitchen is great and the bathroom is packed with amenities. Todd is a very attentive, responsive host, always willing to help. I highly recommend this place if you don´t have much problem regarding location, or if you have a car."
8417742,94681596,2016-08-16,80913598,Mary Ann,"Our visit to Todd's Airbnb was awesome! The large spacious home allowed for plenty of space for all the guests. Everyone was very quiet and respectful of each other. Our queen sized bed was comfortable and lovely with soft, clean linens. The home was very clean and freshly decorated. We enjoyed coffee each morning in the well-equipped kitchen and even spent a morning sitting on the back deck/porch. The neighborhood was safe and quiet. We walked or ubered quickly to most places. We'd love to stay at Todd's Airbnb again!"
8417742,95345980,2016-08-19,40819297,Nikola,"This is a wonderful place to stay, whether for a few days or long-term.  Spacious living room, decks out front and back, back-yard access, a quiet street.  It's beautifully designed and recently renovated.  It's been fun interacting with other guests (but there is a lot of privacy also).  It's spotlessly clean.  The host is helpful and responsive."
8417742,95985765,2016-08-21,6201184,Jennifer,"Desk, night stands, and duvet were almost identical to my own so it felt just like home - haha. Loved the windows, walk-in closet, and comfy bed."

She was there when I checked in, and showed me everything I needed in the apartment. The location was great!! Right next door to Old North Church, and in the heart of Little Italy. It was a convenient walking distance to everything we wanted to do, and the Freedom trail was right next to us. The apt is up on the 5th floor, there is no elevator. There is not a lot of space to relax in the apartment, but that was perfect for us. We stayed out and about most of the time, and were only there to sleep. This place was exactly what we were looking for!"
14282764,92852903,2016-08-10,19703691,Luis,Paulina was always reachable and communicative
14282764,93358576,2016-08-12,8335445,Enrico,Paulina was a very kind host and we managed to work around eachother schedule in order to collect the keys.
The apartment is located right in the middle of the freedom trail making it a very attractive spot. It's surrounded by cafes and bakeries. The flat is located on the 5th floor with no elevator of an old not well kept building. The carpets on the stairs are very dirty and there are several smells coming up the stairs.,,,,,
"Paulina's apartment is old but she tried to make it as comfrortable as possible. We had issues with airconditioning that was not properly workig and very loud due to an old equipment.\"",,,,,

496022,7682836,2013-09-29,3582605,Shawn,"Maria's home was lovely and we definitely enjoyed our stay.  A very nice aspect was the private bathroom and the breakfast items that were made available to us during our stay.....very nice.  Freddie the cat is a sweetie!  Also, be advised if you have problems with stairs, the guest room is on the third floor of the home (not unusual for an older home in this area), but just wanted to say this for situational awareness.  We very much enjoyed our stay with Maria and her family."
496022,16805679,2014-08-02,16159100,Noushad,"Maria was a great host. She was very kind and understanding and gave good tips about JP and Boston in general. She, her children, and her cat Frankie were very welcoming. The room itself was clean, cozy and well furnished, as was the large private bathroom. She was very accommodating of our needs. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful--lots of large, old houses and tree-lined streets, a lovely place to unwind away from the hustle and bustle of the city but is still not too far from it. The house is a little far from the nearest T stop (about a 15 minute walk), but other than that, our stay here was great. If I came to Boston again, I would definitely stay with her and I would also recommend her place to anyone."
496022,19498832,2014-09-13,1343952,Ivy,"I had a great time staying at Maria's place. We didn't seen each other too much because I was too busy at work, but the top floor room is perfect for me, I can do my work and have %100 privacy. Maria is very friendly, she kept space for me in the fridge. My work is really stressful but I'm glad I had such a nice room to stay after a long long day."
496022,21388771,2014-10-16,4109457,Rae Anne,We thoroughly enjoyed staying with Maria!  The top floor was very comfortable and private.  Jamaica Plain Lake was super close and a perfect place for morning runs.  She provided us with everything we needed to enjoy our stay - even got to play guitar a bit while there! ;-)
496022,21723242,2014-10-22,22247556,Jie,We had excellent experience in Boston. The bedroom is very clean and comfortable. Maria is super nice and offers us much help. I fully recommend this homestay.

496022,36754945,2015-07-01,23920650,Utku,"I stayed with Maria for a month and I felt myself at home. The room and bathroom are quite big and comfortable. She let me to use her cellar for storing my bicycle and using her tools for assembling it, as well as using her air pump to inflate the tires. The neighborhood is quite and beautiful. The place is closed to Jamaica Pond and Arnold Arboretum. You can find everything you need on Centre street which is the main street of this area. 5 min walk to bus station and it takes 20 min to Longwood medical area."
496022,38503329,2015-07-16,21363520,Kevin,This was my first AirB&B experience. Jamaica Plain was a great place to start each day and the Boston transit system works well with Maria's house. The third floor accommodations worked well and felt comfortable for my two boys.
496022,41469602,2015-08-07,39431898,Lisa,I had a great stay at Maria's! The house is beautiful and in a quiet neighborhood full of gardens and wildlife which made me feel at home in such a big city. It was located just 15-20 minutes from the training I was attending and I couldn't have hoped for better accommodations. My room on the third floor provided comfortable solitude and respite after my long days in class.
496022,56585646,2015-12-15,189243,Jo,"I had a very lovely and  comfortable room with plenty of space. Jamaica plain is a great place to stay and there is easy access into the city, local shops and Jamaica Pond is just down the road."
Maria is a fantastic host and I absolutely loved staying in her home.  You arrive a stranger,"leave as a friend.  Many thanks Maria!\"",,,,
496022,70776747,2016-04-20,65592942,Holly,Maria welcomed me upon my arrival. She accompanied me to the third floor accommodations which consisted of a private bedroom (queen bed) and bath.  The room was quite spacious with a wardrobe for clothes and a comfy bed.  The bath had a great walk-in shower and plenty of room for all your toiletries. I was visiting family so left early each morning and returned for bed each night. Maria was a gracious host checking to make sure everything was ok.
496022,75204039,2016-05-19,67630816,Tom,This was our first AirBnB experience and Maria made it excellent. Her home was lovely and we were welcomed warmly by both her and her son (not to mention a friendly kitty).  A nice touch was the lindor on our pillows. We had a bathroom to ourselves which made things easier and so we didn't feel in the way of the family's day to day business. Overall a great introduction to the air bnb world and thanks to Maria for providing a great stay.
496022,76206147,2016-05-25,65416329,Patty,"Maria is a very gracious host.  She welcomed us in her home, showed us where to find things around the house,  and showed us which shops and restaurants in the neighborhood are reasonably priced and worth going to.    Her house is cozy, very clean, and located in a quiet neighborhood.  The bedroom and private bath are spacious, very clean, and comfortable."
The house is about a 15-minute walk to the nearest station,at a nice leisurely pace.  It would have been a problem upon arrival and departure since Boston was the last leg of our trip and my husband and I were lugging around 2 pieces of heavy luggage each.  We were planning to take a cab but Maria went the extra mile by picking us up at the station and driving us back for our flight home.,,,,
"Definitely a place we look forward to going back to!\"",,,,,
496022,82178427,2016-06-26,7572929,Henning,We had a great time at Maria's place. We stayed for almost four weeks and enjoyed our stay very much. Maria is a great host. Always helpful and friendly. She was always open for a chat and happy to share things.
The room is very nice with a comfortable bed,closet,air conditioning and a small desk. To have our private bath was very nice. So it almost felt as if we had our own apartment.,,,
The house is located in a very quiet street,but close to Center Street with bars,restaurants and small shops. There is even a pond and park around the corner. By bus it is easy to reach Boston city center.,,,
So I can just recommend this place! Thanks Maria!,,,,,

Her condo is exactally as in the pictures even better in real,well equiped,everything u need is avialable in the condo. It has great location in the Newburry st. Which is the  Champs-Élysées of boston  and the bolyston st. Where you can found plenty of resturants and markets. It is also near the Hynes convention centre ~ 2 min walk and The  T . Green line is just under the building.,,,
There is 24 hours security and the outside door need proxy card to open it,so very safe building .,,,,

I enjoyed staying in her apartment and staying in boston .,,,,,

The apartment is just a minute walk from the Green Line and only minutes from Fenway Park, Back Bay, the South End.. The key pick up and drop off was a breeze, very flexible with my arrival time. His apartment is very cozy, perfect for 1 or 2 people."
The kitchen is fully equipped,clean bathroom,comfortable bed,beautiful interior (Ryan should decorate my apartment!),"and great location - I couldn't recommend Ryan's apartment more highly! \"",

Communication was easy and location was perfect. It is a quite lovely apartment in a safe neighborhood.,,,,,
Ryan’s home is located in a great area,near the orange (Mass. Ave. station) and the green line (Symphony station). Newbury street,the Esplanade and Back Bay are within walking distance.,,,

Bed was comfortable and his Bluetooth speakers are a nice touch! On top of that, his place has a great location, close to prudential center and within a 5min walk to two train stations. We did not need to see Ryan during our stay but he was super reactive whenever we texted him. We recommend this place no question!"
5086521,43969485,2015-08-23,12267352,Joyce,"The listing was exactly as pictured. Clean, comfortable, with everything we needed for our stay."
The location of the apartment is conveniently located in Fenway right by Northeastern - just a few minutes walking  to many coffee shops and convenient stores.  Parking was easy too - it's all resident parking but there are garages nearby and metered parking (2 hour max) across the street. Because we were out and about all day everyday with our car,the metered parking was perfect for us since it was free after 8pm and we paid using the Boston Parking app at 8am the following morning each day.,,,,
The apartment is decorated really cute and there are plenty of drawers for clothes. The air conditioner was a huge plus,and the shower had great water pressure and hot water came fast. It's on the 4th floor but there is a small elevator which is perfect if you are bringing bags.,,,,
"Ryan was prompt with all his responses and overall a great host. We'd definitely recommend his place to friends and would stay here again. \"",,,,,

For the three of us that stayed there, the studio was a perfect size, and we never felt cramped. It's stylishly decorated and we loved Ryan's simplistic and modern style. The photos do a great job of conveying how much natural night there is during the day. Having the studio be on campus was also a huge plus, given that we were only in Boston for 2.5 days and we didn't waste a lot of time walking to and from the T. We would love to stay here again!

Very easily accessible to downtown Boston with a bus stop just a block away (the bus will take you to the train station in 10-15min).
Kathe and her family was so nice,sociable,and open. We had such wonderful time together,and my visit to Boston was just perfect thanks to them. I visited the city for a 3-day job fair,which ended up being a big failure,but Kathe and her mom has been such a great encouragement that I was able to head to the event with fresh mind everyday!! I feel that I have another family in Boston now.
If you are debating whether to give them a try,I wholeheartedly recommend you to do so. I hope you will get to experience the wonderful stay I had with them.,,,,

Kathe had a lot of nice little details to make our stay more enjoyable. The location was fine for us. It was a little farther away from downtown but close to the zoo and Franklin park. Taxi to or from downtown was only $15-20 and we used the bus/metro most of the time. This was my first Airbnb experience and I would certainly recommend it to anyone! Thanks Kathe!

Booking the room was easy, as Kathe kept in constant touch, keeping me informed of all I needed to know. My flight into Boston was very late, and yet Kathe graciously welcomed me into her home. All through my stay of a couple of weeks, Kathe and her family treated me as if I were a family member. So warm and generous they were - every minute of every day. As mentioned, this reservation was my first with Airbnb, and it could not have been with a more wonderful host! Some details: the location of the neighborhood is superb, with a bus to the Red Line only thirty seconds or so from the door. The neighbors are friendly. The house has everything one needs, including a large television and all sorts of media access available. Laundry is right down the stairs, with a modern and efficient washer and dryer - easy to use, even for a lazy person, like me. There was plenty of area in the room for my big pieces of luggage, and the closet space was more than enough for me. Restaurants and shopping are easily accessible by foot or bus, and the kitchen is quite nice for any preparation of food. In the room, Kathe has kindly provided information regarding things to do and places to visit. The bed was comfortable, and I was able to sleep well, every night. The bathroom is squeaky clean, with plenty of hot water. Internet access/speed was great, with no problems, at all. I hope I am not missing anything! In all, I am very glad to have been able to reserve the room. If you are considering booking with her, I urge you to do so, because she is simply a tremendous host!"

176006,2444344,2012-09-29,3210502,Emilia,"I spent an amazing, in a very friendly atmosphere month at Kathe's home. I highly recommend."
176006,2776522,2012-11-01,3422958,Alexander,I stayed with Kathy for almost one month while I was searching for an apartment in Boston.  The time at Kathy's place was a very pleasant experience.  Her family is incredibly friendly and I truly felt at home.  Kathy even helped me to buy furniture!
About the room: it is exactly as described,"and the bed is very comfortable.  I shared the bathroom with Kathy's mother and sister.  \"",,,,
176006,3007119,2012-12-02,3825485,Gilad,I was staying with Kathe and her mother for a month.
It was great time,and they were given my te complet freedom to do and to come whenever I want.,,,,
The house and the room are cushy and they always clean and smell great! Also they demonstrated great hospitality when they invited my to Thanksgiving supper as I was by myself.  they also offered me muffin every once in a while and a a ride to the train station in the morning.,,,,,
To get to the city you will need to take the bus (or to walk to the close T station on a nice day) and then to take the subway. I shouldn't take more then 45 min to get up to MIT- I would suggest to sync with the bus schedule (the trains are much more frequent though- except weekends).,,,,,
The bus station located 1 min walk from the house.,,,,,

176006,5348589,2013-06-25,6655293,Colin,"Kathe was great, very accommodating ... beginning with waiting up for me when my flight got me to her door well after midnight. The room and house were perfect for my needs. Squeaky clean, plenty spacious, and about three miles to my daily destination, UMass Boston (about 10 minutes and $11 by cab). I didn't get a chance to meet her mom, I did say hello to her sister, also very nice, clearly GOOD people. This was also my first AirBNB experience, so I'm glad to report it was a positive one. All good. Thanks Kathe!"
176006,6121302,2013-07-30,7404850,John,"Clean and comfortable. Family was friendly and went above and beyond when we made an odd check-in time request after a red-eye trip in. Only downside was it's not right in the tourist and/or college areas (hence the cheaper price), so if you're taking public transit (which ends early in Boston) you have to end early or take a cab."
176006,6167234,2013-08-01,1728553,Yun,"I spent an amazing, in a very friendly atmosphere 2 nights at Kathe's home. I highly recommend."

Kate et sa maman sont des personnes formidables que j'ai eu l'occasion de rencontrer, elles ne lésine pas à donner la bonne indication ou à assister.

Kathe and her family are very welcoming and friendly, yet you get space and privacy too. Her house is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Public transportation is so close by and easy to use. I would recommend Kathe to anyone."

176006,11086360,2014-03-19,5561662,Adri & Nik,"Hi,"
We stayed at this lovely place and it was very nice,tidy and cozy,they are repainting and updating the room and it seems like they are adding improvements to the house.,,,
We were happy with the place,access to the kitchen and the chocolates I got from Ms Fanny.,,,,
Parking was extremely easy and one could drive to the red line and drop the car arround the area without a worry. If you are a light sleeper you need to know that these are antique houses that sometimes make noise. We are fine with that and loved our stay.,,,,,
"Hosts are sweet and helpfull. We had a great time.\"",,,,,
176006,11165572,2014-03-23,13156974,Anj,"We stayed with Kathe for two nights in Boston and had a very comfortable experience. The room is very cosy and spacious, bathroom very neat and kitchen equipped with all amenities. Boston city centre and Harvard are easily accessible from the house with a train station and bus stop located nearby. Supermarkets and convenience stores are within walking distance or a short car ride away. Kathe welcomed us into her home and made the stay very enjoyable."
176006,11605710,2014-04-08,12797993,Richard,"Kates house was great! She was extremely accommodating and helpful to me at very short notice. Public transportation from the city centre is super easy and the house is very clean and comfortable. Kate and her mother were both amazing hosts, giving me great tips on good things to do in Boston and making me feel very welcome."
I would definitely recommend staying with Kate,"the value is great and you will have a really enjoyable experience for sure! \"",,,,

The bedroom is quite big. It's easy to park your car for free in the neighborhood.

176006,13078988,2014-05-19,1555695,Lisa,"Kathe and her family were very accommodating and the room was exactly what I needed for my brief stay.  They were very gracious and when I had an early morning event to attend in the pouring rain, Kathe's mom was kind enough to drive me there. I would highly recommend them and their place.  I would love to stay here again the next time I'm back in Boston and would tell my friends to do the same.  I wish that I'd had more time to get to know them, but unfortunately my travel plans unexpectedly changed.  Thank you so much for everything Kathe and Fannie!  I loved your hospitality!"
176006,13509989,2014-05-29,14286982,David,Great experience.  Kathe was kind and helpful.

176006,16037010,2014-07-20,17205735,Ariana,Kathe and her family were very nice and the room was very comfortable! There was information about things to do in Boston and she let us know about a free concert going on while we were there. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this listing.
176006,16162479,2014-07-22,13679841,Joyce,"Great place..very clean, comfy bed."
It looked like rain,so they lent us umbrellas!,,,,
Also the water bottles in the room were appreciated.,,,,,
Really short walk to bus stop.,,,,,
"Love to go back sometime\"",,,,,
176006,16620431,2014-07-30,14430993,Jane,"Clean and comfortable.  Kathe very graciously carried my suitcase up the stairs. Very inner-city urban if that's the experience you're looking for.  I'm a city girl and didn't feel at all unsafe, but the neighborhood is a bit noisy with ambulances and such,  and you can hear neighbors very easily with windows open.  You may see a couple guys walking around with alcohol in paper bags.  I didn't have much time to connect with Kathe and her mom, because I arrived in the evening and left in the morning, but they were friendly."
176006,17024986,2014-08-05,12765932,Francois,"Kathe and her mother are very kind and pleasant. Due to traffic delay, they welcome us very lately but still friendly. The room is spacious and clean, as well as the bathroom. Although it is a bit far from downtown, it is possible to use public transportation and they help us to know how to do it. Thank you again !"
176006,17443026,2014-08-12,15510457,Ashling,This place was amazing! Everything was so clean and kathe and fanny were lovely! We had a great time in boston and would def recommend this room to everyone! There are buses and subways to downtown which is great.
176006,17915622,2014-08-18,17414266,Manuel,We had a very pleasant stay within kates house. Her mother welcomed us and answered all our questions. The room and the house were perfect. Very accommodating and clean! We would definitely stay there again. We took a cab back from downtown over night (about 15$) as it can take time to do it by bus during the night.
176006,18081342,2014-08-21,19446453,Victor,The room was clean and the restroom was very clean as well. Their is a bus stop that takes you to Andrew Station about a two-three minute walk. It's good to note that there is no air conditioner in the room and that is something we did not know about. Kathe and her family accommodated us very nicely and made our stay enjoyable. Thank you guys!
176006,19876900,2014-09-20,6686316,Tamara,"Kathe wasn't there when we stayed at the apartment, but her sister and her mother were and they were very lovely and helpful hosts! Our late arrival at midnight was not a problem at all. The room was very cozy and clean. The bathroom was next to our room and also very clean. We enjoyed staying at the place and would definitely recommend it."
176006,20169273,2014-09-24,20148681,Adar,Kathe was most gracious and helpful. Made me feel at home and gavr advice on transportation.
176006,20462823,2014-09-29,11953169,Debbie,"We had a 3 night stay in Boston and found Kathe's place a very good affordable option, with short travel time by taxi into the city centre. The bed was the most comfortable ever and it could have been easy to have a good sleep in!  It was great meeting Kathe's mother Fanny, who was a wonderful host and we had some lovely conversations with her and felt really at home.  Unfortunately we did not meet Kathe who was away travelling.  We had everything we needed (the bottles of water in the bedroom were appreciated).  We didn't explore the local area at all, and spent most of our time in the city.  Thank you for having us to stay."
176006,20923369,2014-10-07,20862159,Angus,"Really nice host and super comfortable bed.  Also very quiet at night.  The place was really clean.  Location was slightly further out than I thought, it was a bus and a train ride to the central city.  Had a great stay there though."
176006,21085982,2014-10-11,12530862,Christine,"Kathe was a really great host and the house was great also. It was clean ,neat and the location was very convenience! Highly recommend people who want to stay in Boston :)"
176006,21679099,2014-10-21,498240,Justin,"Kathe was most helpful answering my many questions about transportation in Boston, and in particular using the bike share programme.  I was welcomed by Kathe's sister and mother during my stay with them.  Both were kind and affable.  The neighbourhood is very residential with restaurants, grocery stores and shopping a good walk: about 15 - 20 minutes.  I preferred to use the bike share system as buses get caught in heavy traffic and there is no close subway line, just a commuter line.  A caveat: the bike share system is somewhat haphazzard and not the most convenient or well placed."
176006,22064997,2014-10-29,21038470,Eric,"We were very well received; the chamber and its description corresponded to the announcement of the website; the host was put in backwards to meet our expectations and our questions. Breakfasts offered and towels changed. Many exchanges on visits made and to do. The host remained very discreet to let us maximum space in the apartment. Use of kitchen, bathroom and wifi. I highly recommend ..."
176006,30045988,2015-04-16,12898447,Jan,Fanny is great person always ready to help. Room and house were very clean. Bus stop is close to house. I am very satisfied.

It was easy to get to their home, using Uber/Taxi. I can only recommend this family and we will stay there again when we return to Boston."

WLAN war uneingeschränkt nutzbar. Fanny ist eine sehr zuvorkommende und freundliche Gastgeberin. Die Lage der Wohnung ist in Ordnung. Es existieren mehrere Anschlüsse per Bus an den T-Stop Andrew Station der Red Line. Nach 10 Minuten Fußmarsch ist man an der Haltestelle \"\"Uphams Corner\"\" der Commuter Rail. In Summe ist man in circa 30 bis 40 Minuten in Boston Downtown. Das Viertel ist sowohl tagsüber als auch nachts ungefährlich. Ich würde jederzeit wieder in dieser Unterkunft hausen.\""
176006,31674632,2015-05-08,32302251,Marie-Louise,La place était vraiment bien! Les photos sont très représentatives et l'endroit était bien propre. Madame Berkeley habite à une 15 de minutes en transport en commun du centre de la ville (ce fait très facilement) et il y a un stationnement disponible dans la rue même pour l'auto. De plus à une distance accessible d'un centre commerciale ou vous trouverez une épicerie! Il est facile de se rendre chez elle. Elle était bien accueillante et très ouverte!

176006,38621039,2015-07-17,2332615,Simon,"Fanny hat uns von Anfang an willkommen geheißen. Wir haben in der Unterkunft alles vorgefunden, was wir benötigt haben. Küche und Kühlschrank durften wir mitbenutzen. Schlafzimmer, Küche und Bad waren sehr sauber."
176006,39419014,2015-07-23,36790892,Anne,"Fanny and Candice were very very nice and welcoming, their house too. The room was exactly as on the pictures, very clean and nice. The bathroom was clean and also looked like the pictures. Nevertheless, if you don't have any car, prepare yourself to wait for the bus for such a long time, and to go Andrew station ( Red line to join the center of the city)  walking ( 30 min). Another thing is the location of the nearest grocery ( stop &shop)  which is also 30 min walking ( quite fast).Also the house is located in the suburb of Boston, what we had not understood and the surroundings is quite poor but safe. Anyway, Fanny is a wonderful woman, it was a real pleasure to talk with her, also she gave us very good advice and let us free to do whatever we wanted into the apartment and she really made us feel home and comfortable !"

176006,41351492,2015-08-07,33554397,Céline,We were welcomed in their home. The bedroom was clean and spacious. They were nice and friendly. They drove us to a supermarket. It is a little far of downtown: we need to take a bus and a subway (20min).
176006,42528700,2015-08-14,29256571,Victor,"We had a very comfortable stay. We only saw Candice the day we arrived. She welcomed us very kindly and showed us the way. The place, however, was far from the city centre and public transportation will take you over an hour to get downtown. We took the cab, which was about 20 minutes and under 20 dollars per ride. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and the bed was really comfortable. Some of the Bostonians we met told us that the neighbourhood was not too safe. We didn't notice any of this but it might be something to consider. In conclusion, the house was perfect but the location was a little bit too far from the city centre."

Es una persona muy simpática y amable, aunque no hablabamos su idioma trato de comunicarse con nosotros en todo momento. La casa y la habitación superlimpia, acogedora y muy comoda en todos los sentidos. Para llegar al centro hay que coger un bus y el metro. El autobus es un poco lento hasta llegar al metro pero sin duda alojarnos con Fanny fue la mejor opcion. Muy recomendable y volveria a su casa si algun dia regreso a Boston."

176006,74748198,2016-05-16,34934872,Elias,Fanny was very nice and welcoming. I liked the neighbourhood too.
The only problem in my opinion is getting around with public transport,mainly the bus connection to get to the nearby subway stations.,,,,
The bus schedule is a bit tricky and sometimes it would take 70 minutes for the next bus (this was around 10pm I think).,,,,,
"Fortunately there's Uber though. Uber worked beautifully for getting in an out of Fanny's place \"",,,,,
176006,91346462,2016-08-05,72754569,César,We were warmly welcomed by Fanny that explained to us everything we needed to know concerning the house and neighbourhood. She gave us keys to come and leave at our will which was very pleasant.

2682662,22780401,2014-11-14,22777847,Michael,"The place was perfect for singles or a couple. The kitchen has everything you could need for basic meals, the apartment is clean and newly remodeled. The obvious highlight is the location, directly on Charles Street, around the corner to the common and public garden. It's a short walk to downtown crossing if you're conducting business and a 30 minute walk across the bridge to Cambridge. The building is quiet, clean, with accessible laundry facilities. Will was quick with his responses. I would highly recommend the place and would welcome the chance to stay there again."
2682662,30648445,2015-04-25,12152966,Cathy,Will asked if he could move me to a (larger) unit in the same building on Charles St to better fit the calendar to my requested dates. I didn't mind as the location was my priority.  Clean unit with new kitchen/bath.  Comfy bed. Managed by short-term rentals so feels less personal but that's okay.  Only downside: older windows are drafty and let in more outside noise (second floor).  Wearing another layer and using earplugs to sleep solve those problems.
2682662,35470891,2015-06-19,17418064,Austin,"This place was in a great location. It was clean and comfortable. Seriously the location is awesome... you can walk everywhere. The unit itself was a little smaller than we expected, but it didn't matter much or detract from the stay."

2682662,43225916,2015-08-18,33409146,Suzanne,What an amazing location! The apartment is right on Charles Street in the middle of the beautiful neighbourhood of Beacon Hill. This was a great base for us to explore Boston - we could walk to most places and the T was easily accessible for when we went further afield.
The apartment itself was clean,modern and fully equipped. There was no traffic noise,despite it being on a main road,and the air conditioning kept the studio cool and comfortable. Check-in was very straightforward.,,

2682662,45391490,2015-09-02,5523418,Mitch,"I really loved my experience here. It was exactly what I wanted. The studio itself was clean, modern, and had everything I needed. Will as a host was perfect - directions were detailed and simple to follow. Really loved the neighborhood too. Lots of great restaurants and shops. Felt very safe. Totally central to all of Boston."
2682662,46684199,2015-09-12,2642405,Mike,"Amazing studio, overlooks Charles St. in the heart of old town. Super efficient layout even big enough to have a couple people over to co-work with. Awesome building as well - one of the few with an elevator!"
2682662,47169584,2015-09-16,40611670,Sandra,"Very nice place at an excellent neighborhood, close to the Boston Common and the T. It was exactly as pictured in the website, cozy and clean. The door code system was easy to use and very convenient. Would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended."
2682662,47364263,2015-09-18,22845418,Anne,Perfect location and space for a quick business trip to Boston!
2682662,48381950,2015-09-26,32431208,Alicia,"I enjoyed my stay at this rental.  The location was perfect.  The unit was clean and it was great for one person.  It was smaller than I expected and might be small for two people.  Street noise was a little noisy from about 10:00-11:30 pm, but not too bad."
2682662,49972700,2015-10-08,6005762,Patricia,"We never met Will, as everything was done via email and the unit had a keypad lock--but all messages were promptly answered, and everything worked, so we were good!  I got a prompt response from the rental manager when I wanted to leave luggage for a bit on the day we checked out, too."
The location was perfect for exploring Boston and we really enjoyed our stay.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.  The street could be a bit noisy at night,"but it wasn't anything that kept us awake--ear plugs might be a good idea if you're sensitive to street noise.\"",,,,
2682662,51445912,2015-10-20,42900802,Pippa,This is such a little gem! Great neighbourhood and so close to everything you'd want to see in Boston. The bed was easy to put away but we didn't always bother because there was enough room to have it out and still move around. Thanks!
2682662,51618931,2015-10-22,28779417,Amir,"Great place to stay in Beacon Hill. We loved the area and were able to walk to different restaurants, Public Garden, and the North End. Very comfortable studio with all the amenities you will need to enjoy your trip. Will certainly stay there again..."
2682662,51904241,2015-10-25,42380729,Michele,"When we arrived we were surprised that the property was identified as the Charles Street Inn.  We were not greeted, it was basically like a hotel.  room was very clean and decorated nicely.  Plenty of kitchen supplies, and nice appliances.  Location was awesome.  Disappointed by the poor cable selection.  Room was warm and we were unable to adjust"
2682662,52840391,2015-11-02,43213710,Ryan,"Will and Naydeesha were very easy to work with. I emailed quite a few times and asked a lot of questions and they got back quickly with answers, which was very much appreciated and helpful. Since the check-in time was in the afternoon and our flight arrived in the morning, we were able to store our luggage in the building's basement, which was very convenient. The apartment was wonderful: dishes, cookware, cutlery available, all made it easy to make a meal; the apartment itself was very clean and well designed. The location was perfectly located in Beacon Hill, being so close and walkable to everything we wanted to see. Would definitely stay here again!"
2682662,55354348,2015-12-01,42260764,Barry,Ideal location in Beacon Hill within yards of restaurants and shops. Very comfortable and well-appointed studio apartment. Good value for money.
2682662,57759166,2015-12-29,40385971,Megan,"Great location, exactly as pictured, and perfect for a young couple! To give you an idea of how centrally located it is...we stepped out one morning and ran by the Charles River, through the city, and finished with a beer at Cheers around the corner. From the apt, we were able to walk to a musical, walk to a Celtics game and have drinks at a great bar across the street from the apt between. Whole Foods, a local market and liquor stores all within a short walk. Ideal spot on a beautifully historic street!"
2682662,71523538,2016-04-25,28003582,Michele And Denny,"The studio apartment is located in a great Beacon Hill neighborhood on Charles Street right in the middle of everything one could want and very walk-able to all kinds of attractions, shops and restaurants."

2682662,85495373,2016-07-11,5090728,Katia,"It is important to know that this listing (and other apartments in the building) is managed by a group called 'Short Term Rentals Boston'. Although clean, secure and in a great location, this apartment is not for those seeking an authentic Airbnb experience. Unlike all other Airbnb accommodation that I have rented, there is no coffee, tea or bath/shower products provided. You are expected to strip the bed upon check out and leave promptly before 11am or pay a minimum fine of $100. It was disappointing that this information was only provided to us after we had paid. The towels in our room were also quite thin and small and the airconditioning unit was constantly dripping. A bit of a disappointing stay!"

6059968,30744468,2015-04-26,31694259,Mindy,"Jason was great! He was kind enough to pick me up from the airport, give me a tour of the neighborhood, and gave me OJ for the morning! If you're looking for a place to stay for a few days I would highly recommend this spot. The place was clean and easy to get to and from the T to get into downtown and Cambridge. Bed was comfortable and set up so you get your privacy. Great price for the value. Would definitely stay here again."
6059968,31280864,2015-05-03,32435896,Dusko,Jason was fantastic and his place is great! We had a pretty strange request: to come over to his place and watch a sporting event that we couldn't get at our hotel. He was more than helpful and extremely friendly. Clean place with a great TV.
6059968,32299994,2015-05-16,18937830,Peter,Beautiful location and neighborhood.  Jason does a wonderful job of making this a warm and friendly place to stay.  Quick and easy access to the T....10 mins into Boston.  I  will go back anytime when I'm back in Boston.
6059968,33625041,2015-05-30,33962701,Stavros,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was everything I hoped for and more. The house was easy to find, in a nice neighborhood, clean and welcoming. Jason was the perfect host. He was very communicative and more than helpful. I can highly recommend staying at his place."
Jason,"thanks so much for getting me in at the last minute.\"",,,,

6059968,37874623,2015-07-11,33417399,Clint,"I highly recommend Jason's condo in Jamaica Plain. Jason is a great host: kind, considerate, and communicative. The condo is very pleasant.  He makes his bike available too, which is great because Boston is so bikeable. Jamaica Plain is a leafy, pretty, and hipster kind of area with a nice village feel. From Jason's you can walk to cafes, restaurants, and parks. Great access to the subway system as well. The alcove is a twin bed."
6059968,43695778,2015-08-21,15207726,Suze,"The experience of staying Jason's house was great. The house was clean, and the location is close to the metro station, only 7 minutes far away. Jason was very friendly, he gave a lot of idea about the city, I am also very appreciate him come to the airport pick me up when my flight arrived at late night. I think I will glad to recommend Jason's place."
6059968,44723601,2015-08-28,40158784,Joe,It was great experience.  It was the first time I used the service and Jason was great!  His place is SUPER clean and centrally located :0)
6059968,45440269,2015-09-02,3518139,Gerth,"I had a great time staying at Jason's place. His home is clean and tidy and very welcoming. Jason is friendly and very helpful. I booked last minute with him and when I needed to stay one more night there was no problem. His place is just minutes away from the subway stop, restaurants, cafes, ice cream places and parks."
6059968,53095570,2015-11-04,46710292,Taylor,Hi is great and very flexiable.
5182313,27909448,2015-03-14,20719648,Victoria,"Adam and Rachel were lovely hosts. Their house is an easy walk from the T (Orange Line) at Stony Brook. They were very welcoming. When I arrived, there was even a fresh towel and washcloth on my bed for me. The room is small but totally adequate, and the full-length mirror helps with getting dressed. A framed map of the Boston T in their living room is helpful if you want to know how to get to Copley, and the map-of-the-world shower curtain in their bathroom is helpful if you want to know what countries neighbor Kyrgyzstan. Breakfast was delicious--pumpkin bread with chocolate chips. (Though they also offered more healthful options like yogurt with homemade granola or eggs any style.) Over all, a great stay!"
5182313,29945194,2015-04-14,21381421,MacKenzie,Adam and Rachel were incredible hosts. We arrived exhausted and stressed out after our travels (lots of silly mix ups!) and immediately felt comfortable and at home. Adam made us a delicious lunch and then let us nap our travels off. He and Rachel were so sweet and did everything possible to make us comfortable. They provided great knowledge of the neighborhood and were also super helpful with letting us know how to get around. Wish we had more time to hang out with them as we had chosen them specifically because they seemed so interesting and cool! But I'm sure we'll be back in Boston soon.
Definitely stay with Adam and Rachel if you're considering it. They're laid back,intelligent and accommodating. Plus Lucy is the cutest pup ever!!!,,,,
"The room is exactly as it's pictured and explained and felt close to home by the end of our stay. The desk is absolutely gorgeous! And the house is conveniently located near a T station. Great first experience for sure :D Thanks Adam and Rachel! \"",,,,,
5182313,30230934,2015-04-19,21501930,Kelly,"My boyfriend and I had an absolutely fantastic time staying at Adam and Rachel's apartment. Adam truly went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable and welcoming as possible! Their apartment is beautifully decorated and spacious, and our bedroom was very clean and cozy (the bed itself was SO comfortable!). Whenever it was convenient, Adam graciously offered to give us rides to our events in Boston, which helped us save money on taxi fares (a big help!). He also made us a very delicious breakfast of french toast and bacon with fresh squeezed OJ (that he squeezed himself!). They have a gorgeous piano and the cutest dog, who we really enjoyed playing with. Adam was also so helpful in giving us advice about moving to Boston too. Overall, this was a GREAT airbnb experience, and it was such a treat staying in a really interesting neighborhood of Boston with a great host! We will most definitely be back to Boston in the future, and will surely stay with them again if possible"
5182313,30400669,2015-04-21,8145273,Abigail,"Adam and Rachel are so easy to talk to and extremely flexible with check in/check out times. They communicated through texts so effectively and helped us tremendously preparing for the Marathon in Boston. They have extensive knowledge of the city's layout (and hard to say Boston names) and even a map of the subway system right in their kitchen for reference. They welcomed us at the door, had snacks, and even made breakfast for us."
5182313,30486144,2015-04-22,5723041,Alex,"Adam and Rachel are great hosts, super nice friendly people, and very generous. When we arrived later in the evening they had delicious hot chocolate for us. In the morning we had a few different breakfast options including farm fresh eggs from a friend of theirs in the country. We definitely opted for the eggs, which were delicious. The apartment itself and room are very comfortable. I highly recommend this as a place to stay in Boston. The neighborhood is beautiful! We really enjoyed just walking around. Thanks Adam and Rachel. Maybe we will see you next year."
5182313,30964046,2015-04-29,486441,Nathan,"A warm, welcoming, charming experience -- I can't say enough about Adam, Rachel and their beautiful apartment. Breakfast was delicious, the bed was perfect, and conversation was the best of all."

5182313,31477040,2015-05-05,6807113,Molly,"My boyfriend Adrian and I were visiting Boston for two days. I got there beforehand and was able to meet Adam and Rachel and their dog Lucy (who is energetic but very sweet). The house is conveniently located about a 5 minute walk from the orange line T station. If you're traveling with a good amount of luggage, I would suggest taking a cab from the airport or train to the house.. I made it with all my luggage but the struggle was real. Other than that, the house was clean, the bed was very comfortable and Adam and Rachel even left out shampoo and soap for us. They are both welcoming and helpful hosts and I certainly recommend staying with them!"
5182313,31978795,2015-05-12,8583276,Hinda,"Adam and Rachel were lovely hosts. Our train arrived late from New York and, rather than have us take the T to Stonybrook, Adam offered to pick us up at the Back Bay Station.  Both were welcoming and the apartment is truly sunny and attractively decorated and clean.   We had tasty breakfasts each morning, often with some home baked goods. If you are a coffee drinker, Adam’s brew is excellent!  We were made to feel very much at home and I even got a chance to practice on their very fine piano.  Conversation with this friendly couple was enjoyable and the neighborhood and convenience to the T are an absolute plus!"
5182313,32216152,2015-05-15,10737168,Andrew,"Adam & Rachel were great hosts and it was a pleasure staying at their place! Their place was simple to find and it was easy getting to & from their place and where I needed to be in Boston/Cambridge. They were generous with their time, and more near & dear to my heart, their food during my stay -- Rachel makes a phenomenal empanada and chicken tortilla soup! Lucy is energetic, super friendly, and easy to be around. Didn't get to jam out on their grand piano, but it's a beautiful centerpiece to their warmly and impressively decorated home. Overall, great experience with great people. Would recommend folks to stay both for the place and the warmth of the hosts. Thanks!"
5182313,32526926,2015-05-19,30361761,Abigail,Adam and Rachel were terrific hosts.  Their sunny and clean apartment was just as advertised.  Parking was easy and street noises were minimal.
5182313,32911202,2015-05-23,15663877,Kathryn,"Adam, Rachel and Lucy (their dog) were very friendly and welcoming when I stayed 4 nights at their apartment. It's as shown in the photos and the bed was comfy - I slept well. I enjoyed sharing some meals with them and chatting over coffee, but you're also free to come and go. They were happy to suggest good local places to dine at or visit while sightseeing Boston. They were very quick to correspond when my flights to Boston were delayed several hours. The neighbourhood is multicultural but I felt safe walking the short walk to the train station. It was convenient to get to Northeastern University and into the city. The Samuel Adam's Brewery is just around the corner. I'd happily stay with Adam and Rachel again, it would feel like going back to stay with friends!"
5182313,33594662,2015-05-30,32058535,Lauren,"Adam and Rachel were warm and welcoming people to stay with in Boston.

They make you feel welcome, generously cook delicious food for you, and have an adorable dog to boot- what's not to like? :) The room is snug and cozy with a nice desk and armchair and the bed is super comfortable.  It's a nice residential neighborhood and very close to the Orange line (takes about 20 minutes to get into downtown Boston). Overall very enjoyable stay and would definitely stay with them again."

It was a real pleasure to stay with Adam and Rachel - they were both extremely kind and laid back, making it extremely easy for us to enjoy our stay. Our hosts were conversational and helpful, while also giving us space and privacy when needed. Their relaxed demeanor made us feel at home - couldn't ask for a better first experience with Airbnb. Last but not least, Rachel made us an absolutely gourmet breakfast the morning we were there - unbelievably thoughtful! Very pleasant stay - absolutely recommend their home. Was a pleasant surprise to discover that we were mere blocks from the T, a HubWay bike station and the Sam Adams Brewery"
5182313,37703936,2015-07-09,37090987,Richard,my stay with Adam and Rachel was entirely positive. They were welcoming and gracious. I especially appreciated Rachel's offer to drive me to the meeting which was the reason for me to be in Boston.

L'appartement est très bien situé,dans un quartier calme et surtout très proche du T.

Rachel n'étant pas là,c'est Adam qui nous a accueilli très gentiment et nous a préparé 2 savoureux petits déjeuners.,,,,

Before we arrived, both Adam and Rachel provided us with directions and helpful tips on getting to their house from the airport. Rachel and their wonderful dog Lucy met us on the street and welcomed my wife and I into their home. She had ice cold glasses of water ready for us while we got settled and relaxed. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room was exactly what we were looking for. We had coffee and fresh baked goods every morning for us before we left on our adventures, which were all incredible. She also served us a cake on one of the evenings that could very easily be sold in a high end bake shop. Adam and Rachel were amazing hosts and we look forward to coming back to Boston!"

The breakfast was amazing, and we really enjoyed the morning coffee (especially me). If you want to visit Boston you have to go in their apartment, it's really nice and they will make you feel like home. :-)"

5182313,49777554,2015-10-06,33100914,Kathryn,We had a great time staying with Adam and Rachel! They were both very friendly and welcoming and their dog Lucy was lovely to have around! Both the room and their apartment were exactly as described and we very much enjoyed having breakfast there with them in the mornings - they are wonderful cooks! We had a fantastic stay in Boston which was definitely helped by the great suggestions that Adam and Rachel gave us to look out for - the local ice cream is an absolute must! We would definitely love to stay with Adam and Rachel again. Thank you!
5182313,52275560,2015-10-27,46634283,Mackenzie,Adam was a very nice host that made sure we had everything we needed. He provided some great suggestions - and Lucy was great too!

Their home was very cozy and clean and we felt right at home. We loved the flexibility we had with check in and check out and that the room had a space heater. Highly recommend their spot to all Boston travelers."
5182313,54796170,2015-11-23,48902002,Connor,Adam and Rachel were fantastic hosts! They were incredibly friendly and we enjoyed swapping a few stories on our one night visit. Their apartment was cozy and clean and a quick walk to the Orange line. On street parking let us leave our car behind for a day downtown. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Thank you Adam and Rachel!
5182313,68557909,2016-04-05,64095276,Teri,Adam and Rachel were such gracious hosts. Provided awesome must sees and gave honest input on typical tourist traps.

They are wonderful cooks who do seem to enjoy hosting and sharing, and though I was only there for one night, I think I will remember their hospitality and kindness for a long time.  I would love to stay there again.  (And yes, Lucy is a sweetie!)"

5182313,74367220,2016-05-15,70349288,Cara,"Rachel greeted us when we arrived and was there to show us our room and provide the key. Both hosts were very welcoming. They were considerate when making us breakfast and asked if we had any dietary needs. The apartment was cute and you felt right at home. One thing to note is that the place is small but it wasn't a problem for my friend and I since we did not mind sharing and we were gone most of the day. I had mixed feelings about the neighborhood; when I was walking around with my friend I felt comfortable but I might have been nervous walking around alone. The apartment was very conveniently located close to the T and this was perfect for getting in and out of the city. Also, it was very close to the Samuel Adams Brewery which is fun to go to for a tour. Overall staying with them was great!"

They had great recommendations for places around the area and into Boston. The T is easy to navigate and close to their place. The Sam Adam brewery is just a few minute walk away!

I really appreciated that they took time out of their busy schedules to make us breakfast every morning during our stay. Their apartment is in a great location because it is close to a subway station, but also far enough away from the congestion so parking is very easy. The room is perfect for a single person or a couple."

Lucy their pup was gracious and Adam served us all kinds of goodies. Unexpected, but very welcomed! Breakfast on our first day in Boston and later some cherry pie and chocolate croissants! Delicious! Adam went above and beyond as a host; we had very early and late travel iteneraries. We will be back to Boston and most likely will be back at Adam and Rachel's!"
5182313,87045404,2016-07-18,19204984,Ruth,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay at Adam and Rachel's. Very friendly couple and a very welcoming home.

The T is also very close, so it takes you only 15min to get to the city center. Adam is an exceptional host (and a great cook) and Lucy (the dog) made always sure we won't be bored :) We absolutely enjoyed our stay in Boston - also thanks to this great Airbnb."

891953,21835863,2014-10-25,2334325,Fiona,Great location. Very central. Spacious apartment with everything you need.
891953,36774656,2015-07-01,31727785,Gunner,Booked an entire month of june stay here and a week before when I got the reminder confirmation I emailed manager to confirm. She did not get back to me till four days before I was due to arrive and told she made a big mistake and mistakenly thought I was coming in july not june!!!! Then told me she coukd only let me come if I stayed in three different apartments but on june 22 to 26 I had to find another hotel because she had promised it to someone. That week was completely sold out in boston and u could only get a hotel for 500 to 1200 a night!!! When I protested she said well you better take it because she could just Cancel my booking and I would have no place to stay at all!!!! I'm started to Learn that AIR BNB Needs to have more oversight!!! I paid almost 4000.00 for the month and was treated very badly. Then when I got to the condo the televisions were not working. 
I think this was on purpose because she wanted me to leave on june 21 and not come back because she was able to rent the condo out for way more money. ,,,,,
I agreed to find another hotel on june 22 to 26 and kept emailing her that I would be back on the 26 th to check into the other condo she had arranged for me. Then she texts me and says well since u r do u happy here she would give me my money back!! I texted her I WAS NOT UN HAPPY ,,,,,
But I sensed that she was trying to get rid of me so she Coukd get more money !! I was right! When my son came to pick me up she took him aside and had checks written out for the remaining amount of my stay to end of june and from july 1 to 15 which she had agreed on separate from air Bnb reservation. ,,,,,
PROSPECTIVE TENANTS need to be very WARY WHEN BOOKING HERE!! I'm wondering how often this happens especially in the city . Awful experience . And you must walk up and down 49 steps to the third floor apartment which I did not mind because I thought it was good exercise but other people might not like it.,,,,,
Tv in second bedroom never was fixed and the only reason I got the living room tv working was because I spent hours asking friends to help me get it working. ,,,,,
I have all the texts from this disaster and hope that other air Bnb customers do not get treated like this. READ THE REVIEWS and hope for the best I guess but if u going to a city that is booked for conventions u may just be sleeping on the street !!!! ,,,,,

891953,53319983,2015-11-08,24286011,Kaitlin,"We stayed at this rental for three months and the location was great! Its right in the heart of the city and the haymarket stop is a three minute walk from the front door. If someone were coming for the weekend and not staying at the rental for long periods of time this is perfect.  For a long term rental its not the most comfortable. the pull out couch is really worn down and we had to purchase two thick mattress covers to make it sleep-able. Also the TVs dont work, we informed the land manager multiple times of this and transient ant issues in the lower bathroom and each time she was out of town or unavailable.  Overall I would stay here again because the location and the amount of room you have is incomparable. Also the price was hard to beat."

The house looked clean at our arrival,since we were tourists,we haven't spend much time home,mainly in the evening or night. So,definitely a strategic position!Since the house Windows looks strait on other building walls,there is no much sun light coming through and when in the house the light as to be on constantly

891953,85746935,2016-07-13,48106936,Chris,Really enjoyed my stay here in Boston. The location is absolutely perfect. It's close to T stations as well as in walking distance to many restaurants and activities. The apartment was very well kept and had everything you need. Made a great home from home.
891953,88491362,2016-07-24,48393052,Vivian,"This Airbnb is at a great location, very central and convenient. The apartment itself is very nice, but the amenities are just okay. The bed is a full size, kind of hard, and the sofa bed is not that comfortable as sofa beds go. The AC wasn't working when we got there, which we fixed with new batteries. By the end of the stay (7 days), we had run out of toilet paper in one of the bathrooms and there wasn't any extra toilet paper anywhere. Also the internet stopped working on our last night. Some (non-mandatory) amenities it seemed weird that they were not provided. I.e. dishes but no dishwasher or drying rack, laundry machine and dryer and dryer sheets but no laundry detergent, and a coffee machine and coffee filters and no coffee. I wish I had a little more information prior to the day we got there about how we were going to get into the Airbnb as that seemed last minute/not that well-planned/communicated. Overall great location though."
891953,94357392,2016-08-15,20007746,Kalle,A huge place. Some noise from them bars next door. Also you can't really see out of the windows because the next buildings are so close. Great value anyway.

Eddie arrived on-time to give us the keys and the tour. This split-level basement unit is freshly painted, with attractive new furniture. There are loads of clean white towels and the space easily accommodated ourselves in the bedroom and another adult on the pull-out sofabed in the living room. We were able to park our car (for a fee) at the gas station at the end of the building, which was a relief because the rain was pouring down hard during our stay. Alan was sympathetic, highly responsive and went out of his way to be helpful to us when I raised a concern; he clearly has the happiness of his guests as his top priority."

Very cute and unique. Eddie checked in with us several times to make sure we were doing ok amongst the Boston snow storm and someone came by periodically to make sure the stairs were shoveled.

It has one bed, and with the two sofas it was spacious enough for the three of us.

He was so friendly and helpful, his assistance was much appreciated! :) Great communication with Mr. Allen and with Eddie throughout my experience, from booking my stay, to checking out. The space was perfect for me, easy-peasy walk to the hotel where I was attending a conference, but a fantastic location in all aspects—so close to everything—points of interest, sight seeing, restaurants, shopping, grocery/drug stores, Fenway, if you're in town for a game, etc. The apartment was clean, cozy, well-appointed—full kitchen with dishes, etc., coffee maker, fridge, clean bedding & bath linens, satellite TV, high-speed internet...I'm, sure I'm forgetting something...I was only in town for a few days and didn't have much free time to explore the neighborhood or use the apartment for much more than sleeping, but would definitely stay again, and would recommend the apartment to anyone visiting Boston.

The apartment was as described and the location couldn't have been better for our game at Fenway Park - we were able to walk to the ballpark in less than 5 minutes! The apartment was nicely decorated, the beds were comfortable and everything was very clean. Our only complaint was the noise level, both from the overhead plumbing and from whatever was going on in the hallway outside the apartment. But all in all, it was a lovely stay, close to the T stop as well as shops and restaurants."
4577188,31680275,2015-05-08,5913612,John-Paul,I booked Alan's place on behalf of my parents who were visiting Boston and they enjoyed staying there. Centrally located with lots to do in the area and the place was just as depicted in the photos. Thank you for making my parents feel welcome.

It would be a great location,"if the noise level in the night and in early morning could be reduced.That will be difficult probably with all the piping. But the back door - emergency exit - could and should be better shut off against the noisiness.\"",,,,
4577188,32673857,2015-05-20,12573105,David,"The apartment was lovely. Although it's a basement apartment, there is still plenty of light in the living room. The apartment is quite big and has plenty of room for visitors. Most amazingly is the location. This apartment is a very close walk to the main part of Fenway, Kenmore Square, and Newbury Street. It's also right across from the Fens, which is a lovely place for a walk if you need some fresh air. I highly recommend this place. It is comfortable, convenient, and you will definitely be taken care of."
4577188,32969775,2015-05-24,27900114,Katherine,Thank you Alan and Eddie for your prompt responses and excellent communication.
The location could not get any better for catching a Red Sox game. Fenway was an easy 3 minute walk from the property. Additionally,there were many wonderful restaurants,shops,and public transit within walking distance.,,
The kitchen was well equipped with a small refrigerator,gas stove,microwave,toaster,tea pot and coffee maker. The property is a basement apartment in what we felt was a very safe neighborhood. The locks on the front door could be a little fussy,but were manageable. There also was some type of elevator/lift outside the kitchen wall that made some noise. So
Overall,"we definitely would book this property again. The location absolutely could not be beat!! \"",,,,
4577188,34003106,2015-06-03,31881747,Stuart,"We did not get to meet Alan as he was away on business, but we did meet Eddie, his co-worker, who was very prompt and delightful. We felt quite safe in this neighborhood, and walked wherever we went. The den is spacious, with two couches and a TV. The bedroom was downstairs, and was very adequate. This is an apartment converted from a basement, so there are some exposed pipes in the ceiling but I think it adds to the charm. It is a 10-15 min walk to the Hynes convention center, and less than 5 minutes to FENWAY. The community gardens, with the oldest WWII victory garden still in use, is across the street."
This is an IDEAL place if you want to take in some games at Fenway- my first time there and I found baseball nirvana! Good price,nice location,"delightful people to work with. I would certainly rent here again.\"",,,
4577188,34274472,2015-06-07,27435685,Antonio,"The place is well located; easy access to metro, Fenway, stores and dining . The bed was really comfortable."
4577188,34866209,2015-06-13,23000154,Natalia,This apartment was great! We went to the baseball game and it was so nice being only about a minute walk from the entrance. Alan was very helpful in the check in process which was great because it was our first time using this service. The location was wonderful and around the corner from the ken more t station. Would definitely stay there again!
4577188,35422096,2015-06-18,33763079,Chris,"I stayed at Alan's place with my wife and 2 kids.  The apartment is clean, the furnishings are new and in good shape and everything works as advertised.  It was also large enough to comfortably fit the 4 of us.  Alan was out of town, but Eddie was very responsive to any needs we had, knowledgable about the neighborhood and friendly.  The apartment could not be any closer to Fenway if that's what brings you to town."
4577188,36090512,2015-06-25,30782528,Kam,"Our host was very welcoming and provided insider tips for nearby restaurants, grocery store,and sight seeing attractions.  Our host was very prompt to reply when we needed to contact him. Property was as listed, and very close to Fenway ! It is an older property, but roomy enough and comfortable for 4 adults. Kitchen is a small efficiency kitchen with no dinning room., but there are two couches in the living room to sit on while eating. The Parking in the city (as in other cities) is difficult and because this property is close to Fenway, it is expensive on game days."
4577188,37684371,2015-07-09,36236430,Jenny,"Communication with my host was great. He was very helpful, and flexible as my flight was delayed and I arrived late in the evening. I was attending a Red Sox game while in town, so the location was fantastic for that. A short walk and you are there!"
4577188,38593840,2015-07-17,32054628,Richard,"The location is great, especially if you plan to go to a ballgame or concert at Fenway - it is literally right around the corner. It is also right across the street from victory gardens, which is a nice area to walk through. If you are a day sleeper, you'll want ear plugs. There is a service hall adjacent to the appt and during the day there is activity in there - lots of doors closing. It can get loud sometimes. We did sleep well, the beds were comfortable.  This is a basement appt, which is really nice for luggage. There were lots of places to put your clothes, load up on groceries, it almost made me feel like a local. It did not have a breakfast table, but you should be out enjoying Boston, right? It was about 1/2 mile from three different train stops, which is really nice for getting around the city. I do recommend this location, it is a nice spot for getting around and is a good clean place to stay. The hosts did a great job with communication."
4577188,40970874,2015-08-03,38031599,Baldo,"We stayed at this apartment not so long ago while visiting Boston. Communication with Eddie was good from the beginning, he was really friendly and helpful and waited for us as we were stuck in transit longer than expected. He directed us to main streets and recommended few most attractive places in Boston. The apartment was OK (despite the fact that is actually situated in the basement although we expected higher floor), location is great, only 10 minutes walk from the city centre. However, we were having trouble with a lock as we spent a long time to properly lock/open the front door. Also, we got really scared and had trouble sleeping due to the heavy undefined sound when we thought we are being robbed or there is someone throwing the furniture around! The next day we checked out reviews from people previously stayed there and realized that the annoying sound comes from an old elevator and people were probably moving at that time (during the night?!). I think people should be informed about this issue before booking."
4577188,41366677,2015-08-07,35574407,Heather,"Communication with Alan and Eddie was great, especially with a cancelled flight and later check-in.  The best thing about this apartment is the location.  We only had to walk ten minutes to the nearest T station and a 25 minute walk to Boston University.  Fenway Park is literally in your backyard.  It would be a perfect location for a ball game.  Other reviewers have mentioned the loud banging noise, and we also experienced this noise.  It seems that there is an elevator shaft/old service room next to the kitchen, and it does make a very startling noise.  We had the air conditioner on at night which was able to drown out some of the noise.  The pictures accurately describe the apartment.  There is a fridge and microwave in the kitchen (which is not shown in the pictures).  The other thing it doesn't show is that it is in the basement, but it still has a good amount of light coming in from the windows and is clean and bug-free.  Overall, this location was perfect for us because it was close to where we needed to go in Boston."
4577188,43899441,2015-08-23,28687892,Phil,"Great location, and perfect fit for our family of four (two adults, two kids).  Short walking distance to the Hynes Convention Center made our time in Boston so easy."
Couldn't be more convenient for going to a ball game at Fenway,and even being so close you don't hear game noise at night.  A neighbor at the back of the building has a VERY loud slamming door,but that's the only very minor negative to a great stay.,,,
Easy check-in and friendly host made us feel very welcome on our arrival,"which was a nice bonus.\"",,,,
4577188,46575786,2015-09-12,16651369,Dian,"The location is the best! It's short walking distance to everywhere--Boston University, Fenway, Newbury Street, T-stations (Kenmore or Hynes Convention Centre). It's across of a beautiful park and very safe surroundings."
The apartment is located in the basement so expect you can hear noises from upstairs.  The posted pictures are accurates.,,,,,
Eddie are really helpful,"welcoming and friendly. He can be contacted anytime so I feel secure. The bulb in the bathroom was off  one day and it fixed on the same day.\"",,,,
4577188,47368143,2015-09-18,20450487,Seth,"Had a great time staying in Alan's place! Everything went smoothly as he and his property manager were both extremely responsive to all emails and texts and were flexible and helpful with checking in and getting acclimated. The apartment was exactly as described: great location, great layout with tons of space, great amenities, and extremely clean with fresh linens. Would definitely stay here on my next trip back to Boston. Thanks again Alan!!"
4577188,47712585,2015-09-21,14238936,York,"Apt as described in great location. Alan was responsive and although he had to go out of town at the last minute for business, his manager was easy to get in touch with and very helpful. Overall a great experience and would highly recommend the apt!"
4577188,47978181,2015-09-22,39771057,Eric,"Alan was actually out of town on a business trip when we went to Boston; however, he responded quickly and was very open with his communication. His building manager Eddie was extremely helpful."
The property was great,"in a very ideal location. Eddie provided us with great recommendations for activities and oriented us very well when we arrived. The apartment was very clean and had great amenities. Highly recommended!\"",,,,
4577188,48687771,2015-09-28,32965762,Jennifer,"We had a great stay at Alan's place - it was perfectly located right by Fenway park and we were able to walk to everything we needed and wanted! The place was clean and just perfect for my husband and I. Alan was traveling on business and had his property manager, Eddie check us in. Alan communicated this to us prior to our stay and Eddie emailed us quickly with instructions and his number! Eddie was awesome and helped us find parking and get us situated! He gave great recommendations and directions on everything near by. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Boston!"
4577188,49002812,2015-09-30,5420679,Danielle,Description is accurate -- this is a large basement apartment with very high ceilings....host has made the space as nice as can be expected considering it is a basement apartment.  There is a giant dehumidifier/aircon in the bedroom that did a great job extracting the moisture during my rainy stay.  Location is great -- I was working at Fenway Park and it was a super-easy commute -- also very convenient to Kenmore Square T-stop.  Unit was very clean and host was very responsive and easy to interact with.
4577188,49427941,2015-10-04,4563561,Susan,"Great location for Fenway park, Hynes Convention Center, Newbury street and Berklee. Clean, simple apartment. Kitchen has all the basics. Alan was very easy to work with and quick to respond."
"Beds were fine.\"",,,,,
4577188,49842720,2015-10-06,38697767,Morgane,"Great apartment. Very easy check in and easy communication with hosts. Apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to public transportation. Apartment was very clean and well decorated. As others have mentioned, you can hear the elevator (and maybe also a trash chute) located next to the apartment, but we are deep sleepers so this didn't bother us. Would definitely stay here again."
4577188,50074175,2015-10-09,24765208,Dominique,Alan was very welcoming and our experience was great in Boston.
The apartment was just what we needed,conveniently located,clean and properly equipped.,,,
Would recommend for a short stay in Boston,"a great place to be able to visit/attend events at the Hynes Convention Center.\"",,,,
4577188,50916767,2015-10-16,4466178,Alfonso,"Super clean, confortable basement apartment. 2 blocks away from the nearest T station. Very easy to check-in, good communication with either Alan or Eddie. Highly recommended place to stay in Boston, MA."
4577188,51907305,2015-10-25,7116022,Lesha,Great place to stay for MIT Family Weekend! The bed was super comfortable. I felt very safe in this area and the central location was great!
The apartment was spacious and had so much more character than a hotel.,,,,,
I will definitely consider staying here each time I visit Boston.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4577188,53035070,2015-11-03,35388361,Anne,"We had a lovely stay at Alan's apartment!  My husband and I were in town for a few days and Alan was able to accommodate us on very short notice.  When we arrived, Alan was very flexible in our check-in time which was very helpful.  The apartment was comfortable, centrally located, and right in the heart of a great neighborhood.  Thank you Alan for making this such a seamless and comfortable *short* trip.  We would definitely recommend this apartment for whatever reason you are visiting Boston."
4577188,53456593,2015-11-09,22715294,Zoé,Logement bien situé et exactement comme la description. Tout était parfait durant notre séjour!
4577188,56995340,2015-12-20,51567464,Lindsey,Great place in a fun neighborhood. You can't beat steps away from Fenway Park! The description and pictures are 100% accurate. We enjoyed our first time in Boston and felt very welcomed!
4577188,58197817,2016-01-01,49656107,Alexander,"Alan was very helpful and friendly throughout the booking process, and was kind enough to accommodate me for just a one night stay on New Years Eve. All of my questions were answered quickly and accurately, getting settled in the apartment couldn't have been easier."
4577188,59267952,2016-01-08,43873597,Vidiya,"This was a last minute booking. I was sick but also working in Boston and needed a quiet place to work. Alan and Eddie managed to complete my booking and push the process to let me check in hours after I made the decision to book the place. The place was very room though very different in how it is set up. It is a basement unit, so no real windows and lots of noise from the above apartments. However, super fast internet, all amenities promised available, and great communication from the host! Definitely recommend!"
4577188,59410632,2016-01-10,51752220,Amy,"Thanks to Alan for a great experience this weekend!  Apartment was clean and felt very safe. Location was convenient to so many desirable areas and attractions, including Newbury Street for shopping, the Fens for a nice walk, and both the MFA and Isabella Stewart Gardner museums. And of course, Fenway park. Esplanade also nearby for a run by the Charles River. Highly recommended!"
4577188,61671249,2016-02-07,3013712,Anshuman,Our flights were extremely delayed on account of the winter storm but Alan had arranged to have the apartment available to us. By the time we got in it was past 10 and we didn't have any trouble getting in. The apartment is located within a 10 minute walk of both the Fenway area and BackBay and even with bad weather we were able to explore the area on foot. The apartment is quite spacious and the living room couches are very comfortable. The kitchen is big enough if you decide to indulge in small prep meals.
4577188,63856351,2016-02-27,36490246,Elle,My friends and I had a great time. Alan was a gracious host! He even brought over some wine for my friend's birthday. Cute apartment in the perfect location. I would go back!
4577188,64901120,2016-03-08,33143187,Natalie,"We enjoyed our stay in Alan's apartment, and the entry and exit were really straightforward.  We travelled into downtown Boston for most of our activities, and the transport was easy.  There were a couple of different train lines within 5 or 10 minutes walking distance, and the walk was pleasant.  We walked back at night, and didn't feel threatened."
The apartment itself was clean and warm,and in a good location for the Back Bay area of Boston.  It's a basement apartment,so there's not a lot of natural light.  That didn't matter to us because the whole point of going to Boston was to see Boston,"not the apartment.  I would definitely recommend this listing.\"",,
4577188,66364616,2016-03-22,22851172,Daniel,"Wow! Just wow. The apartment was awesome. The bed was super comfortable for 2 persons and my buddy slept well at the pull out couch as well. The location is awesome. Its really just a few steps away from fenway park as well as from all the shops @ newbury street and the rest of boylston street. The contact to the host was great as well, no problems at any time. I hope to come back soon."
4577188,67560015,2016-03-30,60485768,Mirella,"Alan and Eddie were great hosts! Communicating with them was very easy. Eddie greeted us, showed us the place, and suggested some places to eat around the area. The apartment is very well located, walking distance to Fenway Park, Back Bay, and the Hynes Convention Center station. It is a spacious and comfortable basement unit with its own entrance from the street. We enjoyed staying there since it was close to my son's dorm and we could spend a lot of time together. The bathroom, kitchen, linens, and towels were very clean but the floors and rugs needed a little more cleaning. The memory foam beds and the sofas were very comfortable and there are some folding tables to eat in the living area. The kitchen and bathroom were well equipped with coffee maker, toaster, and microwave oven. We enjoyed the big screen TV and the WiFi on a couple of rainy evenings (the cable TV has only basic channels). One thing to note is that you can hear a lot of the building's noises so if you're a light sleeper bring earplugs. Other than that the place was perfect. Thank you Alan and Eddie for hosting our stay."
4577188,68421949,2016-04-04,17350843,Yutong,Alan was very flexible with our check-in time and his house manager made sure we have everything we needed. We were a bit taken aback by the outside appearance but the interior were same as the pictures. The area is pretty safe and we've walked back from the T
station around midnight multiple times without trouble. The bedroom doesn't get much sunlight so be sure to have an alarm clock on your phone! Overall,"great experience.\"",,,,
4577188,70693652,2016-04-19,22012162,Ellen,The location worked out very well for us since it is within walking distance of many restaurants and the Hynes Convention Center T station. Eddie was very responsive with communications during our check-in process.  We had a very enjoyable time.  Thank you Alan and Eddie for hosting our stay.
4577188,71302819,2016-04-24,14076917,Joe/Aislynn,"We didn't know Boston geography well prior to booking Alan's place, but have to say it is perfectly placed. We had no idea it was across the street from what would be the coolest community garden we've ever seen, a great walk from major shopping and within a block or two of a CVS, a liquor store and a grocery store...not to mention great restaurants. Great, great stay."
4577188,72952580,2016-05-05,22715546,Olaf,Alan en Eddie waren zeer gastvrij en hielpen wanneer nodig.
4577188,73777124,2016-05-10,23569091,Luis,"The property is well located , host was very responsive when we had an issue with the bathroom."
4577188,74822173,2016-05-16,3247088,Megan,"Alan was reachable by email, and kindly extended our stay at the last minute which was appreciated. The location is wonderful, right along the parks in Fenway and very near the ballpark. This is a garden apartment, meaning it is the lower level, and thus it is pretty dark in the apartment-- this was fine for us as we didn't spend any time there except at night. However, keep this in mind when you are looking to stay here if you want to spend much time in the place. The apartment is spacious and clean, but lacks decorations or any sense of home-iness, definitely could be much more cozy with some things on the bare white walls. But, it did the trick for us as a place to rest our head at night. Very squeaky bed too."
4577188,76497001,2016-05-27,55073633,Cheryl,"Eddie met my husband and son at the apartment when they arrived. He gave them a quick tour and shared info on surrounding area. The apartment was basically as shown in pictures and description except there was no tv in the bedroom. Unfortunately I made the reservation so my husband did not know there was supposed to be a tv and  only found out shortly before their trip was over. Once Alan was alerted to no tv in the bedroom he promptly tried to remedy the situation. The apt is very basic, very small kitchen, no table and chairs but tray tables to eat on.  Dave and Travis spent very little time at the apt so this did not matter to them. Bed and sofa sleeper were clean and comfortable. Kitchen is small but had everything they needed to make breakfast and a few meals. Any questions the guys had, Eddie was very quick to respond. The area was perfect. The guys were there to watch the Red Sox play and it was a 5 minute walk to Fenway Park. There are many good restaurants, coffee shops, bars, Target, Star Market and the subway all within a 5-10 minute walk. The guys walked several times to downtown Boston in under an hour. There is also a nice park across the street. The guys both said they would stay at this apt again. Nothing fancy, just a clean, comfortable, nice apt in an excellent location. Thank you Eddie and Alan."
4577188,80636858,2016-06-19,1863703,Elizabeth,"The best thing about the apartment is definitely the great location: it's a short walk to restaurants, the T stop and basic amenities, and the park across the street is lovely. Alan and Eddie were also very pleasant and easy to communicate with."
The downside is that it's a fairly austere basement apartment,with all the cons you'd expect -- it's very dark and very noisy (there are exposed pipes,which means lots of noise from the rest of the building 24/7 -- earplugs are recommended). It's also sparsely decorated and lit,with lots of white walls.,,
That said,it is roomy,in fairly good condition and with all the essentials. Overall,an OK choice if you're looking for a no-frills place to sleep in the area,"but not an inviting place to spend free time.\"",
4577188,83356617,2016-07-02,2936130,Daniel,"Beginning with the positives, the apartment is in a decent location, it's clean and tidy, and the communication from the owner and his team was excellent."
However,we did experience an awful lot of noise in the apartment - more than we would consider reasonable,which spoilt the experience somewhat.  As others have mentioned,the apartment is in the basement and abuts an elevator,the door of which bangs extremely loudly.  One room (the bedroom) is worse than the other; our children slept on the couches and were able to sleep just fine,as was I on the second night.  My wife
All in all,if a basic no-frills place to crash after seeing Boston is what you're looking for,and if you have a reasonable tolerance for noise,"this apartment will do the job.\"",,
4577188,84093381,2016-07-05,80508300,Thor,This place was great. Easy to move in. The place was clean and the AC was flowing which is great in a humid Boston summer. Had no issues during my stay
4577188,86204831,2016-07-15,53637997,Diana,Don't book this place !!! The nightmare began when my Uber driver drop me off close to where the address wasn't. Yes I said wasn't 11 95 does not exist. They purposely give the wrong address you look at other reviews they've done this to other people. Soon you will understand it is in the basement and the littered with constructions guys food which attracts flies right at your front door. When I first got there I open the apartment to find that the apartment wasn't ready it was still in disarray from the previous guest. I had spoken to Alan I mention that I was going to arrive at midnight. But earlier that day I received a call from Kevin his associate and discuss that I was getting on an earlier flight and would be there around 9 he assured me the apartment would be ready. When the Uber driver drop me off close to what was 1195 to only find out that address does not exist I am mediately called and they told me that it was down the street at 1173 and that Airbnb had the address wrong. I know this is not true because I am an Airbnb host and the host sets the address. I think they do it to not scare people away at first sight and/or they have more than one and toggle people around two other apartments from what I've seen in other reviews. When I arrived the apartment was not cleaned they told me to drop my bags and they would have someone there to clean immediately. Kevin called me he said he was on his way to clean the apartment that he was very apologetic about the misunderstanding. I left to have dinner Kevin called me and said this is so unprofessional but I don't have the keys to the apartment can I come and get them from you which he did. I had dinner and within the hour he told me he was done cleaning would I like to get the keys from him I said no I think you should come and bring them to me since I would like to have dessert. He brought me the keys not looking very happy about the situation. I went back to the apartment and noticed he did a minor cleaning maybe just the bathroom and made the bed but other than that I don't think anything else was cleaned. The apartment is very minimally furnished. So if you like that dorm type look this is the place for you the apartment is in the basement with exposed piping on the ceiling and very loud noises coming from both upstairs and the freight elevator that is right by your back door. Lots of loud noises coming from the hallway in the back area almost scary. In the cupboard I found a coffee cup that had the side of it dripping with old coffee. The shower area was less to be desirable...
4577188,92966036,2016-08-10,10814644,Scott,Good location and cost per night were good.  The unit is a basement unit so there was not a lot of natural light.  As some of the other reviews have noted there is some noise tied to the elevator that you get used to.  The unit did have AC which was nice given how hot it can get in Boston and is also close to a few T stations and downtown.
4577188,95434480,2016-08-19,5670654,Kelly,"Very convenient location. Close to Fenway, Boston University, etc. Air conditioning, space is ample for a party of four. The hosts were accessible and accommodating. Easy check in and check out. Overall experience was excellent."
4527029,30638790,2015-04-25,31077720,Mustafa,The host was very pleasant and cordial. The room was clean and exactly as described in the picture. Bed was fairly comfortable. The bathroom was functional but cramped. Kitchen was clean. The refrigerator had ample room and was clean. The place is in a run down part of Boston but seemed okay.
4527029,31072511,2015-05-01,31616407,Breanna,The room looked just like the picture.  The bathroom was a little bit dirty but to be expected for such a small space.  I did have some trouble communicating with the host.  I asked the address and ended up going back through emails to find it and so I was late to check in.  The host did not meet me there it was another man. I got a text from her asking where I was and the gentleman who let me in seemed to be very frustrated.  I would have liked to see a more professional approach in communication.
4527029,33944017,2015-06-02,33379279,Abhishek,"It was great staying at Orchid's place! I had book the room for 10 nights and had no problems during my stay. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Orchid is a warm and welcoming host. The neighbourhood is good, with a bar just below the house :) and a few good restaurants. The metro station (red line) is nearby (approx) 6-7 minutes walking distance. In a nutshell, a great place at the mentioned price."
4527029,35255319,2015-06-16,30977037,Jed,Orchid is very easy to transact with. The apartment is in a great location and the room is clean. There are plenty of bars and places to eat around.
4527029,36442915,2015-06-28,30977037,Jed,Always a pleasure to business with Orchid.
4527029,40134915,2015-07-28,36281040,Kiernon,"Navigating getting the key from the landlord, and arranging to check out, then check in again a few days later was easily done via text message / email with Orchid without having to meet each other. Orchid did suggest a visit to the beach at JFKUmass which was a good suggestion during this hot summer we were having. The room is as pictured: basic and spartan. I didn't really need much more than that. Orchid arranged to have a fan to keep me cool on the hot days / nights. There was a towel provided also and the linens were changed when I checked back in again for my second visit. I don't know if it was the summer heat but one first impression that may not be perfect for some guests: it's an old house and tends to retain a musty smell. I was able to get over this by using an air freshener in my room. If you have humble standards you may appreciate this place. If you're looking for a 5 star hotel type experience I would say find somewhere at a higher price. The experience was ok for what I paid for and helped while I was waiting to move into another apartment. The big plus is how close it is to the Red line, if that's useful to you."
4527029,47685877,2015-09-21,39915509,Kathleen,"The location is great, good acces to the metro, and I a nice person waited for me with the keys."
10051842,68115861,2016-04-02,57496686,Riitta,Very nice location. The apartment was with a beatiful view to the river. It was really nice to follow the practice of rowing teams at sun rise.
7308811,45103251,2015-08-31,8166827,Megan,"Sera was incredibly accommodating. A really wonderful host. The apartment was just as described. Very simple, mostly IKEA furnishings. Large kitchen, which was very nice to have. Super close to the train and Whole Foods. Air conditioners work very well (and we were there at the summer's hottest). We didn't use the tv at all, but the internet worked great. The apartment was also very clean! Thank you for the stay, Sera!"
7308811,45699985,2015-09-05,24291900,Zartash,"Though we did not get to meet Sera, she has been an excellent communicator - very crisply describing all the details of check in and check out etc. I had a few questions before I airbnb'ed this property and Sera provided quick and accurate responses."
The property itself is a cozy apartment (as per description) in a large apartment building.  It is not a new building (old elevator,old bathrooms,etc.),so it is important to set your expectations. The wash basin in the bathroom was running slow but usable; and we were very busy,so I could not make any effort to get this addressed. The living room was small but tidy and neatly decorated.,
The apartment building is NOT in the city or at walkable distances to the city but there Washington Street T station is less than 2-minute walk,so very convenient. We were a family,so instead of using T,we ended up using Lyft a lot,especially when they were running 50% off in Boston. Going to MIT area (where we mostly ended up going) through Lyft was just a few dollars.,
Parking is difficult around the area but we rented a car for couple of days and parked it overnight on the Washington street (at 2-hour free places,making sure we move the car in the morning).,,,,

Really good value for the price."

If you are a keen cyclist commuter maybe David's is a must stay!"
2884903,14790651,2014-06-26,11374,Kirsten,David is a superb host.  His listing will be missed.  I arrived the first time and he and his sister invited me to share dinner with them. The conversation and company could not have been better.  The second time I stayed I was invited to join David for a terrific session of yoga.

Downtown is only 15-20 min. away. The neighbourhood is really nice, lots of great restaurants and parcs to enjoy Boston. We all loved our stay. The communication with Marian was great before and during our stay. She is friendly and had organise a good summary of what is around and how to get here and there. We would definitly want to be back there in a future Boston visit. Thank you Marian!"
957224,4937286,2013-06-03,2590354,Wayne,"I live in this same neighborhood but had family coming for Graduation and needed more space. Marian's home was perfect, well located, clean, and parking is easy to find on the street. 3 family members stayed here, and they were quite content. The home was spacious, modern, and well appointed, with dishwasher, laundry, WiFi, and coffee maker. There is heat, but no air conditioning, we had two evenings of 95˚ weather and Marian did bring down 2 fans that we used. The only two things missing are a microwave and a TV (there is a very tiny flatscreen). But really, you probably did not come to Boston to watch the TV. Marian was very easy to contact and lives in the unit above the rental. The house is in a great part of town, very safe, gay-friendly, lots of good restaurants nearby, a Whole Foods about 2-blocks away, and great access to public transport (also easy to get to/from airport).  We even hosted a small gathering at the house (11 persons) post-graduation and had ample space, a good size fridge for stocking with food and beverages, and the house had plenty of kitchenware/glassware so that we did not need anything. There is a comfortable outdoor area that you also have access to that has two outdoor tables that seat about 8, so you could easily grill at night. All in all, we had a great 4-night stay and were well looked after. I would highly recommend this property to anyone coming to Boston. It is a great place, three full bedrooms, lots of space and all at a very reasonable price. Thanks Marian!"
957224,5058892,2013-06-10,6279762,Andres,"Marian was an excelent host and her apartment is very well located. You can go to the Orange or Green Subway line in less than 10 minutes by walk, so you can go to almost everywhere in Boston and Cambridge. Also the bus stop is just a few steps from the house, and it goes to Copley in minutes. We bought a 7 days Charlie ticket, so transportation was not a problem."
When we arrived the apartment was clean and organized. We were 6,and we have more than enough space with the 3 bedrooms. The apartment kitchen and pantry is big,so you can go to the market and eat at home. It also have a dinning and living room,so you wont have problems with the space.,,
Marian was very kind and helpful,and we were always in contact before arriving.,,,,

The information notebook she provided was helpful; it describes the house, neighborhood, transportation, restaurants and sites to visit.  Marian is a great communicator; we knew just what to expect and what to do upon arrival.  During our stay she brought us an iron and ironing board upon request, which we needed to prepare for a business engagement, and helped us find local tennis courts.  We highly recommend this rental."

The kitchen was well stocked with cookware, the dishwasher made cleanup easier and the laundry facilities in the house were convenient. There were many thoughtful touches available like family board games, a notebook with helpful information re nearby restaurants and grocery stores, and a laundry hamper to make things feel more like home. We also enjoyed walking around in the neighborhood, in particular the park down the street which had walking/jogging trails which were well maintained. Markets were within easy walking and driving distance. Marian was very accomodating and easy to reach. We would be happy to return during any future stays in Boston."

Miriam is super organized with a nice welcome book with instructions,local restaurant info,how to contact her and more. She requests that at the end of your stay,you pull off the bed sheets and leave them in the laundry area,so what was expected of us was very clear.,
Sheets were clean,bedrooms beautifully decorated,and the all of the toiletries one could require,as well as towels were available.,,
Her home is close in a nice quiet,yet bustling area with local foot traffic,shops and places to eat. If I could buy Miriam's house I would LOL :),,,
That's how comfortable we felt there.,,,,,
She was there for us if we needed her,but unintrusively kept her distance (not necessary),but she's respectful,and I liked that.,,

Thanks Miriam!!,,,,,

I also appreciated how clean the apartment was since we have a crawling baby. My older 2 children loved playing on the swing set in the back yard and we could easily watch them out the kitchen window. The pantry was stocked with all of the odds and ends one might need. Note that there is not a microwave, but it is easy to get by with the oven and stove. Whole Foods is an easy few minutes walk from the place, as is Centre Street, which has all of the best shops and restaurants in JP. We recommend City Feed for sandwiches and light groceries...the Tofurkey sandwich is amazing! Thanks, Marian, for such a great experience."
957224,9014614,2013-12-02,8245610,Lisa,"This apartment was recommended to us by friends who actually live in Jamaica Plain. We stayed here with our son (19) and three daughters (10,14,16). Great location and wonderful house. Beds are really comfortable which was a huge bonus! Cute neighborhood with grocery, restaurants, liquor store all within walking distance. Parking was not a problem either. The kitchen is wonderful and always makes it convenient when traveling. Also, very nice to have laundry available. There is not a microwave in the apartment which isn't that big a deal - reheated coffee on the stove top. I did ask Marian about a hair dryer which would have been handy since it was so incredibly cold during our stay. I've always had one when we've stayed in rentals. She indicated she would get one for the apartment. Highly recommend this rental and would definitely stay here again. Thank you for the nice accommodations Marian!"

Marian's house was exactly as advertised and the location is FANTASTIC!  We enjoyed wonderful morning walks around the Pond and loved the easy access to the train/downtown Boston.  Marian was responsive to our communications.  Would stay again.
957224,13237564,2014-05-23,4381020,Stephen & Victoria,We were married at Jamaica Pond Bandstand near Marian's Air BnB. The house was used for a party & reception venue and for lodging for my siblings. We had a delightful stay and celebration. The weather was perfect. We used the back yard with tables. We paid an extra fee for having our friends celebrate our small group of friends(mostly relatives) celebrate with us and an additional fee for the use of the driveway for parking during the period of the wedding and reception. (We chose the period of the weekly street cleaning parking ban for our wedding so parking was an issue).
957224,13342081,2014-05-26,2046699,Brian,"Marian's place was a perfect fit for my family which included 2 children, my wife, and in-laws. There were a few toys for the kids as well as a lovely backyard with play structure that kept the kids entertained. The neighborhood was safe and very convenient with everything we needed in close walking distance. We had two cars to park which can be very expensive in Boston, so having free on street parking with close public transit (2 minute walk to bus stop) was great. My wife has to have her run first thing in the morning so the close proximity to Jamaica Pond park was a blessing. I can't say enough about this place."

I arrived pretty late and he gave me great instructions on how to get settled and make myself feel at home. He even offered me food for breakfast.

The bed was very comfortable for two people, the wifi was fast and the room and toilet were really clean.

Could not have asked for a better host and place to stay!"
7277653,49150275,2015-10-01,42834542,Dave,Nathan and his girlfriend were very helpful.  I was only there one night so it was quick in and out. They even provided breakfast cereal.  Basic apartment but was very clean and they gave me the run of the place.  Thanks a bunch guys.

7277653,50037726,2015-10-08,8504020,Hans,"Really friendly. Nice room. Caring hosts. Handy location. Use of a bike came with the room and got a lot of use. best way to get around Boston and Cambridge when the weather's good, which it was."

7277653,50776359,2015-10-14,44392158,Do Yeun,"Very friendly and welcoming hosts.  We had a great time riding the bikes they provided all around Boston - it's a great way to see the city!  The apartment location was in a quiet area about 10 minutes' bike ride from Harvard Square and the route is fairly direct. Forgot an item there, and Nathan was eager to help with locating and sending it to me."
7277653,51297165,2015-10-19,8689731,Nor,"Nathan was an ideal host. He was there to show us around and answer questions, but left us alone when we needed it. The apartment was close to everything we needed. Within walking distance to Harvard, public transportation, the Charles river. A wonderful diner is around the corner and restaurants a short walk away. The apartment was modest, but clean, the bed comfortable and surprisingly quiet for a large city. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay."

7277653,53151534,2015-11-05,6502696,Guo,"I had a brief stay at Nathan's place. But it was absolutely a great time. He (and his partner Michelle too) is nice and welcoming, knows the Boston area well and willing to have a good conversation. The location is super, the neighborhood is quiet and the rate is reasonable. What more can you ask? Give it a try!"
7277653,53499240,2015-11-09,45690090,Claudio,"Nate was a great host. He has a friendly and laid-back personality, and was very helpful and informative when we asked him where to go in Boston. The bedroom was clean and comfortable, as was the bathroom. The bikes provided were also in great condition and really made getting around Boston much easier, without the extra cost of hiring bikes."
7277653,53734641,2015-11-11,535046,Jonathan,"Nathan is a great host. He was very welcoming, and gave me a bunch of tips for the smoothest of arrivals. The neighbourhood is quiet, and is perfectly located if you are interested in visiting the Harvard Campus."

7277653,55029310,2015-11-27,25375394,Chokechai,Nathan and Richelle are really sincere and friendly. They tried to help us with what we needed. The location was very closed to Havard Square where  we could eadily take T train red line and buses to all points of interesting. There were 7-11 nearby. The room was exactly the same as the pix with heater to make us warm after a long day outside. We also used the kitchen preparing our breakfast. Nathan also offered us to use his bicycles. We will recommend our friends to stay with them for sure.
7277653,55630505,2015-12-03,19923971,Zhaocheng,"We stayed in Nathan's place while we spent one day in Boston. The room was very close to Harvard Business School. You can use free bikes to go to Harvard square, MIT, and downtown Boston. It was quiet and lovely place, we enjoyed our stay there."
7277653,56262266,2015-12-11,10259807,Jenna,"I really enjoyed my stay with Nate and Richelle.  I was warmly welcomed then left to use the apartment like it was my own.  The use of a bike was my personal highlight as I was able to get anywhere in Boston easily!  The room is basic but cosy and the bed very comfortable.  I didn't get much of a chance to cross paths with my hosts after my arrival but Nate was available on mobile any time I needed to contact him.  Good quiet location, easy bike ride to Harvard.  Happily recommend to others looking to stay within easy access of Cambridge.  Only other thing of note is the apartment is on the top floor so there's a few stairs to get up if you have a big bag like me!"
7277653,56535846,2015-12-14,15818284,Zj,Nathan was a great host. I enjoyed my stay and the location was perfect. Will definitely book again if I travel to Boston!

Nathan and Richelle were very accommodating, they left spare keys in a secure place that we could have access to through out our stay.

I would definitely stay with them again! Thank you for making this trip so easy for us!"

It was a great experience.  The room was as advertised, clean and convenient and Nathan and his girlfriend were very nice hosts."

The room and bathroom were clean and well appointed. I appreciated the water bottle they left for me."
7277653,71895271,2016-04-29,24287625,Lillian,"Nathan was a great host. My interactions with him were nothing but positive - he was very responsive, polite, and helpful. Because we checked in late and checked out early in the morning I didn't have a chance to meet him in person, but he was still extremely helpful with any questions I had and made our trip to Boston easy. The room and location are exactly as described, and the photos in the listing are accurate. The bed was very comfortable, especially after a long day of travel.  The apartment was in a convenient location and it was a simple bus ride to Harvard. I would recommend the room to anyone traveling to Harvard University or the business school for a conference or related event."
7277653,72498587,2016-05-02,68153512,Mark,Nate and his fiancée were very warm and inviting. They have great suggestions of places to check out in the area and were very accommodating of our early arrival and late departure. We were in town for a visit to HBS and their house was a very quick walk down the street. The room was just as described/pictured and we felt very comfortable sharing their home. We would definitely stay here again!
7277653,75488320,2016-05-21,18952320,Xiaojie,"Thanks Nathan and his GF, wonderful experience!"

"\"",,,,,
7277653,77527257,2016-06-01,23108232,Justin,"Staying with Nathan was excellent. He was very flexible with our weird timing and even helped figure out where to park our car. Easy location with a $6 uber into Harvard square Mede it a really convenient place to stay. Clean sheets, window fan kept it cold and comfortable at night. He was on top of communicating with us and made sure that we had everything that we needed."
7277653,78750104,2016-06-08,19957710,Jose,O Nathan é muito simpatico e me fez sentir bem vindo desde o primeiro contato. O local é excelente para quem precisa estar na Harvarda Business School ou Havard Kennedy School. A vizinhança é agradavel. Pena que nao tive tempo de aproveitar a bicicleta que ele oferece aos seus hóspedes.
7277653,79667771,2016-06-13,50833238,Adriano,"Our stay with Nathan was short but definitely the right choice. Nathan was very accommodating, having everything we could need at our disposal. As for the location, we were less than a 15 minute drive from downtown and all the must see locations. We highly recommend staying with Nathan."
7277653,80206699,2016-06-16,3761176,Dylan,"Nathan's place is very comfortable and exactly as pictured--two bedrooms and one bath on the third floor. Comfy bed and a fan for the summer months. A ten-minute walk to HBS to the north or ten minutes south to all of the bars/restaurants on Brighton Ave. And an awesome diner, the Breakfast Club, just around the corner. A great spot!"
7277653,81768201,2016-06-25,27363396,Mudit,"As Always, it was a pleasant stay!"

Our personal highlight were the two bikes which made getting around Boston easy. Public transport to the city center is about 30 min, nearby Harvard Square is a great location for having dinner or going out!"
7277653,87961619,2016-07-22,27363396,Mudit,"As always, It was a great stay."
7277653,91404510,2016-08-05,84515890,Selina,"Nate is very friendly and makes us feel welcome. We see he had many visitors from different countries in the world because the visitors can pin their hometown on the work map at their private room. This is very nice. When I booked the room, there was no air conditioning available. Probably, it is a hot summer for Boston. Nate bought an A/C for the room shortly. It is a big A/C and works well but makes noise as all the others do. Perhaps, I am spoiled by the quiet center A/C at home. My biggest impression is the cleanness. The whole apartment is very clean. It is at least as clean as a 4-star hotel. I couldn't see any dirt or hair anywhere at the apartment. How can they keep the apartment so clean?! I guess Nate's fiance contributes a lot to maintain the apartment clean all the time. I tried to keep my private room and the shared bathroom as clean as possible."
Another nice thing is that Nate provides visitors/guests two bikes. I rode the bike to Havard and MIT. It is really convenient. There are many bike-friendly roads around.I decided to get a bike for myself afterward.,,,,,
Last but not least,Nate and his finance are very quiet,polite and thoughtful. They stayed in their room quietly after we arrived the apartment and gave us guidance. They let us use the living room,kitchen,and bathroom freely.,
Nate is a very good host that provides a quiet,clean,"and cozy place for guests. The listed price is reasonable for the location and condition. We   would like to stay there again next time.\"",,,

7277653,98353910,2016-08-30,79336287,Priyanka,"Nathan's place was very comfortable, spacious and tidy. He guided us on what places to visit and also how to get there. Even though we reached early in the morning we had no issues getting access to our room. He made himself available on the phone in case we had any questions during our stay. He was very helpful and we had a wonderful time at Boston. We would strongly recommend Nathan's place to anyone visiting Boston."
10454061,60417187,2016-01-23,36366085,James,"The place was great to stay in. Conveniently located within walking distance of loads of pubs and restaurants.

10454061,75337965,2016-05-20,13258968,Adele,Great location and comfortable studio.  You're half a block from
Newbury,"5-10 min walk to Boston commons. Plenty of bike shares nearby. Warning though- the apartment will be filled with light once the sun comes up (the blinds really don't do anything so bring an eye shield if you're a light sleeper) and you can easily hear street noises. Also the host doesn't respond to msgs via Airbnb but they go through a management company and you can easily call them . We arrived early and left our bags at an inn about 10-15 mins walk away. \"",,,,
10454061,77707955,2016-06-03,47711581,Shawn,"Excellent experience.

Much better option than the standard hotel!"
10454061,81540246,2016-06-23,26267156,Maggie,The location of the place is great! Easy walk to Fenway and other Boston hot spots. Good local coffee literally on the corner and a Trader Joes a block away made the stay a breeze.
This place is ran by a Inn management service which gave it a bit more of a hotel feel than some in home Airbnbs.,,,,,
Only complaint may be the bed wasn't great. Also be warned of stairs aren't your thing this was a 3rd floor walk up and the stairs are old brownstone twisty and uneven.,,,,,
"Definitely recommend and would stay again when in Boston! \"",,,,,
10454061,89219647,2016-07-27,8364698,Sean,Great location right between Newbury and Commonwealth in Back Bay. The AC works great and the room had all of the amenities that we needed. I would definitely stay here again!

While it does require either a car or a bus ride to reach the subway, it is still very close to downtown Boston.

This eas the best value we found in the area, and we were not disappointed!"

9918713,57956347,2015-12-30,10831726,Antonio,"I had requested this apartment and a few others - Kara accepted me and I booked the apartment.  A few hours after Mike accepted me for the same identical apartment.  Thanks to Mike I became aware that they both work for the same company that has several apartment for rent in the same building.  The apartment I rented was not the same as the one in the picture, no balcony and no fireplace.  Mike was charging less than Kara, totally confusing.  Kara accepted to match the price of Mike but she did not.  The apartment was a nice unit.  A bit sterile corporate rental without light for the dining table, but we used the light of the desk.  The location is great very close to everything."

The place was in a very quiet part of town, but a quick walk to many great restaurants in the area.  It honestly felt as if we were staying at a close friends house.  The parking situation was a little tricky at times, but Jill's response time and ability to help us out was fantastic.  We would definitely stay here again!"

She wasn't there when I arrived but made arrangements for me to be able to get in, and had left very clear and thoughtful notes around the place so I would know house rules, the wifi password, what the neighborhood was like, etc.  The guest room was very comfortable and quiet."
9279773,54771181,2015-11-23,17919987,Aina,"Wonderful stay with Rebecca, thank you for everything! She was very accommodating with my late arrival and was even so kind as to leave the light on for me. Room was clean, comfortable and spacious. Just a short train ride away from South Station in a residential neighborhood, perfect for some peace and quiet. Overall, a very positive experience and I would thoroughly recommend anyone to stay here!"
9279773,54950145,2015-11-25,41959443,Bernice,"The place is really clean although it is a old house and near to the train. Rebecca is really a good host, she communicate with us before we went to  her house and give  a very quick response to our questions, we love the tea that she provided at the house. I like the food that she recommended us which near her house and we had a wonderful time with her."
9279773,55694904,2015-12-04,11374528,Lan,"Awesome, that's all I can say.  I stayed for three nights with Becca, and she is super chill, very easy to communicate with.  The apartment is beautiful and very neatly furnished.  The location is also great for people going into the city since it's right next to the T.  I'm also a fan of Savin Hill since the neighborhood is quiet and safe (as far as I can tell from the three times that I've stayed in the area).  Would highly recommend!"
9279773,55831091,2015-12-06,46890989,Abbie,Rebecca is a very nice host! And her home is very convenient and clean! She gave us vey clear guidance for her place which helps the guests to find it. Strongly recommend this sweet place. Hope I can go back somedays in the future!

Great restaurants in the area: McKenna's (brunch)-get there early- long lines, Harp n Bard (Local good pub), Shanti (Indian), dBar, Pho Hoa and Pho Le (South of Savin Hill). Enjoy the neighborhood. Easy access to Boston and Logan Airport too."
9279773,58565553,2016-01-03,19659736,Shawn,"While I didn't get a chance to meet Rebecca in person, she was one of the best communicators I have dealt with on Airbnb.  Her apartment is located in a nice area with easy access to public transportation but yet was quiet at night.  The apartment and room were great and she was well prepared with information and suggestions in the neighborhood.  Would definitely stay here again if in Boston."

If you really like to walk - walking distance to restaurants, bars, small markets and a beach in the Dorchester, South Boston area.  Rebecca was out of town but still a very helpful host.  Her place was very clean and had everything we needed.  We would definitely stay there again."

9279773,90963596,2016-08-03,36874567,Sara,La casa di Rebecca é a pochi minuti dalla metropolitana che permette di raggiungere Il centro di Boston in pochi minuti. Il prezzo é buono se paragonato agli alti costi di un alloggio nel centro di Boston.

9279773,99361708,2016-09-04,317207,Freddi,Rebecca is a role model of a gracious hostess and the perfect AIrbnb experience. Rebecca takes great pride in creating a wonderful setting for guests at her home and is focused on making sure that her guests have everything they need for a comfortable visit. I have stayed at a number of Airbnb's and Rebecca and the lovely space she has created is definitely where I would return to the next time I am in Boston.

The space was just as described -- super clean, cozy and comfortable.  The private entrance to the street was convenient and her place was a short walk from the Garden."

The little touches were the best part, like the chalk board with \"\"Welcome to Boston!\"\" handwritten on it. Brie was an oustanding host and was really helpful with coordinating for check in and check out time. The location was great. We used North station often to catch the T"
4558443,32355608,2015-05-17,29817984,Brigett,"Brie was beyond fantastic and welcoming. It was such a great experience. Her place was a perfect retreat for me. Beautiful, clean, very comfortable, quiet but close to everything. Love the neighborhood and location. I will definitely book here again in the future."
4558443,33616584,2015-05-30,10521779,Susan,It was a great experience working with Brie. She was very communicative and responsive . Her location was clearly marked with great instructions upon arrival. Brie was also very flexible as our arrival plans changed a few times. Her home was in a superb location with a public parking garage conveniently located at the beginning of the street. The neighborhood was fantastic steps to all sorts of great dining and walkways especially along the waterfront. It was a really great and inspiring visit!

She was available by text and phone and responsive to my questions in advance of my stay.  She even gave me a great restaurant recommendation."
The apartment is as described on the AirBnB site.  A small-ish but well appointed studio and decorated in a charming,home-y style. Everything I needed for my 2 day,business travel stay was there.  The apartment has a separate entrance on a quiet street.  The daybed actually has a full twin mattress plus lots of pillows.  It is not a pull-out couch or fold-out futon.  It was quite comfortable and worked well both as a bed and a couch.,,,
I was able to easily get around the city by Uber (recommended by Brie Ana- thanks!) and could pick up a cab at Hanover street about 5 minutes walk.  This was necessary for my trip and no problem.,,,,,
The neighborhood was a nice surprise.  I have been to Boston several times but never before stayed on the North End.  The apartment is about 3 blocks from Hanover Street,a sort of Little Italy area with many great Italian restaurants and several very tempting Italian bakeries (dieters beware!)  It is obviously also an area with a high density of young people and college students,and has an energetic and academic vibe.  As a single female traveler I felt quite safe walking around by myself in the evening.,,,

4558443,46192393,2015-09-08,41868283,Derek,This was my wife and I's first Airbnb experience and we could not have asked for a better host! Never actually got to meet Brie but she was very helpful on directing us on where and what we needed. This location is unbelievable and walking distance to almost everything. Not to mention the cozy studio with its own private entrance that brings you right onto the street. I would recommend anyone to stay here! Thanks again Brie!
4558443,48928170,2015-09-29,43695926,Debra,"Brie was always available and responsive to our inquiries, and although we didn't get to meet in person upon arrival, we had easy access to the Studio, and I thank her for the use of her home.  The best thing is the fantastic location of this apt. in the North End, and the direct entry into the home (no stairs or walk-ups)!  The location is a  short distance away from the Freedom Trail, Old North Church, and over 120 restaurants, walking distance.  This was our first experience with Air BnB, it went well, and we were comfortable in the apt.  The pics are representative of the studio itself, it's comfy, and my only comment would be that the bathroom is very small."
4558443,50654967,2015-10-13,32575104,Alexa,"Brie was really wonderful. She made sure I had everything I needed. I got in really early, and she stayed in contact and helped me to get in.

4558443,54647535,2015-11-22,22936898,Karen,"A great little hideaway--going thru a door that made me think of Hobbits. My husband and I walked into a quaint studio apartment that fit are needs exquisitely....had unexpected noise from thee making of a movie (pretty fun actually), Brie was responsive and very accommodating. Hope to make her place our 'go to' place when visiting our son."

The space was clean, cozy, and welcoming, and had everything I needed (including coffee - a huge plus!). I really appreciated being able to get into the apartment earlier on the day of my arrival, as well as the private entrance. Plus, you can't beat the North End location, which puts you right in the heart of a ton of restaurants, bakeries, etc. I had a great visit! Thank you!!!"

4558443,71203759,2016-04-24,49380457,Spenser,"Location. Location. Location. If you're looking for a home base while exploring Boston this is the spot. The studio is quite cozy, but very clean and well maintained. The only problem we had was the noise. We must be light sleepers, because the street and surrounding apartment noise kept us up all night. But, that's the price you pay when you want to stay in the middle of everything.  Embrace walking or taking Uber, you don't want fight parking on the 1-way streets of the North End, we'd even out a few blocks before getting our Uber to avoid the congestion. Overall a great stay!"
4558443,77306021,2016-05-31,31538782,Laura,This is a lovely apartment and the location is awesome!! Stayed here to attend an event on TD Garden and it was a 5 minute walk.If you are touring the city you are steps away from Freedom trail. And some awesome pizza place is just around the corner!
Apartment is just as the pictures,maybe even cuter in person,full of details. Both beds were comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and blankets. Bathroom is tiny but has all you may need,Brie even provided shampoo,soap and toothpaste. Communication with Brie was good and promptly. I would love to come back to this location on a future trip to Boston.,

It is cosy,small and clean enough.,,,,
What I did not like is the lack of daylight,but if you do not need to spend a lot of time inside (and most people who come to Boston do not) then you may not even notice it.,,,,

-Location: Awesome,steps away from great Italian restaurants and bakeries +7Eleven +T station (orange line to downtown+ green line to the Newbury str).,,,,
Having a private entrance from street directly to the studio is a good thing for easy access,bad thing when you can hear the people walking by at the street + I had trouble sleeping for two nights because of an active upstairs neighbor.,,,,
-Furniture: shabby chic Full of colors and details. I was hoping to have space in a closet. However,there was an empty bench to put the clothes in and plenty of hangers to compensate.,,,,
-Cleanness: the studio overall was clean so do the bathroom (I liked having a new towels!),,,,,
Although I didn't met Brie in person,she was a very good communicator,flexible,gave me a specific instructions and made sure that I have everything I need.,,

4558443,99644282,2016-09-05,7243321,Jodi,Location location location! The studio was perfect for our stay.  5 minute walk to The Garden and tons of restaurants and shops in little Italy.  The red T line is just around the corner so you can explore areas outside of the north end.  I would walk if you could since Boston is a great walking city.  The studio is about the size of a hotel room so don't expect a lot of space.  We didn't experience the noisy neighbors as other reviewers mentioned so that was a pleasant surprise.

2722165,12094541,2014-04-22,8904123,Alanna,"David's loft was huge and was an awesome place to come home to at day's ends. The loft has a funky, artsy, urban feel, and we made regular use of his record player. Four of us stayed there over Boston Marathon weekend. I didn't realize until our arrival how centrally located the loft was. Beacon Hill, Boston Commons, the North End, and pretty much everything else were in easy walking distance (for those who don't mind walking). David was also very hospitable and attentive to our needs. He responded promptly over email and by text once we arrived in the city. The beds were comfortable and clean, and the apartment had everything we needed (including an iron and French press for coffee). The bathroom compared to the rest of the apartment was rustic and small, but as long as you're not looking for a nice hot bath at the end of the day, it fits the bill."

2722165,20017600,2014-09-22,2853631,Wisam,Pros:

- The space is very large.,,,,,

Cons:,,,,,
- 5 large,rickety flights of stairs up and down to the condo,,,,
- The place was mostly clean but definitely feels worn in,,,,,
- Washroom is pretty dingy. Toilet hugs the wall so you need to sit at an angle,the sink in the washroom was broken so we had to use the kitchen sink,the shower is small and unpleasant,shower floor mat was dirty.,,
I would rate David's place a 6/10,"it would be a 7/10 if you could replace the whole washroom situation. \"",,,,

We didn't want to leave. It has character. Awesome character. Like Miles Davis character.  David was a great host and kept reassuring us to make ourselves at home, gave us plenty of recommendations on cool stuff to do in Boston. He was the best! I would describe the neighborhood as urban undergoing gentrification a bit. Very central to everything. The apartment is on the top floor and very secure and we felt safe in it but I might not hang out in the alley by yourself at night or anything. But that's just general good travel advice no matter where you go. We want to come back!"

2722165,48149363,2015-09-23,44375960,Malory,"David was an impeccable host, making our arrival painless and our stay a true delight. He really knows how to handle the difficult ratio between the privacy of guests and accessibility, and we loved it. The location was favorable- in walking distance to the boston commons and dozens of shops, cafes, restaurants, and bars. The loft was cozy and clean, and there was an ample amount of space. Strongly recommended and can't wait to come back."
2722165,48612218,2015-09-27,1279093,Will,This is a very cool and bohemian space. Tons of light in the morning and the beds are comfortable. The hanging chair is a delight. On the downside it can be a bit noisy at night and the bathroom is quite spartan (Nice shower thought). David was a very gracious host.
2722165,48908472,2015-09-29,42725249,Yeye,"It is amazing to live in the loft to stay for three days in boston. We have four people to visit the city. And David is a very friendly host and met us in the loft and  left useful messages on the desk. The loft is just beside the chinatown and downtown, you can walk to the Boston common and the freedom trail."
2722165,51118352,2015-10-18,1768177,Nancy,"I am a college teacher and a colleague and I rented David's place to stay in while our 25 students stayed at the nearby hostel.  We spent 10 days studying Puritan New England. David's place was ideal for our needs.  It was large enough to meet with the entire group, and even to break up the class into three smaller groups for seminars.  It's close to all kinds of cheap food, large and light, and with a very relaxed atmosphere.  It's a very urban neighborhood, and noisy, but not at all unlivable.  We were very happy with our stay and hope to come again.  Thanks so much, David!"

2722165,63361607,2016-02-22,23678550,子文,This loft is fantastic and huge. It will be a very nice place to stay. David is a very nice host. He fully prepared for our trip. Highly recommended.
2722165,67268467,2016-03-27,47936239,Trevor,David was a wonderful host who made himself available every step of the way during our trip! His apartment is clean and very spacious and I'd definitely recommend this spot for the next person since its relatively close to the metro as well.
2722165,69000702,2016-04-08,2163623,Jasmine,David was very communicative and open about expectations . The place is as gorgeous as it looks. Stayed with a few coworkers for a conference and the place was super convenient for all our needs.

"I would definitely recommend this loft. \"",,,,,
2722165,70691138,2016-04-19,1150826,Hayley,My boyfriend and I booked David's loft for our Patriot's Day/Boston Marathon weekend in Boston. The location couldn't have been more convenient and accessible--literally a 5 minute walk from South Station (probably less if we were more familiar with the diagonal streets of Boston and not hauling our bags). And a five minute walk from Boston Commons in the other direction--where we needed to be very early on Monday morning to get out to run the marathon.
We felt extremely safe in the Chinatown neighborhood--not a strong,visible police presence,but a community with great respect for their neighborhood.,,,
David made us feel right at home. Though he was hosting us from Europe,he had a fresh bouquet greeting us,along with a note on how to make ourselves feel more at home in the loft and the neighborhood.,,,
The loft is very spacious--more than enough room for 4 if folks don't mind sleeping in bags on the floor.,,,,,
Kitchen is complete for preparing meals--we prepared our pre-marathon dinner there and had tools to make brunch after the race the next morning.,,,,,
As stated in previous reviews,bathroom is spartan,but it gets the job done. And though there is a hot water heater that looks small in the kitchen,hot water was plentiful!,,
"\"",,,,,
2722165,71185453,2016-04-24,49351163,Benjamin,"The Loft was everything we needed it to be. The open, spacious, and comfortable feel of the loft provided a great setting to be social with any of the friends you can share it with. David provided all the needed info for us to make the most of our time in Boston as well as some great meal recommendations in China Town which is a stone's throw from the loft. It's a great location between two T stations that are a short walk in opposite directions but allow access to both Red/Orange lines. Easy access parking right across the street or for something cheaper(weekends) you can park on top of South Station 3-4 blocks away. The beds and all the furniture including the 2 large couches were quite comfortable and provided a great spot to rest your feet or crash for the night after walking the city. Overall the loft was the right fit for us."
2722165,72854754,2016-05-05,2940791,Yair,Great loft

2722165,74164090,2016-05-13,10181639,Dominic,David made sure we were able to get into the apartment and his locations was awesome. Very cool way to experience Boston. I would recommend this place to anyone.
2722165,75421084,2016-05-21,68792094,Maria Giuseppina,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we loved it. First of all, we're really grateful to David, who waited for us, who were arriving by plane from Italy, till late afternoon for our check in. As promised, David's loft is just in the centre of Boston. It is surprisingly spacious and cozy and lovely bohemian. The two bedrooms were perfect for the three of us: my husband and I, and a gourmet friend traveling with us, who found in the nearby chinese stores all sort of special food to cook in David's well-equipped kitchen. Only the bathroom is small and really essential. The 5-storey walk-up was not a problem for us, but it could be for other people."
The open space with the large windows and the sofa and the large table was the perfect place to let our minds work on future project. We did enjoy our stay in David's house.,,,,,

2722165,76323931,2016-05-26,48475946,Cecilia,"I didn't have the chance to stay at David's flat, but my friends Henrik and Emil had a great time at David's beautiful studio. The location is perfect. David was very helpful and we would warmly recommend staying here."
2722165,76992374,2016-05-30,30242886,Simran,"The loft was really beautiful and enough space for the four of us! The entire aesthetic of the place was amazing along with the awesome turntable! David gave us clear instructions/notes before we got there so everything was smooth. We were prepared for five flight of stairs and yes, it was a struggle taking luggage up and down them, but it was manageable. One of problems we faced had to do with the bathroom. There wasn't any mat next to the shower or hand towel next to the sink. Hence we would mostly use the kitchen sink for all purposes because it was impractical to wash our hands in the bathroom sink, but dry our hands with the kitchen hand towel. Also, I'm not sure if the place wasn't clean properly or because the windows were open 24/7, but my clean feet wouldn't last 5 minutes walking around without shoes without them getting completely dirty again. So I would definitely bring a pair of house slippers. Lastly, we had a horrible experience on our last day with the temperatures being 90 degrees. Living in the south, we know heat, but it was even worse without an AC. It was unbearable and oddly enough, it was cooler outside the apartment versus inside it (heat definitely rises in this building). The entire apartment felt like a sauna so I would either wait until a AC is installed or avoid this place in the summer."
2722165,80355805,2016-06-17,54547821,Loraya,He was great and responsive.
2722165,83420088,2016-07-02,39246703,Chris,David was a fantastic host and the apartment was exactly as described. Our check in and check out was super easy and David gave us great tips on things to see and do in the area. The location was also perfect for exploring the city by foot!
"I would highly recommend David and will definitely book again next time I'm in town!\"",,,,,
2722165,91973093,2016-08-07,32075617,Samantha,"David's place is an eclectic, spacious, and fun place to live. I was worried that it would get too hot in the summer, but truthfully, it was fine. There were a few scorcher days, in which I would retreat to the spacious bedroom, but mostly it was just summery and fine. There is a really good vibe about the place, and the location is amazing: right next to the Chinatown arch. David is an incredibly gracious and caring host, who checked in with me often. The only downside I will mention is for those of you who are really picky about your sleep: every morning at 4:30a, there is a loud garbage compactor thing that goes off outside the bedroom window. So wear ear plugs! But seriously, this place is a find."
2722165,92501602,2016-08-08,87315998,Erinn,David was awesome! He's instructions were great and super communicative during the whole stay if needed. The apartment was awesome and perfect for our short stay. Would definitely go back. Thank you David for a wonderful weekend!
2722165,98812169,2016-09-02,15275702,Jacob,David has a cool pad and the location is perfect for visiting the downtown area.  He was also a great host. Highly recommended.
4223387,20727635,2014-10-04,13549453,Sairah,"Cora's home is in a quiet, well-lit neighborhood a hop and a skip away from the Stonybrook T station.  I felt very safe walking in the area at night the first time I arrived and on the way to buy food from Jamaica Plain for the next few nights."
Cora was very responsive to my request for a new set of towels. She also allowed me to store food in the fridge during my stay and gave helpful directions to access local breakfast and lunch/dinner places to appease my grumbling stomach.,,,,,
If you're in the house during your stay in daylight hours,it's pretty quiet (the house and the street) which is nice for doing work (emailing,calling,etc). While the bathroom is shared,there wasn't a time when I wanted to use it and it wasn't vacant.  Cora will also let you know ahead of time if she'll be home doing work so you don't belt out Aretha Franklin when you thought you were alone.,
Wifi works well (given that my laptop has the world's worst wi-fi catching ability,this was pretty important to me). The bed was comfortable and warm and I didn't experience discomfort.,,,,
The area is very walkable with food (already made),grocery,and personal stores (e.g. Walgreens,CVS in Jamaica Plain) within a mile.,,
If you're staying for a short stay in Boston and you're looking for a quiet and convenient abode,I'd recommend Cora's home.,,,,

The room and the bathroom were all (very nicely) done anyways. There's a lot of space in the room, Wifi, fresh linen and towels and easy parking on the streets. Also a very friendly host.

4223387,28764320,2015-03-29,1164082,Eddie,"Cora's convenient Victorian was as described in the profile and our needs were adequately met. The stairs were as creaky as described and with the bathroom on the second floor it does make each trip to the bathroom feel like an imposition to the household. The beds were comfy, the room was warm and the bathroom spotless. The neighborhood was safe, well lit, and close to the T. We were able to store our bags for the day while we went sight seeing, which we greatly appreciated. We enjoyed breakfast at Sorrella's on Centre Street, a short walk away."
4223387,29333085,2015-04-06,13582578,Mariko,"Comfortable sunny room with plenty of space to spread out our belongings.  The bathroom was newly renovated and we enjoyed lots of extra hot water.  There was plenty of parking, which is hard to come by in Boston.  Charming Victorian home."

+Pros: house is 10 minute walk from Stony Brook metro station,which was great. Her son Hashell is really sweet at giving the instructions to guests. Nice renovated bathroom! Clean room and clean sheets!,,,,
-Negs: room was quite cold on the first night,possibly because the went was shut. Second night was great though! Creaky stairs which could wake you up when nature calls the next door neighbor in the middle of the night.,,,,

There's a great café called Ula at the Old Brewery a few minutes walk away, and close by, a nice Cuban restaurant called The Old Havana. I drove and street parking was available and safe. The accommodation is extremely neat and quiet if you don't mind creaky floorboards in a historic old house, and the host Cora was extremely nice and patient. Would book again if in the area."

The host was very kind and a gentle person and she was very accommodating with the fact that i arrived at 10:00PM each night. The house is in an excellent neighborhood. A comfortable 5 min walk to the T for going to downtown Boston. Lots of nice restaurants and grocery stores (ULA Cafe & Bella Luna Restaurant) nearby. All in all I will book it again for my next trip to Boston.

We stayed in her third floor room on two hot days. I was concerned that we might be uncomfortable because it was not air conditioned. However, she had two fans running and the room was very pleasant.  We also enjoyed her neighborhood and walking to the local restaurants. I recommend this location to others and will certainly stay there again if in town."

Even though we saw each other only briefly, she was great with communication beforehand.  Her and her husband Joe are very nice in person, and Joe even recommended a great sandwich place close by I went to twice.  Their house is very clean and beautiful, and the bathroom is HUGE!  My room even had a desk which I used to do some work.  Luckily Cora had gotten an A/C just in time for my trip!  I think it may have an eco-friendly feature on it, that can't go below a certain temperature(? I didn't really fiddle with the buttons too much - too tired after my trip!), but it kept the room at a nice temp for me (may not be for you if you like it super cold, like 60°).  The neighborhood is very cute, with lots of old pretty houses with gardens in front, and the place is super close to the Orange line T.  Even though it looks like it's far out on the transit map, I got around faster than I thought with ease.  I'll definitely see if Cora's available for my trip next year!"

I left the Airbnb that I originally booked due to its location, uncleanliness and hostile roommate. David and his assistant Jose were very nice and helpful. Lots of shopping places and restaurants within a short walking distance. The room was clean, private, and upscale. I will definitely stay here again!"

She’s very hospitable and respectful to your privacy. Moreover, she’s excellent at pastry-making, prepares delicious breakfast! This is definitely a place where you feel comfortable, as if you were at home, and that, traveling abroad is a key factor. It is my pleasure to recommend Susan."

232990,516211,2011-09-09,989883,Shashi,"I stayed in Susan's home for a week as an airbnb guest. She is a gracious host who really emphasizes hospitality.  I woke up every morning to a fresh homemade breakfast and occasionally cookies and sweet treats. It's easy to see she is good at what she does and more importantly, she genuinely enjoys hosting people at her residence. Susan has a beautiful home in a cozy neighborhood which is located in a very convenient location right around the corner from the Shawmut T station. All in all, I had a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend Susan."

We got in late at night, just steps from a T stop, and she was baking cookies for us.  The lodgings were comfortable, roomy, and private.  The location could not have been more convenient.  And the home made breakfasts were wonderful.  I'd pick Susan as a first choice next time."

Ella es just Amazing!¡ -  La casa se encuentra solo a 5 minutos de la estación del metro en un tranquilo vecindario, Susan es una gran guía turística, puede darte muchos consejos acerca de la ciudad; sus desayunos y en especial sus cookies son deliciosos. Os animo a compartir esta experiencia."
저는 친구와 함께 이곳에 머물렀는데 정말 말이 필요없는 매력적인 B&B였습니다. 처음에 호텔을 알아보다가 보스턴 물가가 너무 비싸서 차선책으로 알아본 곳이었는데 너무나 만족스러운 선택이었습니다.,,,,,
Susan은 따로 일정이 없던 저희에게 3일내내 꽉 찬 여행을 할 수 있게 완벽한 정보를 제공해 주었고 깔끔하고 모던하고 너무 아름다운 그녀의 집은 구석구석 그녀의 감각의 묻어 나는 사랑스러운 공간이었습니다.,,,,,
정갈한 아침식사는 아침부터 그녀로부터 대접 받는 기분을 들게 해 주었고 매일 저녁 그녀와 함께하는 대화는 잊을 수 없는 추억입니다.,,,,,

By running a tight ship, she ensures you will have everything you need and that guests are considerate of each other. Our room was cozy, and the comfortable bed was perfect after long days of site-seeing."
The breakfast was delicious and be prepared to be surprised by delightful treats throughout your stay. :),,,,,
Just a short walk to the T,you'll be able to get anywhere in Boston easily. And Susan is a wonderful resource--providing helpful tips and suggestions for things to do and places to eat.,,,,

Her house was clean, orderly, and located very close to the Shawmut T station.  Susan was a fantastic host and really helped make our Boston trip memorable.  It was a pleasure meeting her and I would recommend her BnB to anyone visiting Boston."
232990,1829323,2012-07-29,2769714,David,"This was my 1st experience through air bnb. I hope that all future stays are as comfortable. Breakfast was great with something special prepared fresh each day, and plenty of good advice on what to do in town. Susan greeted me at 10:30pm after a long 30 hour journey. The bed was really comfortable!"
232990,1878279,2012-08-03,2610267,Paula,I had a great time at Susan's place. She is an amazing host and cooks very well. The house is 3 minutes from the metro that goes straight to downtown. I so recommend this place that I'm here again. Thanks for everything Susan.

232990,2797785,2012-11-04,2951453,Ayub,"I came to Boston on a 2 month secondment in research. The house is close to all amenities and has a subway stop very close by. It’s in a fairly quiet neighbourhood which is great to unwind in after the hustle and bustle of long day in the City/work. Onto the room, it was very roomy, with plenty of space. There was a small desk great for getting things done, alongside a dresser and a closet for clothes. Susan looked after the room well and provided courteous service with respect to it throughout."
For a short stay I’d definitely recommend this place however for something longer I would definitely not. There are rules and regulations in place,which are understandable,but are applied and enforced haphazardly leading to misery. From the third week of my stay everything crumbled and I stayed on in constant terror of what I may fall foul of. Unfortunately,I was unable to move as the place had been prepaid by my organization. Everything looked rosy,but I stayed on with these problems.,

232990,10829727,2014-03-09,2464441,Mike,"Every time I come to Boston, I check to see if Susan's house is available. The house is absolutely charming, with comfortable rooms and nicely furnished common spaces. The location is also great: there is a Redline stop just a couple of blocks away, so you have all of the convenience of the downtown but little noise. Most importantly, Susan is a fantastic host! She made us delicious breakfasts each morning, and if we were all home in the evening, we would sit and chat at length about all kinds of topics. Staying with Susan is like staying with an old and dear friend. She is an easy host, giving her guests their space, but also a great person to just sit and enjoy a cup of tea with."
232990,11118126,2014-03-21,13009305,Jon,"My first experience with airbnb and it certainly sent me off with warm, fuzzy feelings. Susan was a very gracious host(ess)!  I turned up early due to a change in travel plans and she was very understanding and accommodating. As a self-sufficient', I keep entrances and exits pretty quiet and this was not a problem here (just don't forget to kick your shoes off!). Great location 2 or so blocks from the T. I would visit again."
232990,12241831,2014-04-27,11671564,Kimberly,Susan was very nice and her home was clean and comfortable.  The room was large and had all the comforts of home and fresh coffee I the morning was often accompanied by fresh baked goodies. I would definitely recommend for others to consider staying here.

My 3rd floor room was lovely- spotless and comfortable. The bathroom was very clean and shared among the 3 guests with no issues.,,,,,

I had nice homemade muesli everyday and the room was perfect for business and with a pleasant view to gardens. Susan leaving some chocolates for me to take back with me to Australia for my young boys was a really nice way to finish the trip, thanks Susan!"
232990,14213928,2014-06-14,15853136,Mihalj,"Susan was a lovely host. Freshly baked cookies and corn bread saved us from fast food dessert traps in the city. Thanx for that, Susan!"
The neighborhood is the only thing that keeps me from giving a full five star rating. Beautiful houses,but some creepy figures,especially on Dorchester Ave..,,,
Nevertheless,"a warm and pleasant house with some excellent breakfast...\"",,,,
232990,15677918,2014-07-14,14567144,Jesús,Susan is incredible. She was amazing during my stay. She was always trying to make me feel comfortable during the month I spent in Boston. She tried to make me feel as if I was in my own home. She bakes delicious goodies and cooks a tasty breakfast for all of her guests on Sundays. When I arrived to Susan's house she received me with a pitcher of water that refreshed me after I had arrived from my flight.

I can not stress how much I wish I were having breakfast at her table. Waking up to fresh fruit everyday can't be beat. The listing was so much more than I had expected. The neighborhood was clean, peaceful, and easy access to the Red Line meant that traveling through Boston was a breeze. I highly recommend Susan's bed and breakfast for a comfortable stay in \"\"The Bean.\"\" She"
232990,16233778,2014-07-23,18291947,Drew,"We are a couple of Australian travellers who have experienced numerous types of accommodations. As an introduction to AirB&B,Susan was excellent. She met us on our arrival and welcomed us in the lounge of her lovely house. She had placed an iced pitcher of water in our room to help us refresh. After discussing the house rules and what she provided (outstanding breakfast and be there for her weekend breakfasts), her home made muesli/granola is to die for. She has a young puppy who is absolutely lovely. The room was large and comfortable and the other guests when present were lovely."
232990,16594247,2014-07-29,16532923,Darren & Fleur,"This home is a lovely well kept home and it is evident Susan takes pride in both her house and her hosting. The small details were appreciated--lemonade upon our arrival, water in our room, homemade cookies for our son. Breakfast was delicious --it was great to enjoy fresh fruit and homemade pancakes--you can tell Susan is a talented cook. The location of Susan's home is ideal--a two min walk to the train and 15 min ride downtown."

232990,20548218,2014-10-01,3010577,Colin,"We loved our stay with Susan.  The house was clean, comfortable, well decorated, close to the subway line, and the breakfasts were great.  More important, Susan and Zoe (her dog) were so warm, caring, and helpful.  I stayed 2 months with Susan, and by the time I left we felt like family.  We were sad to leave."
Susan helped with all sorts of information,from jogging routes to places to see on Cape Cod,and was always ready to help when asked.   When our daughter left Boston from the bus station,Susan thought she had left her phone behind and drove frantically to the bus station downtown to bring us the phone.,,
Susan is very considerate of one's privacy,while making sure everyone knows the rules in the house.  This is important for all guests to enjoy the house,and a big PLUS for a B&B where up to 3 different families stay simultaneously.,,,
The house is extremely convenient on the Red subway line.  And there is no problem coming home even after midnight to the neighbourhood.  We felt very safe there.  The neighbourhood is also decorated with beautiful Victorian houses,"making the walk to and from the subway a pleasure.  Highly recommended.\"",,,,
232990,23237073,2014-11-26,20645651,Christopher,"This was my second experience staying with Susan.  This was an extended booking - Susan still welcomed me with open arms, helped carry my luggage to my room and was an overall wonderful host.  Due to this being an extended booking, we had multiple interactions over several months and I must say Susan (and her puppy Zoey) were a joy to speak with."
A former caterer,Susan's Sunday breakfasts were amazing,very filling and special (especially the French Toast and bacon!)  The bed itself was very comfortable,the bathroom sparkling,"and the house is a very  ascetically pleasing place and It would be my pleasure to stay their again!\"",
232990,28001326,2015-03-16,26636938,Beth,Susan’s Bed and Breakfast is a great deal .
First you have location.  It’s not located in the middle of Boston,but it is a very quick walk (around the corner and a half a block) to the subway red line which will get you anywhere quickly without having to worry about parking.,,,,
Second,Cleanliness.  Wow,this place is cleaner than any hotel I have stayed in.,,,
Third,the accommodations are comfortable.  Multiple pillows and a quality bed.  A clean hotel type robe in each room.  A desk,Full length mirror,hairdryer,shampoo,etc.  It's very well thought out.
Fourth,Susan is an all around good host with a wealth of knowledge about Boston and great places to go.,,,,
Fifth,the price is  extremely reasonable.,,,,
There are rules that you have to abide by in order for all guests to stay together comfortably.  If you are the type of person who wants to drink,get loud and put your feet up on the furniture then this is probably not the place for you.  Finally,you must love dogs because there is a sweet but rambunctious pup,"Zoe.  She knows she is not allowed in any guest bedrooms so she gets pretty excited when you come downstairs to \"\"just see her\"\".  It's nice if you are an animal lover to have a pet around while traveling.  If you give her belly rubs she will calm down.  So",all in all,"I would recommend Susan's place and would stay there again if I were to come back to visit Boston.\""

Susan coordinated with us ahead of our arrival in order to better prepare for our needs, and had cold water and snacks waiting for us when we got to the house. She is a great cook, too, and surprised us with delicious coffeecake on our last morning--even packing up the leftovers for us to take on the road with us.

Susan was very helpful,knowledgable and provided a lovely breakfast.,,,,
Zoe,the dog,was lovely too. She hugs you when she greets you and likes to play a as long as you show you're happy with it.,,,
We did get lost as our gps took us to 'the other' Allston street the Dorchester 'Allston street' wouldn't come up on our gps. We then had to wait for Susan to be ready as she is very busy but I suppose that's fair enough. Apparently this warning was written in our questionnaire but as we had been on the road for a while and booked very last minute during a wedding we didn't read everything as thoroughly as we could have. We also don't know the area. We didn't expect as much paperwork if honest.,,,,,
That said,if you like everything to be organised and just so with a delicious breakfast,then this is for you.,,,
"\"",,,,,
232990,51053126,2015-10-17,21365915,Sandra,Susan is a great host and I must confirm that all comments are correct: staying at her house is a good choice not only for having close access to downtown (red line) but also because you can have your privacy and that homemade granola in the morning :)

232990,52188498,2015-10-26,32169139,Kenneth,"Susan is a pro.  I would say one would be hard pressed to find any host as organized as she.  I did not take advantage of the breakfast only because I had to leave too early in the AM and had food at the conference.  Cozy, old multibedroom home.  The room had good heat.  Despite having multiple guests, my room was quiet and comfortable.  She introduced herself and took the time to get to know me and let me know about her."
232990,64207879,2016-03-01,52777862,Kushagra,"So we stayed at Susan's place for 5 weeks and over all it was an experience to remember , like a bitter sweet symphony."
Susan is a lovely lady who will at times go out of the way to make her guests feel welcomed. The listing is very clean and rooms have everything organized in order. Neighborhood may not be the best for traveling at night but it is super close to the subway,which made it very convenient. Zoe,her dog,is one of most affectionate dogs i've met and an absolute delight. The breakfast,particularly the homemade granola is to die for. Also,Susan went out of the way to bake lovely treats for us on the weekends.The accommodation has everything that one may need for a great stay and Susan was very professional and gave us good amount of privacy.
It is however important to know that you are living in someone's private space and there will be rules for everything you do right from the use of kitchen to bathroom,which make more sense in the long run but could make you feel uncomfortable at that time.The use of kitchen is limited,and it will harder if you plan to use it regularly for cooking. It would also be recommended for guests to stay outside (for work/ travel) during the day time.,,,
It was an enriching experience to stay with Susan both culturally and intellectually,and we had some great conversations.,,,,
If given an opportunity I would definitely like to stay there again.,,,,,

She is very professional and warmly hospitable. Her dog Zoe is lovely and also made us feel welcome. Her home is clean and orderly. Our room was clean and bright. The listing, for the price, seemed too good to be true...and it was. Exceptionally good value. The neighbourhood is AWESOME. I am disappointed that some reviewers speak of the neighborhood rather disparagingly. To us the neighborhood is full of character and creativity.  We felt safe there. We LOVED the easy access to the subway as well as free, unlimited street parking. I really can't say enough about this listing. This was my first Airbnb experience and I was not disappointed. If I ever return to Boston, I will most definitely stay with Susan."
232990,72646176,2016-05-04,23091536,Hussain,It was a nice place. There is a dog which you should be aware of if there are people with allergies :)
232990,74165232,2016-05-13,34679651,Mike,"To say myself and my 5yr old son felt safe and comfortable would be an understatement. Look no further for a place to stay. Super clean home, perfect location, and an amazing host who went above and beyond any expectations you could have. My son will be talking about Susan and Zoe for years to come!"
232990,80965061,2016-06-20,77482198,Sonali,"It was my first AirBnB experience, and I was really nervous on who we would end up with. My husband and I wanted to do a quick weekend getaway to Boston, and I did not want to spend a ludicrous amount on just hotel rooms when we would barely be in the room itself (trust me, they are pricey in Boston).  I looked into my price range and saw that Susan's place came up with the highest reviews, so we took a shot. What a GREAT experience we had! Susan was so welcoming, even when we came in late on Friday night and offered us snacks and conversation before showing us around her beautiful home. It was a very clean place, and everything was separate for the guests, which I liked."
Our room was on the 3rd floor in the attic and it was a very nice space- she even put fresh roses on the table alongside with some homemade pecan turtles! We slept great,and headed out for our adventure the next day. It was only a 3-4 minute walk to the station and we were able to squeeze in a lot that day since we did not have a long commute to the Freedom Trail and other things.,,,,
Susan does have a dog,Zoey,whom we absolutely loved. Don't worry about her following you around or be in your space- Zoey keeps to herself unless you invite her over.,,,
Susan also went up and beyond when we needed to print our boarding passes (Spirit charges you) as well as providing a few small things that I forgot that we needed,and it was something that I truly did appreciate.,,,,
"We are definitely going to be coming back and staying here on our next visit. \"",,,,,
4410142,23408069,2014-11-30,10721186,Kezia,We had a fantastic time staying in Boston in Petar's apartment. The apartment was big and comfortable and we really enjoyed using the fireplace in the cold Boston winter.
The location though was amazing and so close to everything! We could easily walk to Newbury and tremont st and the subway.,,,,,
Petar and Nina were lovely hosts and very warm people in general! They gave us tips about the area and were great at being in touch prior to us arriving.,,,,,
One small thing though was that the bathroom had not been properly cleaned and whilst it was liveable and fine,it is the one thing that could be improved.,,,,
"Thank you for a great stay though Petar and Nina! \"",,,,,
4410142,24795028,2015-01-02,20610718,Marina,"Although we did not meet Peetar, he was very responsive to our emails. The home was as described. The location was superb. Beautiful area and near public transportation."
4410142,25211665,2015-01-09,9912049,Myra,Petar's place is really well located ( 5 minutes from Back Bay Station) and spacious. The bed is really comfortable and soft towels were provided. I arrived late and someone was there to meet me on time. Great place to stay in Boston.

We had an incredibly comfortable stay, and the bed was one of the best beds we have ever slept on! It was also big enough to comfortably fit the three of us. Although Peter wasn't around, he was always checking up on us to see if we needed anything and is easily contactable by phone. His place is also near the T and is walking distance to downtown Boston, eg Newbury street. We would love to stay here again the next time we come to Boston!"
4410142,37253071,2015-07-05,6402103,Ashley,We enjoyed our stay at Petar's home. The location was great and it was very easy to get around. Petar was very accessible when we had questions.

4410142,44077016,2015-08-23,37228059,Jaclyn,"Petar was great at keeping in contact and made himself available to answer any questions. The 1 bedroom home really is in the perfect location in Boston, making it easy to walk to museums and historic sights. Nearby are lots of great restaurants and there are paid lots for parking ($35 for 24hrs). The king size bed was comfortable, and there was an AC window unit that kept the bedroom cool enough in the humid summertime. Just a fan for the living room area, which was fine. I didn't use the bathtub to bathe my little one because it was a bit dated, but the shower worked well enough. Overall a nice stay."
4410142,45029599,2015-08-30,35649850,Paola,"I stayed in Petar's house for a weekend and is absolutely perfectly located! The house is spacious, the master bed is huge and the couch hides a pretty comfortable bed! He was very nice in let us stay in 4 instead of three people and we had no problem in finding a comfortable place for everyone. I had a very good experience."
4410142,45337790,2015-09-01,42238886,Shangqian,The location is wonderful. My friends and I all enjoyed staying here. Petar is very helpful. He picked me up at the airport in order to help me get to his apartment as soon as possible. It's great to choose his apartment.

4410142,55264736,2015-11-29,48884924,Yuexi,"The apartment is so nice! It's really big and comfortable, especially the living room which full of sunshine in the daytime. The bedroom is so big and warm. The bed is also very large. Everything we needed is prepared. And the location is great. It's near the subway. Only 5 minutes to get the orange line.

The place itself is very quiet yet just 5 minutes from major subway green line E . Shopping is also on the way.  I would not like to have changed with one of the sterile luxury hotels downtown.  It was a great time.  Thanks a lot Dayo
6629929,44684321,2015-08-28,6378548,Shelley,"Dayo's place was just as nice as the photos, and the view was very nice to come home to. He was quite busy while we were visiting, but Dayo made us feel comfortable in his space."

6629929,68486716,2016-04-05,62772645,Sope,"I really enjoyed my stay at Dayo's apartment: the room was well prepared for guests and the listing description was accurate. The apartment was clean, well organized and beautifully decorated. The neighborhood is located on a hill, is quiet, and is within walking distance of public transportation. Due to our schedules, my guest and I only briefly interacted with Dayo during our stay. Overall, I would strongly recommend Dayo's apartment for individuals traveling to Boston."

I enjoyed being there because indoor space is surrounded of natural lighting and it is also well ventilated and with good views of Boston skyline.,,,,,
It is a quiet and safe zone to walk and its so easy to go to downtown,museum of fine arts,Isabella,Steward gardener museum,Science museum,prudential

6629929,81732763,2016-06-24,38372350,Marcel,Dayo has made my stay in Boston very comfortable. His place is perfectly situated in Boston near the Longwood facilities and he made me feel very welcome.
6629929,83135077,2016-07-01,72278210,Laura,"This is a clean, airy, newly renovated space.  Dayo was easy going and welcoming.  Very nice kitchen, bathroom and deck space.  The bedroom has a comfortable platform bed and Dayo had towels and a robe waiting for me.  The apartment is on a hill and on the third (top) floor.  During my visit in late June it was quite hot in the apartment at the end of the day.  There is a modern AC unit in the bedroom, however, and I could retreat that.  The apartment sufficiently cooled by morning to have breakfast in comfort.  All in I am very happy with my choice."
6629929,85049938,2016-07-10,38207363,Frank,"Dayo's room was exactly as described / photographed. The place was extremely clean, sunny, and well-kept, and it really felt like staying at a home away from home. The neighborhood was quiet and felt very safe even when I came in late at night.

It made me want to live there! Lol. The location is great for train access to downtown Boston. I must warn others that it is on a steep hill. If your legs and lungs are not in shape, it will be a struggle getting to the apartment from the train. I was there visiting a great friend of mine and it was a 10 second walk. I would recommend this place to others looking for an escape!"
6629929,93161007,2016-08-11,13793185,Linda And He Is Larry,My stay at Dayo's place was excellent. His apartment was clean and attractively furnished and he generously offers access to a well stocked fridge. He made my arrival very welcoming by staying up to greet me even though it was nearly midnight. I enjoyed our conversations and was made to feel completely at home in his home. I would happily  return on a future visit to Boston.

The apartment was also very close to Newbury with many restaurants and shops.  The apartment can comfortably fit 2-3 people.

La cocina es tal cual figura en las fotos y está muy bien equipada. En cuanto al baño, aunque pequeño, es muy moderno...y la ducha espectacular! Vale la pena destacar la increíble ubicación: es perfecta para ir caminando a todos los puntos de interés turístico y el barrio es realmente divino, hay un montón de tiendas y lugares para comer a pocas cuadras.

Nathan was very nice and went out of his way to be helpful.  Getting in was easy.  It's a great neighborhood with lots of shopping and good restaurants but the apartment is on a quiet block with a pleasant residential feel.  Easy walk to public transportation or to the Boston Gardens.  Highly recommend.

Would be helpful to note on the add that there are 68 steps (daughter counted) to the apartment as we had some heavy luggage (75# trunk from camp) to lug upstairs.  Overall great experience.  Great location1.
4377247,46164700,2015-09-08,5191261,Igor,"Nathan's apartment is located in the heart of Back Bay close to hustle and bustle of Newbury and Boylston streets, yet it is quiet so one can sleep at night with windows open weather permitting. if you have a lot of stuff to unload beware of steep climb to the 4th floor. When we arrived, bedsheets didn't feel like they were fresh. Even though the host assured us they were changed, we decided to launder them anyway. There is a nice free modern washer/dryer in the basement. On the plus side kitchen and bathroom are nicely upgraded with modern appliances, cabinets, etc. Wireless internet worked great. There is a nice library selection of books if one wants to spend a quiet evening after all day of activities. It is a comfortable place for a couple to spend a week or more in Boston."
4377247,48372116,2015-09-26,27744821,Jennifer,Fantastic location for exploring Boston.  Lovely bright apartment in a nice building.  Nathan responded quickly to all questions and checked in with us during our stay.
4377247,70668485,2016-04-19,31164772,Julia,"My friends and I stayed in Nathan's apartment for Boston Marathon weekend, and it was great! It's a very convenient location - only a few blocks from the marathon expo, the finish line, and a variety of great shops and restaurants. It was the perfect place to relax after a long day of sight-seeing (and running!). Nathan promptly responded to my texts and was easy to communicate with. I would definitely stay here again!"
4377247,73044517,2016-05-06,68510924,David,"\"My wife and I stayed for nearly a week as part of a brief sabbatical visit to Boston. It was \"\"perfect\"\" for us"
4377247,73278563,2016-05-08,49451987,Zach,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4377247,88421389,2016-07-24,6413604,Rebecca,"Super easy check in and check out process, conveniently located, great list of restaurant recommendations! Lots of stairs - wasn't a problem for us,but could be if you have heavy luggage."
4377247,91710067,2016-08-06,86219456,Yvonne,"Fantastic location, tastefully decorated and a charming feel to this apartment. This was my first Airbnb experience. Clean, but not spotless, it felt like home immediately, preferable to hotels with sterile, functional rooms with no atmosphere, which can be awful, especially for single travelers. Although I didn't eat in, just made tea in the mornings,the kitchen was well equipped. The bed was comfy. The shower was powerful, and so was the little hair dryer! The air conditioner was good to have as the weather was hot and humid. I had noted the stairs in the reviews so was not daunted, it's the fourth floor, after all. And so quiet. I had no need to commmunicate with Nathan during my stay, as the instructions were clear and concise. Thank you, Nathan, for your part in my Boston adventure. I hope to return to your lovely home sometime."
14104621,93964681,2016-08-14,49860637,Meagan,"\"Lindsay's apartment was perfect! Extremely clean and the location doesn't get any better in Boston! It was so cozy, it felt like home. We were in the heart of the North End/Little Italy and a short walk from the \"\"T\"\" and major historical sites! Lindsay communicated very quickly and was a great host. The only thing I will add is that the stairs are steep but it added to the charm and appeal of the apartment and neighborhood. I would stay at Lindsay's again in a heartbeat!\""
11922134,73126650,2016-05-07,22087152,Kyung Min,"This listing was okay - it served the purpose and accurate as the description. However, there were a few things that I thought could improve. The carpet was dirty, the comforter smelled like cigarettes and cups were dusty. And I think that visitors would find it helpful to have a little more toiletries in the bathroom such as toothpaste and soap. But Anthony was a great, kind host. He was willing to help with anything and we appreciate that. The location was great, too. There is public transportation nearby and the neighborhood seemed safe and quiet. This place could be a great listing with a few improvements!"
11922134,73493119,2016-05-08,33662795,Anna,Anthony's apartment was great. Prime location and had all of the necessities. Anthony was a great host- communicative and nice!
"\"",,,,,
11922134,74036977,2016-05-12,23883950,Neal,Great location in an lively area - perfect for what I needed which was a place to crash over night on a flying visit.
11922134,74403424,2016-05-15,47270013,Kajsa,"The host was very accommodating for us with the time that we got there to get us the keys. The apartment was exactly as described. The neighborhood was amazing. Very central area and walk able distance to tons of historical landmarks and to public transport. Lots of night life in the area as well. Was pretty quiet, walls are a little thin and could hear the neighbor's phone call, though that is expected when living in the city."
11922134,75068577,2016-05-18,67348363,Laurel,Anthony was so helpful! His space was perfect!
11922134,75368254,2016-05-21,71826948,Brian,Anthony was a great host and his place is in a good location with a lot in walking distance.
11922134,75582225,2016-05-22,59408941,Megan,"Anthony's rental was perfect for our short weekend trip and in such a great location! We walked almost everywhere due to it being in such a central location, and it was close to the T for any further distance travel we wanted to do."
We took a red eye and arrived WELL before check in time,but Anthiny was very accomodating. He let us check in our bags right away so that we could enjoy the day on the city without lugging them around. As for the rental itself,it was a good size for the two of us. The bed was confortable and the place was clean & organized. The walls seemed a little thin,and at times we could hear the neighbors (but this was very minimal & we didnt have any trouvle falling asleep).,,
All in all,"we would definitely return if we're back in the Boston area!\"",,,,
11922134,76592125,2016-05-28,67255204,Keith,"Anthony was very accommodating,  he also was very knowledgeable"
"Great area. \"",,,,,
11922134,76978351,2016-05-30,69739691,Gunnar,We came from New York by car and really appreciated Anthonys' flexibility in regards to check in time. We were able to keep in touch by phone and text messaging during our drive to coordinate the arrival in a good way.
The apartments location is excellent and Little Italy definitely lived up to the promises with all the restaurants nearby and only a few minutes walk to the center of Boston.,,,,,
"We can definitely recommend this apartment.\"",,,,,
11922134,77553146,2016-06-01,39694610,Camilla,Location was perfect given we were only in Boston for 24 hours - easy to get to everywhere we wanted to go! The apartment was great - just like the photos if not a bit nicer. Would definitely recommend!
11922134,77967945,2016-06-04,64554141,Lauren,"Great location, quiet at night and with Hanover street, Fanueil hall, the aquarium, etc all within a walking distance. Anthony was very helpful (lots of towels, held our bags the last day) and knowledgeable about the area. We enjoyed learning some history!"
11922134,78569819,2016-06-07,66336736,Karin,"We really enjoyed our stay in Boston. The location is excellent, so close to everything. Anthony was very accommodating and worked with us by holding our bags before check-in and after check-out due to our flight times. He was also quick to respond to texts."
11922134,78695668,2016-06-08,1932368,Denis,"Apartment is ok. Bathroom is a bit worn out. The hot tub regulator is a tricky one, spent 5 minutes to make it working. Location is great though, should you need to live in North End."
11922134,79108977,2016-06-11,35469102,Elise,"Anthonys apartment is in a nice part of Boston and he was very easy to deal with- he knows a lot about the area and has a good sense of humor. However, if you are a non-smoker this might not be the place for you, the apartment and bedding smelt strongly of cigarette smoke to the point where we struggled to sleep. Likewise, if you are travelling with young children who are crawling you might wish to look elsewhere as the apartment floors are rather unclean. Overall, good location and a nice host, but it wasn't the right place for us."
11922134,79655936,2016-06-13,65980319,Alessandra,"The location was perfect. We were close to everything. There was no air conditioning though as noted in the description. The apartment was outdated. Even though we did not meet him, we still got inside the apartment ok."
11922134,81140462,2016-06-21,77804749,Karen,Anthony was very accommodating and friendly to us.  He bent over backwards for our every need!  The apt was clean and inviting and located within the North End.  We are very greatful of the hospitality.
11922134,81746988,2016-06-24,20654175,Ralph,Great location.  Never met the host but we corresponded by text successfully.  good value.
11922134,81962230,2016-06-26,57344316,Wei,Anthony's place is as described. The host is very friendly.
11922134,82927268,2016-06-30,38070879,Todd,"It isn't pretty but a great location.  In the middle of plenty of history, great restaurants and nearby Haymarket T station.  The carpeting has seen better days.  Anthony was available, extremely helpful and his place has all the basic amenities.  Thanks Anthony!"
11922134,83362403,2016-07-02,66643045,Greg,This place is in the right location and is convenient to everything downtown including parking.  Working with Anthony was a breeze.  Amazing city...
11922134,83683066,2016-07-03,29401079,Roman,Anthony was very hospitable. The apartment was very central to all the action.
11922134,83877943,2016-07-04,63966293,Christina,The location of this place was very nice. Located walking distance from lots of places. Had no issues finding it or getting in. Tried to check in early but could not get a hold of host to do so. Had a great stay.
11922134,85303084,2016-07-11,19073073,Maria,Perfect location to discover Boston for the first time!
11922134,85993134,2016-07-14,33681382,Elda,"The location of the apartment was great. We mostly walked everywhere and only had to use Uber a handful of times. We didn't have to contact Anthony all that much, but when we did, he did a good job communicating promptly. As far as the apartment itself, the photos describe it well; it had all the basics you would need. If you are looking for a good price in a great location, with average cleanliness, then this will work great for you. If you are looking for a fancy and very clean apartment; this will not work for you."
11922134,87338982,2016-07-19,25408563,Christina,"We had a wonderful time in Boston. Anthony's apartment was in a fantastic location! We were able to walk the whole Freedom Trail, the aquarium, and to the T. The apartment itself was a little bare (exactly as pictured and explained) but provides all the basics for your stay. Anthony was easy to communicate with and we enjoyed our overall experience."
11922134,88279179,2016-07-23,8321167,Michael,Great area to stay. Nice neighbourhood one street away from little Italy. Apartment was perfect size for two individuals and had everything to get by
11922134,88864963,2016-07-25,85264300,Tomas,The appartment is in a great location and the host is very thoughtfull and knows a lot about the neighborhood.
11922134,89126742,2016-07-27,51665618,Ben,The apartment was amazing! It was so close to everything and allowed me and my friends to explore Downtown and Historic Boston while still being able to live near that area. We loved the place and loved our stay
11922134,89864774,2016-07-30,31404,Philippa,"Anthony's apartment is in a great location in the heart of the historic North End and close to the T-line, the Heritage trail and a short walk to the Aquarium. The air conditioning worked well which was great as the temperature was over 90 degrees every day!"
The beds were very comfortable too. It would have been good to have a bit more kitchen equipment and there does seem to be a problem with a smell of smoking - I wonder whether it comes from a neighbouring apartment through an air vent or something? But overall,"a very good place to stay - many thanks to Anthony and to your kind mother.\"",,,,
11922134,90112393,2016-07-31,4008979,John,"Staying at Anthony's North End apartment was a good experience. The location is fantastic, and Anthony was not only quick to respond to messages but let us check in almost two hours earlier than scheduled. The apartment is very basic (and could have been a little cleaner), but we slept well and it was very comfortable overall. Would definitely recommend for a quick visit to Boston."
11922134,90861058,2016-08-02,21327732,Thomas,Appartement très bien situé à Boston. Propre. Anthony est acceuillant et s'est rendu disponible pour notre arrivé. Très bon séjour.
"Very good.\"",,,,,
11922134,93117269,2016-08-11,53711969,Jessica,If you're looking for location this is a great spot! Anthony was very helpful with directions and suggestions....his dinner suggestion Il Panino was amazing such good food.  I'm highly sensitive to smells to and felt like our belongings had a distinct smell upon us leaving. Place is not the greatest for a toddler due to cleanliness but if you're just looking for somewhere to lay your head and are not particular on upkeep then it will be just fine. We really really loved the location and again Anthony was helpful.
11922134,94146486,2016-08-14,40719377,Ben,"The location was great walking distance to many restaurants, bars, sites, etc.  Anthony was very accommodating as well."
11922134,94965644,2016-08-17,17307015,Justine,Nice place to stay to visit Boston !
11922134,95286016,2016-08-19,89367111,Ally,"Anthony's place was very clean and cool; he had been sure to turn the AC on before we got there and set up the futon as a bed for our third guest. He was very flexible about our arrival time and even though he was busy when we arrived, made sure to check in on us a little bit later. Anthony himself was incredibly friendly and accomodating and his place is in excellent proximity to all the best Little Italy places and walking distance from Boston Commons too."
11922134,95462359,2016-08-19,57115546,Ben,"Room as advertised. Basic, clean and easy to get to. Local bakeries and restaurants were a big plus. Anthony was pleasant, helpful and very accommodating! Definitely recommend!"
12390027,74122056,2016-05-13,62453159,Curt,"Phenomenal location. So convenient, especially for any conferences in Copley Plaza Hotel. Steps from the Prudential Center. Clean one bedroom, nice kitchen and family room. All you need."
12390027,75279156,2016-05-20,10058241,Mark,"Lucian's place was perfect. I was at the Boston Marriott Copley for a conference, and the walk from Lucian's to the hotel was about 3 minutes. The couch and bed were comfortable, the dining room and table were great and I was able to work a bit at the desk. Next time I'm in the area, I'll definitely be staying here."
12390027,75723877,2016-05-22,413283,Courtney,"This booking was perfect for us, as we are pretty self-sufficient travelers. We had the whole place to ourselves. Lucian was very communicative throughout the process and gave us the info we needed to enter the apartment the day before our arrival."
The apartment is very clean and comfortable. There were extra towels and sheets in the closet if we needed them. And the location is awesome! It's in the middle of everything,yet,still on a quiet side street. A 20-minute walk to Fenway,and an even shorter walk to prime areas like Boylston and Newbury Streets.,,
"We’d definitely come back!\"",,,,,
12390027,76222147,2016-05-25,9094641,Ch,"It's spacious place in a half-underground apartment with internal views. It is very clean, with good and clean linen and towels but unit age is apparent on the restroom and roof painting. I might have been unlucky but internet was very slow."
12390027,76620904,2016-05-28,70289339,亦行,"地理位置优越,附近商业集中、而且离女儿即将上的东北大学很近,地铁站近在咫尺,非常方便,房间配套齐全,舒适安静,价格也合理"
12390027,77900370,2016-06-04,25376591,Vera,"The location is superb, close to T stations, groceries, Prudential shopping center, etc."
The room is quite clean,but a little bit of dull. It's semi-basement unit and we had to shop basic ingredients for breakfast (salt,oil,etc).,,
This is a little bit nitpicky,but using wifi required daily registration on a webpage. We stayed at the apt for 5 nights with multiple phones/tablets/laptops,"it's pretty exhausting. \"",,,
12390027,78506566,2016-06-07,68027271,Thang,Great host. Easy communication and very helpful. The place itself is in an excellent location. Thank you Lucian

I have issue with the net,someone from service department dropped in to fix it. They give us extra sheets,towels,"etc. Made sure we were comfortable. \"",,
12390027,81006150,2016-06-20,63958991,Nick,"Great spot, good area of the city, easy to get to most parts of the city from the location. Host was very responsive, had a small issue regarding codes to get in on one of the days however Lucian helped to fix this quickly."
12390027,81437821,2016-06-23,36162958,Steve,Lucian was great! Allowsd access early to the apartment and even helped me with city parking options. Great location as well. We walked to Fenway.
12390027,82927498,2016-06-30,30414893,Jordan,"This apartment is in a wonderful neighborhood - it was really cool staying there. The apartment is great, with the exception of the bathroom (it just really needs a remodel). Other than the bathroom (and lack of toilet paper upon my arrival - which Lucian remedied the next day after I said something), it is a great spot."
12390027,83136860,2016-07-01,80602385,Matthew,"The place is really good, they have tv, hot water, kitchen (and they provide utensils for you) the room is clean, and they provide with extra blankets and pillows. Overall is a very good expiriences."
12390027,90156271,2016-07-31,14461227,Hui,"房间的地理位置非常卓越,在整个中心地带,Back Bay (后湾),非常宁静和安全的住宅区,步行可以到任何重要的景区,周边可选的购物饮食地也多,地铁也非常方便,叫Uber价格也不贵,不需要租车或开车。"
和房东的邮件互动非常顺畅。在抵达住所之前,房东关照入住事宜。当通知房东吸尘器无法工作时,房东第二日就出现了。,,,
房间是半地下室,白天也需要灯光,但是租价也很合理。厨房里厨具齐全,煮饭也方便,只是洗碗机有一点陈旧。总之夫妻2人居家舒适,我们住了1个月
12390027,91187710,2016-08-04,52255295,Fran,Clean and well-managed garden-level apartment in superb location.
12390027,92504261,2016-08-08,75034696,Andrea,"Stayed here for a conference at the neighboring Marriott, and the location couldn't have been better! The neighborhood was nice, with many well-regarded restaurants and bars nearby (plus a large mall for anyone who loves shopping). The apartment was great other than the bathroom, which needs a remodel (as others have mentioned)."
"Lucian was very responsive to all messages and requests. It was a great place to stay!\"",,,,,
12390027,95375599,2016-08-19,3533432,Jayme,"Great communication with the host from start to finish! Easy access to the apt all digital codes! Apt was super cool, air conditioned, modern and spacious. Lovely building. Felt like a real local! Great spot to be in. Walking distance to Boston Common and other main tourist sites. Lots of food and supermarkets around the area!"
"Would stay again :)\"",,,,,
12390027,97877921,2016-08-28,55365861,Oktay,Lucian was very cooperable. The location is excellent. The speed of internet was slow.
979759,3792740,2013-03-15,4461483,Jovan,"Great Host, Seamless is also a great company to accommodate your time frame needs no matter what it is.  I booked through seamless my whole entire weekly stays as I was moving over to my new apartment."
979759,11957215,2014-04-20,12559525,Sean,"I enjoyed my stay here, it was in a good location and easily accessible. It was also very clean and the beds were very comfortable."
A few things though:,,,,,
1) - The picture of the apartment was not the apartment that I stayed in,,,,,
2) - The apartment was a little bit under-furnished so it felt a bit empty,,,,,
3) - The address was actually 1 Emerson,not 10 Emerson,,,,
4) - There weren't enough towels in the apartment for a two week stay,,,,,
5) - I didn't receive any up-to-date information about checking-in,where I could leave my bags,who I should talk to to actually get into the apartment - after I had paid for the apartment.,,,
6) - I'm not sure if it was me and my own ineptitude,but I couldn't get the TV to work,and it looked like there was no way of getting it to work either.,,,
All in all though,"it was nice and pleasant.\"",,,,
12986016,82525794,2016-06-28,60079253,Jason Zi Yue,Nice host with lots of options in Boston.
4792901,44547759,2015-08-27,37360765,Brenda,"Rob is a kind person. His hospitality made me feel like I was in my own home, he also cooked meals when I got back late from school. You can also enjoy his music while he's practicing his bass, he will offers you a delightful serenade I am sure!  I miss you Rob!"
4792901,46035834,2015-09-07,3762176,Rachel,"This place is definitely spacious and had all the essentials we needed. Although we didn't get to meet Robert, his housemate was able to suggest some great local spots. It's pretty close to the downtown Boston, an easy $7 uber."
10033715,76641877,2016-05-28,73253918,Huicheng,Everything is good.
5526514,27625641,2015-03-08,28134232,Dylan,"Host was accessible and accommodating, as well as flexible with the price off season ;) Fort Hill Inn beats any Boston hotel I've stayed out and I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Real helpful for a first time airbnb user too!"
5526514,31181869,2015-05-03,28685438,Reagan,"Terry was very hospitable and welcoming. The apartment was very spacious and comfortable and it was easy to check in and check out. The only complaint is that we were unaware that we were staying in one of the more dangerous areas of Boston. We didn't have a problem, as we took uber to and from everything and felt safe. But, as we were just two girls traveling, I'm not sure that I would have stayed in the same area knowing what I know now. But, if you're comfortable with the location, the apartment was great!"
5526514,32782659,2015-05-21,3509735,Julie,"This place is just perfect! Super clan, quiet and very cute appartement! We went everywere by walk, it's pretty close the the center we really  appreciate it! Excellent value, if a come back to Boston, I will defenitly stay at your place again Terry"
5526514,33576662,2015-05-30,13660159,Samantha,"Terry reached out in advance to ensure that we had all the information we needed to get into the apartment, find a parking spot, etc. The apartment itself was very clean, well maintained, and comfortable. It had all the amenities of a hotel and more, considering that there is a full kitchen. I also would disagree with an earlier review in that this area IS safe. My family and I felt comfortable staying in this area and walking to and from the T stop. I should add that it's a very brief walk. The apt is great and I would recommend it to others! It's a steal of a deal."
5526514,34025864,2015-06-03,27648250,Derek,"Our stay was great. Easy to find, easy to access, very clean, and had all the amenities we wanted. It was in close proximity to everything.  Lots within walking distance or a short Uber ride would get you almost anywhere in the city. Terry was great and personally stopped by to greet us and ensure we had everything we needed."
5526514,34300469,2015-06-07,30793610,Rob,"Three friends and I came to Boston for our 4th annual baseball trip from June 3-7. We had great time and were very pleased with the apartment. We are a group of 4 big guys, and the apartment did not feel small at all. The bed and pullout hold 4 easily, but there is also room for 1 or 2 air matresses as well so sleeping room wasn't a problem."
The location was very convenient to hop on the Orange subway line which took us everywhere we wanted. We got the week Link Pass which was great so we could jump on and of the subway as many times as we wanted.,,,,,
The kitchen in the apartment was very nice,all the appliances you might need. Bathroom and shower were good as well. Our only complaint would be the internet,it was slow and consistently dropped when the 4 of us were on WiFi at the same time. When it was only one or two people,it worked better,but was still a little slow. We mentioned it to Terry on our first day and he came over and talked to us right away which was very nice of him. We actually noticed an improvement when we moved it out of the cast iron lamp table which we thought may have been creating a dead zone because of the metal surrounding it.,
Overall,"we had a great time and would definitely stay here again on another trip to Boston.\"",,,,
5526514,34703674,2015-06-11,5675831,Carol,"We enjoyed our visit at Terry's apartment. It is spacious and well appointed! Loved the wood floors,modern kitchen and air conditioning! Carlos greeted us and let us move our things in before 3:00, which we appreciated. The walk to the T was short - less than 10 minutes."
The Internet was fine during the day but VERY slow in the evening plus there was no cable TV as advertised.,,,,,
"Thanks Terry!\"",,,,,
5526514,40611513,2015-08-01,26451108,Karen,"The listing was accurate and we enjoyed our stay at this lovely apartment.  We did not meet the Host, though he gave us very specific directions as to the location of the apartment, key access, parking and nearby transportation via the Subway.  The apartment was clean, attractive and very comfortable.  We were a party of four adults and the sleeping arrangements were accommodating to both couples.  The apartment has been updated in a tasteful and attractive manner and is in a nice, old home.  Our only negative was that the weather was extremely hot and humid and the air condition unit was not sufficient to keep the apartment cool while sleeping at night."
5526514,42479060,2015-08-13,40689996,Spencer,"Despite not being able to use the sleeper sofa the first night because it couldn't be pulled out, we enjoyed our stay.  Terry was accommodating and came the next day to fix the sofa.  The place is a loft and so don’t expect a lot of space; however, the space is very usable because the furniture selection and placement is very well thought out.  Also, we didn’t need a car because this place was within a 5 minute walk to the T.  Nice place, Terry.  We would love to stay there again in the future."
5526514,42867279,2015-08-16,34731501,Haitham,"We had a great three nights' stay with Terry. My mother and sister got there first, flying in from Germany. They had no trouble finding the place and getting in after a long flight. It is very nicely appointed, clean, quiet and extremely comfortable. I joined a day later and had an exceedingly comfortable stay on the sleeper sofa. The location, while not central, is very easily accessible and all the sights are within easy reach/commute. The neighborhood is gentrified/gentrifying. We felt safe and comfortable. Parking was great. Definitely would recommend to stay with Terry!"
5526514,43499211,2015-08-20,31518824,Andreas,It is a very nice flat with slide problems with the extra bed. Terry was very helpfull to solve the problem.  We had a good Time.
5526514,45468621,2015-09-03,35464283,Danylo,"Staying at Terry's place was great, he was very kind, and always responded to my phone calls, answering every question I had."
All in all,"beautiful apartment!\"",,,,
5526514,50086493,2015-10-09,41016425,Jens,We had a very nice stay with Terry in Boston. The appartment is beautiful and charming. Absolutly fitting and comfortable for us two.
On our first day we had the chance to meet Terry in person. He was very kind and helpful. Absolutly recomend to have a chat we him in the beginning when you are in Boston for the first time. He gave us a headstart with many useful tips.,,,,,
"Thanks!\"",,,,,
5526514,52504496,2015-10-30,7503721,Daniel,"We had a wonderful time at Terry's place. We got there by car and there was plenty of parking space in the street near by. The apartment was really neat and spacious. The only problem was the wifi. The one Terry recommand to use is not working properly. So we asked the one renting the apartment below and they gave us a wifi that was working well. We were 4 males and both the bed and sofa bed were really comfy. Moreover, you have everything you need to cook! We didnt get to meet Terry unfortunatly. (Exept reallt briefly while we were making a bit too much noise). I really recommand this place!"
5526514,59088349,2016-01-06,51582944,Victor,"Very nice and comfy apartment, near subway line. We had everything we needed for our stay."
5526514,59592604,2016-01-12,7952778,Maggie,Terry was a great host - he waited to greet me outside and show me in even though I arrived late at night.  He showed me a map and explained how to get to the subway and where I needed to go.
The apartment was a beautiful and spacious studio - well decorated,comfortable,and with Boston charm.  There is a spacious kitchen which may be useful because there are not a ton of food options in the immediate area.,,,
The neighborhood was quiet and residential.  The T station is less than a 5 minutes walk away,and Uber taxis were also an easy and affordable option.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5526514,60141197,2016-01-19,51961389,George,The apartment was what we thought it would be.
Clean,fresh and well put. All the amenities were available and the keyless system was great.,,,,
A few issues were some technical difficulties with the detailing.,,,,,
The water pressure was very low,the gas fireplace did not have instructions to operate it (considering the interface was loose and non-user friendly). And there was a cold draft from multiple spots in the apartment. And the Bose sound system didn't seem to work while the internet was also sparse.,,,,
Apart from those few things,it was a great location. The quality was very good and we would very much recommend Terry's place!,,,,
We should note that we had made a mistake with our reservation plans and mistook our check-out day for our last night there.,,,,,
Terry was very understanding and we hope it didn't disrupt his plans too much.,,,,,
Thanks Terry,despite the little hiccup at the end!,,,,
"Good luck :)\"",,,,,
5526514,61579918,2016-02-06,34388957,Miguel,Cozy and comfortable!.. Convenient location ... Great stay..highly recommend !
5526514,62813591,2016-02-17,24345277,Natalie,"Our one week stay coming from the West Coast with completely opposite weather was a very interesting experience. Terry was very accommodating. We wanted to know about the heating system and Terry came over and answered our questions and even increased the heat incase we needed it. The location is perfect, very close to transit. The decor of the apartment was very cute and we made great use of the bubble bath tub. Thank you Terry! Until next time, from San Francisco."
5526514,66097730,2016-03-19,61806420,Heather,I had a great time staying at this Airbnb! The first morning there was construction noise that woke me up but Terry did amazing job of accommodating me in a unit across the street and gave me a discount. He was very kind and extremely helpful the whole time. I would definitely rent with him again and would recommend him as a great host!
5526514,69275230,2016-04-10,7683437,Leya,"Terry was very prompt in his response and also available over the phone when we had questions during our stay. The apartment was as per the pictures, cosy, clean and comfortable.  Situated in a relatively quiet neighbourhood, the apartment is a short walk from the nearest T station, less than 10 mins stroll away. Back Bay is a few stops away, so it's quite convenient. We used the washing machine, dryer and the kitchen for some light cooking during our stay. There is detergent, dishwashing liquid available, and it felt like a home away from home. Slight matters to take note of for the apartment: wifi can be weak at times, especially at night; water pressure in the bathroom is weak, so cannot enjoy the shower thoroughly but serves its purpose. it is also not recommended to take a bath because it would take up all the available hot water and one would need wait around 20 - 30 mins for the water to heat up again. There is no peephole to the main door of the apartment and there is also not much closet space to hang clothes."
Heating in the apartment was good and we felt warm and toasty most of the time,"except some spots in the apartment had a cold wind draft.\"",,,,
5526514,70693256,2016-04-19,50940538,Lisa,"We were in town for the Boston Marathon and our stay was wonderful! The apartment was clean and spacious and the t-station was nice and close, which made it easy to get around. Terry was quick to address any questions we had. I would definitely recommend staying here! Thanks for having us, Terry!"
5526514,72356407,2016-05-02,65881332,Anoop,The loft was everything we needed and more. We booked this extremely last minute so we could make a surgery at Boston Children's and Terry helped us through our first AirBNB Experience through our mad rush to find a place. He was always responsive when we needed him and we extended our visit when we needed to stay longer than needed due to minor complications.
The apartment was beautifully furnished and there was a welcome folder with local menus and suggested places that would definitely help those not familiar with the area.,,,,,
Parking could maybe be an issue in theory,"but I always found a spot within a 2 minute walk over the course of 8 days and never worried about the walk regardless of the time of night. The area is well lit and safe.\"",,,,
5526514,75900303,2016-05-23,53071025,Helen,"We had a great stay in this apartment. We didn't actually meet Terry as we had no issues while staying there, there was information left out for us about the area which was useful. The apartment is lovely! Very clean, fresh towels, comfy bed."
The area felt a bit dodgy at night time around the station but we didn't have any problems and the street the house is on was fine. A short walk to the station meant we got into Boston really easily - we even walked into the city centre one sunny morning which was really straightforward too.,,,,,
Overall a great apartment,"I would definitely recommend. \"",,,,
5526514,92487781,2016-08-08,57124836,Daniel,Everything was perfect and extremely easy with Terry! Would highly recommend to stay here.
3730447,17324802,2014-08-10,19414595,Brandon,"The listing matched the photos well, and Andrew (Drew) was pro-active in providing key drop location and his contact information.  He reached out to me via email and text to make sure I had this information easily accessible (without me asking!).  He called me back immediately the one time I reached out. He was a great host."
The neighborhood is quiet,and the proximity to the T was a big advantage for us. There is a nice little park across the way (with activities for children and adults),and good pizza and a bakery are nearby.,,,
The guest bed was very comfortable,with a variety of pillows from which to choose.  Even though the guest room had no A/C,it had a quiet-yet-powerful oscillating floor fan that kept the room comfortable on a 75 degree night.,,,
The kitchen was well-suited for cooking. There's both a set of seasoned/used cast iron pans and a french press for those that are serious about food preparation!,,,,,
I would guess that,however,we may have been the first (or amongst the first) guests to have stayed in this condo.  There are some nitpicks and genuine issues that are generally addressed very quickly when having frequent guests.  I will list them here not with the expectation that someone should be scared off,but rather with the understanding that if they are not addressed soon,only then should it serve as a warning.,
1- The key to the condo was very difficult to work. Just as I was calling Drew,we got in. I had more difficulty with it the next morning when locking up,but again,it worked.  There seems to be a trick to it,and it got easier the more I fiddled.,
2- Cleanliness.  I felt the condo was clean enough to 'live in',but not quite clean enough for guests.  The apartment smelled strongly of the last meal that was cooked (smelled good to me,but not to the other guest with me). The blinds were dirty and needed a good cleaning. The shower curtain liner had a lot of mold and mildew at the bottom.  The last is the one that stuck out the most.  My friend that was with me was a little more sensitive to this than I was (allergies),and could not shower.,,
3- The blinds in the living room are not very usable,and could do with being replaced. One fixture was broken (and that window was uncovered). I only mention this,because the listing suggests that the couch can accommodate one person. Without the blinds,there is not a lot of privacy to the outside world.,,
Overall,I would recommend this listing to anyone,so long as those three items are addressed (or if they're unimportant to you).  Drew obviously cares about the quality of stay for his guests,"and his condo only has a little way to go before it's a gem.\"",,
3730447,17887138,2014-08-18,4328332,Chandeerah,The apartment was beautiful. Extremely clean and well accomodated. Fully stocked kitchen. Great beds! Nice living room. Conveniently located.
3730447,19551447,2014-09-14,19260919,Cameron,"Drew's place was very cozy with plenty of room. The orange line was less than 10 minute walk from the door and the neighborhood feels welcoming. Drew communicated well and was flexible with our plans. They also made you feel welcome in their home. Two things to point out. They do not own a tv, so plan accordingly. Also, the bathroom could have used a deep scrubbing (though it is their home, not a hotel!). Overall we enjoyed a very nice experience and I would recommend you give them a look."
3730447,20348949,2014-09-28,8290694,Anne,Andrew's apartment is amazing and super cosy! We loved it from the beginning especially the residential neighborhood is nice and enjoyable plus you are in the city within 15 min.
3730447,21220553,2014-10-13,20581872,Philippe,"L'appartement de Andrew et Caith était très chaleureux. Nous nous sommes immédiatement sentis comme à la maison. Les lits sont très confortables et la cuisine est bien équipée. Andrew avait pris la peine d'écrire un petit guide pratique pour apprivoiser le quartier Jamaica Plain. Malheureusement, nous n'avons pas eu la chance de nous rencontrer en personne."
"Première expérience de Airbnb très satisfaisante!\"",,,,,
3730447,22254718,2014-11-02,943448,Grace,Drew was a great host! He him gave us very thorough instructions to get the keys and had everything all set for us! Super cozy place and clean :) and very convenient to get into Boston - parking was also not a problem at the apartment :)
3730447,24833153,2015-01-03,358245,Suzanne,"Andrews place was just great,quiet,clean directly across from parks am a few blocks from the T. I just wish the weather had been nice enough to enjoy the porches."
3730447,30274708,2015-04-20,22370032,Jimmy,"The apartment was amazing, neighborhood cozy, and the location is close to the T. You can go to downtown Boston around 25 minutes. The apartment was quite spacious and had plenty of outdoor seating areas. Andrew is pretty quick to respond to any questions, and he did a good job with house details(keys, wifi, etc)."
3730447,31194384,2015-05-03,29535918,Bryan,"Andrew was waiting when we drove up and he was polite and attentive - he let us in, showed us around, answered a few questions and promptly left. The place was perfect for our needs - very comfortable, quiet and convenient to downtown (the 'T' is a 10 minute walk) and the arboretum (15 minute walk) is absolutely beautiful this time of year! The weather was a bit too chilly to really enjoy the porches but I can see where they may actually be a highlight of the place when its warmer. The apartment had everything we needed and we couldn't be happier with the accommodations... Thanks Andrew!"
3730447,32326086,2015-05-17,28189690,Scott,"We had a great weekend stay , the apartment was comfortable and clean , the neighborhood is quiet and parking was easy. Our hosts were very accommodating and met us earlier in the day so we could get on to our event."
3730447,32544973,2015-05-19,26648085,Brie,The host canceled this reservation 65 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3730447,33265404,2015-05-26,31303723,Lisa,"Drew was great!  We coordinated a time and just met at the apartment.  he and his partner showed us around - she even shared her paper with our 3 yr old son who was very excited to be there!  There was a great energy about the place - just really relaxing and calm.  The front sitting area was great - cool breeze, sunshine in the morning!  Best reading material ever!!  Easy access to the city - T is a short walk down the hill.  Great for kids - there's a playground right across the street!  We would definitely recommend the spot and return ourselves."
3730447,33657137,2015-05-31,4375618,Katharine,Had a great stay! Place was awesome and Andrew was a great host.  He met us and went over all the basics and even left us some delicious homemade pickles! The apartment is very close to public transportation and it was very easy to get to and from all the things we wanted to do in Boston.
3730447,35132987,2015-06-15,34213835,Nancy,The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable. We had everything we needed. Drew made it easy. We had a great weekend and are happy we stayed there.
3730447,38578965,2015-07-17,22287751,Carina,The apartment was perfect for our family vacation in Boston. A lot of space even with 3 kids and two adults and we felt very much at home. It's a 10 minutes walk from Forest Hills station and very easy to get to the center of Boston. Across the street there's a playground and a ballpark. Friendly people in the building. Andrew was very helpful and answered any question we had. We would definitely stay here again. Also the pizzas at Forest Hills pizza are very good.
3730447,38819268,2015-07-19,13388040,Juli,"This place is wonderful. It's a beautiful, comfortable space on a quiet street in a rad neighborhood. Everything that the description says is true, so night owls should probably find another space - this one is pretty quiet. It gets hot when the Boston weather is 90 degrees since air conditioning is only in one bedroom. Other than that, this place is stellar."
3730447,41317452,2015-08-07,17581487,Kristiane,Andrew war unkompliziert und hilfsbereit. Die Wohnung hat eine super komfortable Lage und ist sehr gemütlich. Andrew hat eine Zusammenfassung mit Tipps zur Nutzung der Wohnung und der Umgebung vorbereitet. Wir würden jederzeit wieder kommen.
3730447,46005623,2015-09-07,27614813,Ashley,"Staying at Andrew's apartment in JP was great!  He met us at the beginning and was great to be in contact with beforehand. It was easy to get to the t stop. We were able to walk easily to the arboretum, which was beautiful. The apartment was large and clean. We were able to stay there comfortably with our infant son."
3730447,48547807,2015-09-27,19476426,Lauren,"We enjoyed our stay at Andrew's place in the cute neighborhood of Jamaica Plains. His 2 bedroom apartment is walking distance to the Forest Hill's subway stop, which is super convenient. Very much appreciate that he let us bring our 2 small dogs."
3730447,50508928,2015-10-12,44457246,Jean,"What a lovely apartment! Beautiful, sun-filled living area; gleaming wood floors; and Andrew & Cait even left a vase of flowers on the coffee table for us. Beds were super-comfortable. The perfect place if you want to be in a quiet home on a quiet street, where you really feel like a part of the neighborhood ... but still be a 5-minute walk from the orange line which takes you right into all the downtown Boston attractions. The same 5- to 10-minute walk also takes you to a grocery store (in case you want to enjoy a meal in your hosts' well-equipped kitchen) and several restaurants, cafes, and bars (if you prefer to eat and drink elsewhere). I can't imagine a better inaugural Airbnb experience and can't wait to come back!"
3730447,51990703,2015-10-25,8822674,Randy,"Overall, the apartment was great. Nice location, lots of bars and restaurants nearby. Near the arboretum. The only issue I had was that this is a condo located on the second floor. I had issues one night as you can hear the neighbors above you walking around. It happened after midnight. If you are not a sound sleeper, this may be an issue. Also, neighbors were not as friendly at first but eventually became welcoming as soon as they found out i was staying the weekend. However, I knew this coming in so I can't complain. Other than that, Parking was a breeze, near Boston and pet owners could bring their dogs to the park located across from the apartment. Highly recommended for pet owners and/or others with no transportation."

Andrew was incredibly helpful in the planning stages, providing all of the needed information upfront and accommodating our arrival and departure times.  All in all, a wonderful experience!"
3730447,73337500,2016-05-08,12930816,Sam,"Great apartment; great host; great location.    Apartment is better than described and depicted: 2 large bedrooms, living room and dining room, large kitchen.   It's on the second floor of an older 3-decker apartment building, but it's really attractive.   And it's very accessible to the Orange Line, which can connect you to everything in downtown Boston and much of Cambridge.   Drew and Cait were very helpful and communicative.   We enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again."
3730447,77073547,2016-05-30,13858972,Jamie,Listing was accurate and a great location.  Would definitely recommend staying here!
3730447,81182213,2016-06-21,47934944,Laura,"A great space, open, airy and spacious.  Andrew was a very helpful host, responding to me as soon as I reached out. Entry and exit were very easy;  we brought our dog, Ella and it was a good place for her as there was a park right across the street.  Also, parking was very easy."
3730447,86888014,2016-07-17,1674661,Penney,"House was certainly cozy and comfortable, a great location and plenty of space (we had 2 adults and 3 kids).  Bedding,towels, and sheets were clean, host was responsive to questions and comments, including when we inquired about the adequacy of the ACs in the house.  He was also a cordial and friendly host when he came by to water his garden, sharing tips and info with our children. Apartment mostly was as pictured in photos. It was extremely hot during our stay but the 2 AC units (in living room and master BR, but not in 2nd BR) kept the house cool.  A great value for the city and location."
The big problem for us was the lack of cleanliness.  It wasn't filthy and had been cleaned,but just not thoroughly or properly cleaned.  There was dust and/or grime on the floors (outside major walkways),baseboards,kitchen walls,under bed,and around toilet in bathroom.  There were dirty pans in the stove and the refrigerator was frat-house level dirty.  Distinct but not overwhelming dog odors on couch and cushions
Overall good size apartment and good value for location.  We wouldn't stay there again due to cleanliness and if you saw the photos we took of the dirty areas in the apartment,you would probably not want to stay there either.  If host got it professionally cleaned every month or so (not necessarily after each guest),"it would be a good place to stay.\"",,,

3730447,92723591,2016-08-09,27378032,Veronica,"Fantastic place, great neighborhood, super convenient location. A wonderful home full of books and no TV! Only issue was the second floor location. Our seven year old girl, though well behaved, skips instead of (URL HIDDEN) the kitchen, to the restroom, to the living room. This made our stay a bit stressful as our first floor neighbors expected silence. Other than that, great place to stay."

4177233,20269846,2014-09-26,20820583,John,"Staying with John was the smartest move of my entire Boston trip! He was extremely accommodating (even created a map to help me navigate a tricky train station) and welcoming (no better way to experience Boston culture than a cold beverage with a true Irishman!).  The room was perfect: quiet, clean and a short walk from the T (not far, but probably wouldn't recommend a rolling bag).  John was very responsive & communicative--he is a true asset to the Airbnb community."
4177233,20585539,2014-10-01,21301070,Charlotte,"Staying with John was great we felt incredibly welcome. The room was immaculate and comfortable, we loved sitting on his balconies with our breakfast or tea and would definitely come back to stay if he'd have us! Great area too very convenient. Local diner 'Victorias diner' does the best burgers and cake give it a try of you're there"
4177233,20785268,2014-10-05,11949442,Stephanie,"We just returned from a weekend trip to Boston and I must say John was a phenomenal host! His apartment was very well kept, clean, and put together. The room was perfect. He provided towels, a huge map of Boston on the wall, and some travel books for information. John even provided us with detailed and mapped out directions on how to get to his apartment from the T station (which was only a 5min walk). He pointed us in the direction of good restaurants in the area as well. It is an ideal location for visiting downtown Boston and the neighborhood overall is pleasant. We had an incredible experience and would definitely like to consider this accommodation for future trips to Boston. Thanks John!"

4177233,21235807,2014-10-13,2585062,Shari,John was a great host. He was sitting on the front porch waiting for us since his doorbell didn't work and we hadn't received his message stating that. It's a good thing we were only 10 minutes late from our stated arrival time. I had told John I needed to find a place to buy our 7 day transit passes and he offered to get them for us so they were waiting for us when we arrived.

4177233,21500706,2014-10-18,22571579,Juston,John was a great host and he made my first airbnb experience exceptional.

4177233,21978293,2014-10-27,22143694,Julia,I really enjoyed my stay at John's. He made me feel very welcome. It was very nice to spend time at home. The room I was staying in was very cosy and quiet. The location of the house is convenient - being close to the subway and in a nice neighbourhood. John was a great host and I really appreciate that he chose to share his flat and time with me. I hope that next time we will get a chance to have morning coffee together at one of the terraces. I recommend staying at John's while visiting Boston!

The apartment is very close to the red line, so it was easy to get in and out of Boston.  There was also plenty of free street parking, so we had no trouble parking our car nearby.

In terms of location, it is not super convinient to downtown and all the tourist places but the subway helps a lot. UBER is another great choice. Make sure you try McKenna cafe on Savin hill, which is about 10 minutes walk from the apartment. The food is great!"

4177233,35104952,2015-06-15,2308777,Joanna,"I had a great stay at John's. It's less than ten minutes to walk to the red line, though I took a cab home at night because I felt a little iffy as a woman walking alone in the neighborhood. Less than $10 to Uber from downtown. John was super welcoming and accommodating. It is a fairly small space, so when we were both there, there's no real noise barrier with the living room or bathroom and the floors are super creaky. Not a huge deal for me, and John was really respectful, but just worth noting. Overall, it's a good deal in an expensive city!"
4177233,35453899,2015-06-19,4740853,Allison,"John was very communicative during the reservation process and the day of our arrival. We didn't see him during our two night stay.

The apartment is in such a convenient place, literally a 5 minute walk to the T stop and then a 10 minute commute into the centre of Boston.

The flat itself is clean,tidy and comfortable! Unfortunately I didn't get to meet John at first cause he happened to be away for those days but everything was smooth and easy! And I have to say there is a balcony right outside the door and you can have the street view which was very chilled after a day out!,,,,

Our host Javier was very accommodating.  He responded very promptly to our request. He was awesome! He made sure we're safe. Told us the ins and outs of the city.  Places to eat and go. Showed us great hospitality. Thank you very much Javier! The only thing I probably would have complained is that we had a private room and there was 4 of us total in the condo. We all had different schedules and we were adjacent to the restroom so we can hear the water different times in the morning, so sleeping straight was kind of rough..we didn't get much. Overall the condo was very nice and clean."

He was really helpful and sent detailed notes on getting in as we didn't meet in person,but gave me tips by SMS during the weekend when I had a question. So a really good host even in remote mode.,,,,
There are not too many places to eat out in the neighbourhood so don't count on walking to many cafes,but Telegraph Hill is a pub with good food,nice staff etc and less than 10 minutes on foot,and there is at least one good pizza takeaway in the same direction. We only tried one. Lots of restaurants just one stop away on the T. So you have choices.,,
The seaside is a few minutes in one direction the Red Line in the other,a taxi was $10-$12 into the centre so overall a pretty good spot.,,,,
Very comfortable,nice to look at and easy to get to.,,,,

5078127,38181073,2015-07-13,36622564,William,Comfortable. Convenient. Classy. Chic. These are the words that fit this place!
I loved Dylan's and Chris' condo. It was exactly as advertised. Truly a home away from home. Tastefully decorated and charming. The condo has great beds and well-appointed baths. The kitchen is a cook's delight. Just a couple of blocks to Andrew Square and the T. Being close-in also meant short rides with Uber to the best of Boston. I didn't use the fireplace although I flipped it on to see the great ambiance. What I did use was the AC because it was in a July heat wave. The AC is strong and made for some great sleeping.,,,,,
The check-in information provided was well organized and answered virtually all of my questions. When I needed some extra direction,Dylan was quickly accessible by text.,,,,

Our favorite part definitely had to be the roof deck where we spent all our nights lounging and watching the sunset. From the roof we had a gorgeous view of downtown Boston and Southie. Dylan and Chris left meticulous instructions that explained everything from how to turn on their fireplace, how to use their coffee machine, where all the best restaurants and bars were, to how to walk to the T station. Speaking of the T, another aspect that we really loved about this condo was its close proximity to Andrew Station. Parking in Boston can get pretty expensive and so we decided to take the T and it was wonderful having the red line so close to us.

We loved the location right next to a Church and the rooftop deck!  My son picked us up so parking was not an issue.  The place was very clean and well equipped in all rooms especially the kitchen.  I would definitely recommend staying here instead of a hotel."
5078127,45975105,2015-09-07,12273051,Kathleen,"Dylan's Southie home was perfect for our Boston weekend!! Amazing place in a residential area, with a great kitchen for entertaining, a stroll to the waterfront,  and a beautiful roof top deck! Southie is a fun area full of great neighborhood restaurants, and the T is a short 2 block walk to get into the city or any other points of interest. Dylan was very accommodating and so easy to communicate with.  We will add this to our list of our favorite places in Boston!!"
5078127,48620668,2015-09-27,44382011,Alla,"I came to Boston with my parents and we all loved the place. It's spacious, gorgeous, and very close to everything. We took Uber everywhere, and it was very cheap. Dylan was great from the beginning. He responded very quickly, sent me all the information I needed, and was available by phone if needed throughout our stay. We didn't have to bother him, because his directions and instructions were great, and the place was exactly everything we needed."

The roof deck looked so gorgeous, unfortunately, it rained the whole weekend we were there and couldn't use it!  It's just a short walk to the Red line T stop, so you can easily get anywhere in Boston. I would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to stay in Boston."

He was incredibly organised, and sent through a very comprehensive pack by email, and then made every effort to make sure that we'd got it.  Getting the keys was simple and everything very well explained in the document pack waiting for us on arrival.  The condo was clean, well stocked, and really very pleasant.  The rooms are airy and beautifully decorated.  I would highly recommend this home and its host."
5078127,72343030,2016-05-02,21122136,Damien,"Christopher & Dylan have absolutely nailed this AirBnB experience. Their House is absolute amazing!!! Incredible rooms and bathroom facilities, all the trimmings and a sensational roof top to hang out and chill with awesome views and BBQ. The guys have a welcome pack and city Guide which we followed and it felt like we were heading to the BEST places in Boston. Lovely neighbourhood, a short uber ride to most places in Boston. I recommend this place massively. Thanks Chris & Dylan."
5078127,75270542,2016-05-20,20323199,Alan,"Chris & Dylan's beautifully decorated, serene and tech-drenched condo in South Boston (as distinguished from the South End) proved to be a perfect launch pad for our explorations of the city. Located a mere three blocks from the Andrews Square station on the Red Line, we found we could easily get everywhere we wanted to go with only an occasional transfer. Uber also works splendidly in this part of the city, and if you're ambitious enough - and want to tack on a few miles to your Fitbit steps - the walk to downtown Boston is very doable."
Their home is situated on a quiet dead-end street in an area of Boston that is clearly experiencing a renaissance but still retains  its working-class humility. There are no soaring buildings here competing for the best views; rather,all the new construction and rehabilitation reflects the origins of the area which are evident in street after street of modest,low-rise homes.,,,
We stayed for five nights and hosted our son and daughter-in-law in a second bedroom where they claim they got their best sleep in weeks. The condo itself has a terrific layout and boasts a large island in the kitchen,adjacent to the living room,for lingering after breakfast. We were delighted to experiment with the built-in WiFi sound system which effortlessly broadcast our stored music throughout the condo.,,,
The kitchen was well-stocked with spices and every conceivable appliance as well as an ample supply of dishes,flatware,utensils and pots and pans. The master bedroom suite includes a large shower stall and a heated mattress which came in handy on the first few cold nights of our stay.,,,
The upstairs roof deck provided a supreme view of the environs and a comfortable outdoor space for a delightful BBQ.,,,,,
The owners were extremely responsive,replying to texts within minutes.  One needs to be conscientious about the alarm and taking one's shoes off,reflecting the care the attention of the owner's investment. Perfect space for two couples,with ample shared space for meals and lounging. Thank you!,,
Bonus tip: While foraging for food in the neighborhood we stumbled upon a tiny but wonderful market,"American Provisions (URL HIDDEN) within reasonable walking distance of the condo.\"",,,,
5078127,75609930,2016-05-22,40066360,Samoria,Christopher and Dylan's listing was 100% accurate which was extremely comforting to find upon arrival.

Our only issue with the property was the lack of storage. The closets, drawers and counters were full of personal items.  The home was well organized but I was surprised to find the dishwasher filled with dirty dishes and no space in the refrigerator/freezer.  Christopher responded quickly to my text and explained that the condo is their full-time residence and not a \"\"rental property\"\".  He said I could take the beer out of the fridge to make more room for our stuff but we decided to avoid the hassle and do take-out for our meals.  All in all we were happy with the rental.\""

The room was basically brand new with a very comfy bed.  I would recommend a stay here to anyone and will certainly plan to return on my next trip to Boston."
13327034,80877600,2016-06-20,68137870,Jesse,"This was my first AirBnB experience. Let me put it this way: For about a quarter of the price of a hotel, you get about half-to-three-quarters of a hotel experience, in a just-OK location. Joe is a great host and it's clear he's working hard to make his place better, and the basic necessities and cleanliness requirements are all met, but I'd be more inclined to trying a new place next time than re-booking here. The things that can be improved, like not having a mirror in the room or hand towels in the bathrooms, are relatively minor but would greatly enhance the visit. More relevant is how clearly sound travels between all the rooms in the house. I went assuming there'd be several rooms in the house (there were), but I was guessing the vibe would be more like a 'dorm' and less like a 'hotel', but that wasn't the case--everyone pretty much keeps to themselves."
Joe was very friendly and very responsive. For an extra service fee,he'll even pick you up and drop you off at the airport--both my flights were at ungodly hours but he was there on time.  So my overall rating is 4 stars -- 5 for the host,but 3 for the room and location.,,,

This place is really clean, feels more like  a hotel, towels, shampoo, really nice shower!

This is a perfect spot to explore the south end with it's many restaurants, shops and historic beauty. It was always a pleasure to return at the end of our day out enjoy Boston. We especially enjoyed the roof deck. It is a very comfortable and relaxing space. I would 100% recommend this to my friends and family."
442735,40148196,2015-07-28,26154366,Noah,"Sarah was a great host. The apartment was comfortable and clean, the rooftop patio had a wonderful view of Boston, and the location was perfect. Everything was exactly as advertised. I'd absolutely stay here again."
442735,55520782,2015-12-01,46423384,Sarah,Sarah was very open with communication and was also very welcoming.  She left comprehensive notes for us about her apartment and also about the surrounding area which were helpful.
"The apartment itself is lovely and cosy and well equipped.  My kids loved being able to play with the toys and it was a really cosy place to stay.  The area is also lovely with restaurants and shops close by.  I would definitely recommend Sarah's place.\"",,,,,
442735,71074407,2016-04-23,43221066,Doug,"Our family of 5 (incl. a baby) stayed here for a week and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves! The apartment was clean, cozy, and had everything we needed for our stay and more. The location was great - quiet, safe, close to transportation and some really nice restaurants and cafes. Sarah was a fantastic host! Prompt with all communications and checked in with us a few times just to make sure we were enjoying our stay. The instructions and advice (for TV/wifi/garbage/etc.) she left were also very helpful. One touch we also appreciated tremendously was the bottle of prosecco they left for us, since they knew that one of our party was in town to run the Boston Marathon. Overall, easy to recommend and we would do it again in a heartbeat the next time we come to Boston."
442735,80961596,2016-06-20,8226107,Jenna,"Everything was fantastic. I would recommend this apartment to anyone but those with mobility issues (it is a walk-up, as very clearly stated in the listing). It was extremely comfortable for our group of 4, with everything we could need - including a french press and coffee maker, lovely outdoor space and comfortable places to sit and relax."
Sarah was great with all communication before,during and after.,,,,
The neighborhood was fantastic. Very close walking distance to some amazing restaurants and bars. We only walked,never needed to drive,during our entire visit.,,,
Everything was great,and I'd happily stay there again or recommend this listing to my friends.,,,,
Thanks,"Sarah!\"",,,,
442735,82696149,2016-06-28,61739254,Emil,Our stay in Boston with three boys was perfect in Sarah's sanctuary. The evenings at the rooftop with tasty cheese from across the street will be in our memory for many days ahead!
"Sarah was very responsive and flexible with our needs and we felt very safe! We will absolutely stay with them again when we come back to our favourite town Boston!\"",,,,,
442735,92831995,2016-08-10,15761655,Laura,"Absolutely adored this place!!  Much better than the photos show.   It was very comfortable and the decor was stylish yet very practical.   We stayed with 2 boys and they really enjoyed the accommodations.   The 2nd floor has a sleeping area which is not air conditioned but it's really nice and leads up to the roof.   The bunk beds in the 2nd bedroom were very comfy.    I felt right at home in the master bedroom, it was extremely comfortable, the room was filled with books and felt warm and inviting.  it leads to a patio filled with plants and charming decor.  The views of Boston (Back Bay) were stunning!!!"
The rooftop desk is out of this world!!  The views were amazing,such a wonderful to sit and relax.,,,,
The hosts are very thoughtful,the amenities were good and maps were provided.,,,,
I was especially grateful that the hosts were so responsive and helpful with everything.  Communication was really good.,,,,,
The neighborhood is charming,there is a really good cheese shop with fresh bread across the street and cafes and little shops in the area.,,,,

4518100,25625932,2015-01-20,22168556,C,The reservation was canceled 103 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4518100,29805233,2015-04-12,16133053,Katharina,The host was really friendly and anwsered me all my questions. The two bedroom apartment wasn't free for us but we got a really good apartment insteat. Our Trip was really spontaneous but the hosts was really friendly.
4518100,32098066,2015-05-13,16998409,Tracey,"This apartment was in a great location, very clean, and the host was friendly and accommodating. I would stay here again. The check in and check out was super easy."
4518100,35213002,2015-06-16,20118724,David,"Pretty basic operation throughout. Keys were aailable on schedule, but beyond that  no effort made by host. Apartment has few amenities. No sharp knives, few kitche(URL HIDDEN) utensils, no written instructions, basic tv, etc. No fire escape noted."
4518100,35650998,2015-06-21,1588470,Rana,"This apartment was perfect for our needs. We spent most of our waking hours at a conference held at the nearby Marriott Long Wharf (a pleasant 8-minute walk at a brisk pace), but would love to return to this 2-bedroom apartment for a vacation getaway."
The apartment was clean,comfortable,private,and exactly as pictured in the listing photos. Jan made sure we knew about the stairs to enter before booking. The apartment also had a large screen television,which we did not have time to use as we spent all our free time exploring the North End. Internet worked just fine.,
We didn't use the kitchen much as the local restaurants were amazing,but we appreciated being able to reheat leftovers and store snacks in the refrigerator. Water from the kitchen tap was notably delicious -- tasted like nothing,which was a real treat for me after living in NJ and the Midwest. Also no strange smells in the apartment,which is important to me! The sheets were impossibly soft and we both slept very well on the comfortable mattress. Apt is on a relatively quiet street -- we slept with windows open for a nice breeze and were not bothered by street noise.,,
Jan made us feel very welcome even before we arrived. She sent us detailed instructions regarding the check-in process and a file describing some things to do in the North End,as well as an offer to answer any questions we had. Upon our arrival we noticed a couple of minor issues which she swiftly resolved.,,,,
Our pre-tip costs for Uber from the airport cost $25,while a return taxi trip to the airport was ~$18. We used Uber to visit Cambridge for ~$8.50 then walked back after a big meal.,,,,
"Would definitely return to this apartment and hostess if we find ourself in the area again. Our experience here was better than it would have been in a big box hotel and also more in line with our budget than the area hotel prices. Thanks!\"",,,,,
4518100,35914333,2015-06-23,28389695,Amanda,Received an email with key details the day before. Instructions were accurate and easy to follow. Apartment was on 3rd floor up narrow stairs - which the owner told us when we booked so we were aware. great area I. The North End where it is has loads of great Italian restaurants nearby and comfortable vibe. Bedrooms were great. Lounge was a little dark - but as per the photo. That part could do with a little more cleaning. Problem with plumbing which meant we couldn't have shower straight after flight so pretty frustrating. Sent email and it did get sorted the next day v quickly. Ideal location just off freedom trail
4518100,37560134,2015-07-08,30027227,승은,"We really enjoyed our stay in Boston. This place is as pictured. Comfortable,clean,safe and great location. I hope we can stay here again."
4518100,39483566,2015-07-24,6614933,Valerie,The key and instructions were where we were told they were.
4518100,66175100,2016-03-20,27487492,Michael,Background: Stayed at apartment for approx 5 weeks while purchasing home in Mass.
Overall: Jan is a superstar! My wife and I were relocated to Boston and we had the option off using AirBnB for our temporary housing. Jan made sure that we were comfortable and happy. We were used to living in a 4000 sqft house and we found ourselves in a 650 sqft apartment. Jan made sure that we had everything we needed and even hooked us up with a local service man to take care of day to day needs. We loved our time living in Boston and a good part of that was Jan's kindness and respect for our family. I highly recommend using this service if you are looking for an affordable option in Boston.,,,,,
Pros - Easy transaction,pleasure to deal with,close to everything in Boston. Minutes walk from Blue/Green/Orange T stations (subway),close to public parks for kids,great food steps away as well as Starbucks,friendly neighbors in the building
Cons - Virtually no parking whatsoever and very aggressive parking ticketers. If you must park,expect a ticket for $40 for every day that you street park. The parking lots in the area are virtually no help at all with approx $40/day rates so you will pay,at and pay a lot if you are unlucky enough to be travelling with a vehicle. Extraordinarily hot water out of the faucets and shower. Not a big deal for me,but I have little kids and they had to be monitored closely as the water comes out screaming out if you aren't careful. Virtually zero cell service in the apartment.,,
In summary: Fantastic service,great location,affordable price,would use again.  If you need lodging in Boston on a budget,this is the best you could hope for!,

4518100,68867290,2016-04-07,828578,David,"We loved it. Perfect location, in a very beautiful neighborhood with lots of amazing restaurants nearby. Very comfortable beds. Very responsive management. The only negatives were that it was quite a dark apartment and that it is a lot of steps to get there without a lift (good fitness though!). Overall, it was a fantastic experience."
4518100,71296445,2016-04-24,5966644,Stephanie,"Pros: Clean, decent amount of space for a Boston apartment, and great location.  The beds in the two bedrooms were quite comfortable.  All basic amenities (except for trash bags), including towels, silverware, toilet paper, etc were included, so there was no fuss over buying that stuff."
"Cons: The only reason I didn't rate this as 5-stars is because someone from property management entered the apartment without any prior notice and took the folding bed. The only reason we even noticed is because we came back that night and saw that it was gone.  I e-mailed Jan trying to get it back but was not able to.  It's a pretty big privacy violation to enter an apartment  for a non-emergency reason without prior notice.\"",,,,,
4518100,73981749,2016-05-12,40509313,Michelle,"Stayed for one night with 3 friends, it was perfect. We were close to TD Garden, parking and all the great spots we love in the North End. I would absolutely recommend this place - the only negative would be I didn't notice an elevator, but if you can do stairs - it's perfect."
"Very clean and the beds were super comfy. \"",,,,,
4518100,74880669,2016-05-17,42636267,Kim And Ian,"Great location! Plenty of great restaurants nearby, and the freedom trail is just a few blocks away. Located close to Haymarket station, which makes it easy to get anywhere in the Boston. Well-stocked kitchen with pots, pans, plates and glasses. Only complaint is that we had a lot of interruptions when we were in the actual apartment. We had a tour of apartment occur and we were not notified about it ahead a time which left us scrambling to get out the door. There was another tour later during our stay and we were notified. We also had someone try to drop off their deposit at our place, another person from a neighboring apartment came to borrow a charger. Twice, we had people try to enter our apartment thinking it was theirs. One of the times they were able to unlock our deadbolt-fortunately we were inside at the time and told them they had the wrong place. Makes me nervous that they keys seem to be the same and that anyone could enter our place if they live in the building. I"
4518100,75913340,2016-05-23,16901535,Gracia,Good communications via e-mail. Did not meet the manager of the rental property but was given good instructions as to what to do.
5174821,27219290,2015-02-28,16223601,Hyewon,"Alex and his partner are so awesome and generous! The room and other facilities were the same as pictures. They kept contacting me asking my comfort and safety during my staying. What`s  more impressive was that he allowed me to check in so early in the morning considering my arrival time in Boston in super freezing winter. They provided fruits and light food for breakfast to us, so I could have them saving much money. I totally recommend this room with no hesitation!"
5174821,27777807,2015-03-11,22728114,Andrea,Alex and Wayne were great hosts! They were extremely helpful with everything I needed. Their apartment is beautiful and cozy! Would definitely stay here again!

The bedroom had plenty of space for me, easily to accommodate a couple. Only a 15min walk to MTBA and 10min walk to Bunker Hill and the Freedom Trail. I would definitely stay with them again next time I'm in Boston."

5174821,29644607,2015-04-10,30619128,Zhan,Alex and Wayne are very nice people and the place is just as nice and clean as advertised. Although checking out at 7am was a bit early for me but everything was good. Overall I would recommend the place to others for future stay.
5174821,29838836,2015-04-13,12356617,Michelle,"Alex was a terrific host. My boyfriend and I were arriving and departing at different times and he made us both feel very welcomed and comfortable the entire time. He was really flexible and accommodating, giving us lists of local favorite coffee shops, restaurants, etc. The Charlestown neighborhood is very quaint and has so much history. It was just a 10 minute walk to the T to get to downtown."
5174821,30223451,2015-04-19,29714618,Heather,Wayne and Alex were wonderful hosts. Alex was in contact in advance of our arrival to ensure we had everything we needed prior to arriving. They were very welcoming and personable and they provided unexpected and thoughtful extras. Wayne even went out of his way to show us the neighbourhood.
Their apartment was as depicted in the photos and description. It was comfortable and clean and we were invited to use it as if it was our home. We found everything we needed for an enjoyable stay.,,,,,
The neighbourhood was safe and within convenient walking distance to the T and local shops. The location was quiet and away from the noise of the main street and traffic.,,,,,

The apartment is very charming and the decor was lovely. The street is situated on a steep hill but it is worth the effort. Because the bedroom was slightly on the petite side, I would recommend it for a great short stay apartment in Boston. It is a 15 minute walk to the subway and Bunker Hill for the start of the Freedom Trail (highly recommended)."

We stepped into the apartment and were immediately pleased with the cozy and comfortable interior! Our room was also scented with a lighted candle that definitely helped us unwind after long travelling hours.

5174821,49972882,2015-10-08,24788354,Alice,"Thanks to Alex and Wayne for a lovely stay at your apartment. We really felt at home. It was really clean, lovely rooms and a great base. Everything went so smoothly and the guys were great company."
5174821,50433330,2015-10-12,3767488,Steffany,"What a great place to stay close to the Freedom Trail. We arrived from a red eye flight and was greeted with a tray of warm baked goods!  Just what we needed to take the edge off before we found the cafe down the street. The location was easy to access via car and very easy to walk to Bunker Hill and other sights along the trail. We found the restaurants nearby to be very good and convenient although there weren't many of them to choose from.   Close to Whole Foods, liquor store, coffee shop and Dunkin Donuts. We did take the subway once and it was a nice walk back to the apartment. Apartment was just what we expected and Alex was very friendly and helpful with all of our questions."
5174821,52787594,2015-11-01,30058571,Elisa,"Alex was very welcoming and his home was very comfortable.  The location was great, and we'd definitely be open to staying here again if we needed to be in the area."
5174821,55842145,2015-12-06,21878787,Garance,"We had a great stay at Alex's place ! Its perfect to relax after à day of visit, close to the subway in a very nice neighborhood :)"
"We didn't had the chance to meet Them but their indications to find the appartement were very clear. Definitly a great place to stay in Boston ! \"",,,,,
5174821,76937222,2016-05-29,73091279,Thuyen,"Alex's place is very nice apartment. Small and cute place to stay. It is in a quiet neighborhood and pretty closed to Boston downtown. Can communicate to downtown by bus #93 or #92 or by Uber for about $10. The price was the most affordable comparing to other places in downtown /China town, but it is what you need after a hot and busy day exploring Boston. About the apartment, overall is clean and neat, well instructions on sticky notes from Alex help guiding us while they are not there. Everything we need is ready in room or instructed in the guide, so we feel very comfortable. Just one last thing, the bed making noise every time I touch it, hopefully they don't find too noisy"
5174821,77325118,2016-05-31,15426700,Brianne,"Alex was a wonderful host, and incredibly accommodating during our stay. Unfortunately we didn't meet, but his directions were thorough and made finding the apartment easy. The apartment perfectly fit the description, was clean, and a very comfortable place to stay. It was exactly what we needed for one night in Boston. Transport was easy, though we took Uber most everywhere as it wasn't very expensive from Charlestown into the main parts of the city. Alex was even kind enough to let us store bags, which made our stay even more comfortable and convenient. Alex was incredibly fast at communicating, and was helpful with any questions we had."
5174821,79158592,2016-06-11,8325062,Laurie,Both Alex and Wayne were very kind and made me feel welcome. I really loved their dog! The room was as described. Charlestown is a very nice neighbourhood. I will not hesitate to go back if ever I'm in Boston again.

10175033,69029608,2016-04-08,30777982,Andy,"Great roof deck, nice comfortable apt.  Quiet street that is one downhill away from the hopping North End.  Susan was responsive and helped me find whatever I needed!"
10175033,71419425,2016-04-25,40525537,Teresita,"The Airbnb was amazing - well furnished, clean, and lots of amenities. The bathroom light did go out during our stay, though, but that's a minor issue. We appreciated the welcome package on the kitchen counter, and the Wi-fi was fast and reliable. Would definitely stay here again - thanks for a great experience!"

10175033,72611361,2016-05-03,4232930,Moira,"I highly recommend North End Apartment, the location was very convenient to two stations (North station & Haymarket), a ten minute walk to the Boston Public Market and short stroll to all of North End's great Italian restaurants. The apartment is also located on the freedom trail so you never need get lost!"
The apartment was great,nice and cosy with an outdoor deck with the most wonderful view of the Charles river. The host,Susan,was lovely to deal with and very responsive to queries.,,
"Do yourself a favour and stay here.\"",,,,,
10175033,73811574,2016-05-10,55569662,Leslie,This is a great apartment in Boston's North End with views and a roof terrace. There is plenty of space and character and really close walk to everything in Boston. Nicely decorated.
10175033,74387088,2016-05-15,65916370,Stephanie,"Susan was very quick to respond to emails and answered my phone call right away.  The apartment was just as described.  The rooftop deck was a great place to relax and enjoy the view.  This apartment is in a great location, close to Hanover Street and just a few blocks from the North Station."

"I would highly recommend you book here !\"",,,,,
10175033,78615638,2016-06-07,12733369,Carol,"Wow, What a wonderful apartment! Everything was top notch.  The rooms nicely decorated, beds comfy after a long day at our conference and the view from the deck is to die for. The kitchen is well appointed. The  neighborhood is safe and fun to roam around. We did lots of local shopping for great Italian foods and then cooked in, enjoying dining while watching the sunset from the deck. Susan was very responsive to our questions and the neighbors we met were quite friendly. We really hope to come back in the future! Thanks, Susan for such a fine experience."
10175033,80676134,2016-06-19,35148625,Alexandra,Great neighborhood-wonderful host-very attentive-GREAT VIEW! So nicely decorated and put together-really a great stay
10175033,82459994,2016-06-27,38200928,Andrea,Easy access to the Metro lines from Susan's apartment. Great and clean apartment as advertised. I enjoyed the roof top deck over looking the Charles River. Very close to great restaurants and historic sights around Boston. I would recommend this place...just be ready to climb some stairs. It's on the 3rd floor!
10175033,86916057,2016-07-18,14692227,Fabian,"I cannot imagine a better apartment in Boston. It has such a European charm going - the two-story layout, the incredibly tasteful interior, the beautiful terrace with an amazing view of the sun setting over the harbour... everything was in perfect shape when I arrived, a/c, shower, oven etc all working great."
Susan made the check-in and check-out super easy. I was on my own in Boston for a conference,and so only occupied one of the bedrooms (the yellow one with the waterfront view). One has to be mindful that it is a historic building,just off the Freedom Trail,and so there is no elevator and a narrow staircase -- not a problem for me but probably not good for an older person with heavy luggage.,,
The location in the North End is very central,and there are dozens of Italian restaurants,cafes,"bakeries etc. all within ten minute walking distance. I will come back for sure next time I'm in Boston.\"",,
10175033,88026630,2016-07-22,59254910,Lauren,Susan's apt is fantastic. It was spotless and had everything we needed in terms of towels and kitchen accessories. Susan was very responsive to our few questions. Beautiful roof deck and great neighbirhood. Would love to stay here again.
10175033,89571937,2016-07-29,11542288,Kristen,Great location! Very clean. Just as pictured!  Susan was easy to reach and very pleasant.
10175033,94278152,2016-08-15,77829761,Brian,"Had an amazing trip to Boston and it was wonderful staying in such a wonderful location. The place was clean, the location was perfect, and the host was very helpful in accommodating us. If I went back to Boston, I would most definitely stay here again."
10175033,95995944,2016-08-21,13342411,Ed,"Susan is a wonderful hostess and made extra special accommodation for me! Thank you, I would love to return in September. Ed"
10175033,97025016,2016-08-25,88202279,Adam,Susan's place is a beautifully decorated and comfortable dwelling over looking the harbor. It's located in a festive and historic part of town so chances are good that there is fun to be had nearby. The restaurants were good and the history rich! Overall it fit our needs nicely. We'd certainly consider staying here again.
10175033,99445519,2016-09-04,26537309,Andrew,"Had an outstanding stay with my family!  Apartment is bright and clean; very well appointed.  Found the location to be excellent, just off the freedom trail and next to Copp's Hill Burying Ground.  We were able to walk to all the local hotspots in about 10-15 minutes."
The view from the deck is fantastic.  Great place for eating,boat watching,relaxing.,,,
This outstanding property does come with a cost - 3 very steep,"narrow flights of stairs to the main level.  If you have difficulty climbing more than one flight of stairs should consider this.\"",,,,
3677662,16865381,2014-08-03,17691090,Ted,steffen was a very attentive host and both check-in and check-out were seamless.  The unit was clean and worked well for the three people we placed there for a week.  Steffen made sure that we felt welcome and even showed my team around the neighborhood on the night we arrived.
Neighborhood is difficult for on-street parking but very convenient to public transportation,especially transiting to and through Harvard Square.,,,,
"Definitely recommend.\"",,,,,
3677662,18085919,2014-08-21,2799532,Matt,"Steffen is fantastic. I arrived the first night very late, after midnight, and he was completely accommodating. He responded quickly to any questions I had. The apartment is close to the Harvard Ave T stop on the green line making it easy to get around Boston. The apartment was clean and plenty of linens were available. I would stay here again."
3677662,19135475,2014-09-07,18916264,Liam,"Steffan and his wife Hannah were helpful and welcoming. Great location in a quiet street  close to shops, eating places, the T and, most importantly, our son's flat in Harvard Ave. The apartment was comfortable and clean, there's a great coffee maker, and the fresh fruit and other food in the fridge  were much appreciated. Our only niggle was the need for better sheets and towels ."
3677662,19476487,2014-09-13,17573679,Feng,"The apartment is perfect for a family. You can find everything nearby. Thank you so much, Steffen!!"
3677662,20304935,2014-09-27,21202381,Max,"Steffen was very welcoming, and kindly had left some food in the kitchen in case I was hungry. The apartment is really well positioned for both exploring Allston and for travelling the short journey into the centre of the city. The apartment was really nicely furnished with lots of interesting art, and the bed was comfortable."
3677662,20970728,2014-10-08,20331154,Josh,Great location and hosts.
3677662,21348760,2014-10-15,21300563,Gabriela,"Such a great stay! We came to Boston for a long weekend trip and we could not have picked a better place to stay... the neighborhood is lovely and there's an integral bus stop and a T stop just a block away in opposite directions. The apartment itself is incredibly cozy, the room a perfect size for an individual or couple... and the bathroom is right next to it, so you almost feel like you're in your own little world. Steffen thoughtfully stocked an entire fridge-shelf with food items for our use. There were plenty of bedclothes and towels available to us. Although we spent the greater part of the day out and about, it was so nice to know this beautifully furnished apartment was where our days would end and begin. Home-y, welcoming highlight: slippers!"
3677662,21667444,2014-10-21,21465516,Mary,"This was a cool, older apartment in a fantastic, eclectic neighborhood. We especially loved the wainscoting and the hardwood floors. The food in the fridge made it easy to grab a quick, healthful breakfast and go. The neighborhood was loud late on weekend nights due to the student population in the area.  Still, it was no louder than a hotel can be and much more rewarding. Steffen was out of town, but his roommate Moe made us feel especially welcome. We visited with him quite a while. We couldn't quite figure out the espesso machine. Instructions on how to use it, or an auto drip coffee maker would have worked better for us. Another drawback was the lack of counter space in the bathroom, but that's the price you pay for charm!  Overall, given the price, and the proximity to fantastic grocery stores, restaurants and transportation, we were very satisfied."
3677662,22672953,2014-11-11,22048696,Shengyang,"It's a nice flat, convenient location with many decent restaurants at its neighbor. Bus and train are super convenient to take you to the downtown, Harvard MIT etc."
3677662,23651957,2014-12-07,23931210,Marius,"Nice apartment, very conveniently located, 5min walk from tram station. Steffen is a wonderful host and responds very quickly to all questions. You'll have most of the apartment for yourself most of the time."
3677662,27353097,2015-03-02,4995989,Tim,Steffen was one of the best hosts I think we've ever had. He was super responsive and made sure we were comfortable during our stay. We especially appreciated the stocked fridge full of delicious breakfast items.
The space itself was in the perfect location - close to shops,restaurants,and ample public transportation options. The kitchen was well appointed with everything we needed to cook our own meals.,,,
"We would stay here again. Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
3677662,28145013,2015-03-18,9338135,Marigold,"The place is really well located, in a cool neighbourhood with lots of places to eat and drink. It is really convenient to public transport."
The apartment is fantastic. Better than the pictures. The place is very clean,warm (we visited in winter),and really nicely set-up and decorated. We were really pleased with ourselves for finding this place and we felt super comfortable cooking,etc. Steffen even stocked the fridge with essentials! This was a really thoughtful gesture and just demonstrates Steffen's attention and consideration of his guests.,,
If we were given a single sentence,we wold say that Steffen is the perfect Airbnb host. He went out of his way to help us when we arrived,took time to show us around the unit,gave us some tips for getting around and made us feel really welcome. We were really blown away by his hospitality and kindness.,,
"Mo (Steffen's housemate) is also really nice and helpful.\"",,,,,
3677662,28812264,2015-03-30,14290556,Dalia & Aldo,"Steffen and his roommate Moe were the consummate hosts.  Steffen communicated with me prior to my arrival and connected me with Moe, who would be in to greet me.  I got in late, and was tired and hungry.  Moe hadn't eaten dinner yet either, so we ended up going out to eat together at a great hot pot place he recommended."
Back at the apartment,which by the way is very cool,incredibly well-decorated,and very comfortable,Steffen had stocked an entire shelf of the fridge with food for me--milk,kefir
What I really appreciated was the personal touch that Steffen and Moe brought to hosting.  I was in town to look for an apartment of my own in Boston,and they both were actively interested and engaged with my search.  Moe even offered to lend me his car!  I didn't trust myself with it so declined.  :)  Steffen texted with me throughout the weekend and gave me advice about different neighborhoods.  I felt like we were good friends by the time of my departure.,,,,
When it came to my departure,I wasn't ready to check out until quite late,because I had packed so many apartment appointments into the day.  Steffen made arrangements for me to leave the key with a trusted third party since he and Moe couldn't be available to meet me at that hour.  His flexibility and kindness was very much appreciated.,,,
The apartment is in a very convenient neighborhood,with quick access to the 57 and 66 buses and the B line T.  There are many affordable and good restaurants in the area,and I particularly enjoyed the coffee at Pavement.  For those of you who appreciate quiet,"do note that this neighborhood is populated by many students who like to carouse on the weekend!\"",,
3677662,29680883,2015-04-11,29071024,Zhehui,"Steffen is a great landlord! He is super nice and helpful! The house is exactly what my parents want to live in Boston, walking distance to harvard st, easy access to T and a lot of nice things to see nearby."

3677662,31249916,2015-05-03,19190427,Sean,Steffen is an excellent host.  He was very accomodating and pleasant and made me feel at home.  Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to talk with Steffen more or explore Allston but it is a lovely apartment in a great neighborhood.
3677662,32979037,2015-05-24,13157372,Kunchy,"Steffen was really nice and accommodating with my arrival time. Despite not living in the area, he came to property just to see that my mom and I has settled well in the apartment. The apartment is extremely clean with large living space. The location is very convenient with a lot of nice restaurant nearby in additional to T-stop (harvard ave) and bus stop just by the corner. I would definitely recommend people who want to visit Boston to book this property in advance before it gets fully booked!"
3677662,33592562,2015-05-30,23828355,Brent,Steffen was a fantastic host. Personally showed the local area with a walking tour. He was very thorough with transportation and restaurant locations- highly recommend!

He welcomed us to our room, giving information about the ac, bathroom, kitchen facilities and available breakfast food and drink. The space was comfortable and the ac cooled the bedroom for an enjoyable sleep.  Breakfast in the dining room off the main room shown in the photo was quiet and cool."

He was there to let me in, get me a cold beverage, and show me around the apartment, and then even took me on a walk all around the neighborhood. He knows the area well and clearly loves it."
The space itself was great. Clean and very comfortable,with lovely touches,pictures,and art,and the all important a/c. I felt at ease using the shared spaces,and the room is in the back
3677662,50087768,2015-10-09,18807299,Dault,"Stephen gets an A+ for saving us from a complete down pour when we arrived, delivering an umbrella for my wife and help with the luggage for the short walk from the train stop. The apt. is very well located in Allston to resturants and stores and was very convienent for travel to downtown Boston as we used the train"
"( The \"\"T\"\" ) every day for site seeing! The room was perfect for our needs as we just needed a place to sleep and shower even though he has a full kitchen for your use. Moe",his roomy gave us plenty of privacy,,,,

3677662,51538424,2015-10-21,28291843,Elsbet,Steffen greeted us when we arrived and allowed us to drop our bag off  early in the morning which was much appreciated.  He was very flexible with check in/outs which worked out great with our flights.  There is lots of good food around and its close to the green line which made getting around Boston convenient.  He also leaves some food essentials in the fridge mostly for breakfast and snacks which was very generous.

The apartment itself is very pleasant and in a great location for restaurants, and Steffen was a great host.

It felt like we were staying with a good friend!  10/10 would stay there again."

We loved all the collections at Steffen's place. The surrounding area was very safe and had many good restaurants.

The apartment is very comfortable and Moe, Steffan's roommate was very accommodating and really nice to hangout with, Steffan was an incredible host that would do anything to make you feel welcome.

3677662,65811557,2016-03-17,9231868,Diane,"Steffen was a wonderful host, fun to chat with and accommodating with my check-in/-out schedule.  I stayed at the apt. for a month with his roommate, Moe, who was friendly, helpful, and generous.  Although Steffen didn’t live on site, he took his hosting duties seriously and stopped by to reconnect with us about once a week.  Upon check-in, he welcomed me with a coffee and a shelf-full of breakfast supplies, and he also invited me on his drive to the nearest Trader Joe’s and Brazilian market, pointing out a variety of recommended eateries along the way.  The apartment was lovingly decorated with artwork from Steffen’s international travels, and it was comfortably heated for the winter.  The room itself had a comfortable real bed, and was well-insulated from Allston’s festive weekends.  Plenty of storage and shelf space was provided in the kitchen/fridge, bedroom, and bathroom for the AirBnb guest, and the washer and dryer in the basement were easy to use.  Steffen and Moe made sure I felt at home here, and I look forward to my next stay.  Thank you both!"

3677662,75099629,2016-05-18,19944424,Manisha,Excellent and very warm welcome from host.  Steffen organised all the necessary basics for breakfast and that was very kind of him.  The apt is on the 2nd floor.  As such it is not too tough to get the luggage up.  It is also convenient to go to town with the green line a few minutes walk away and several bus line connection.  If you have to get in town an express bus also runs at peak hours.  In addition with the range of shops and restaurants you are well served.  Only problem I faced was that the proximity of some bars leads to noisiness and inconveniences if there are flights or issues that involve the police and sirens.  Afterwards I slept with the windows and that enabled being cut off from the noise outside.
3677662,77416317,2016-05-31,50847168,Hannah,Although we never met Steffen he was an awesome host! He helped us so much with our plans and answered every question I had immediately.
His wife met us at the apartment,showed us everything and made us feel welcome. There were so many unexpected little treats like a food and milk for breakfast in the fridge. His roomate was also a lot of fun.,,,,
"The apartment is wonderful and has so much style! We immediately felt at home. Everything is as Steffen described it or maybe even better. We really had a wonderful time and I can recommend this airBnB!\"",,,,,

Their apartment was very clean and the room looked just as it did in the picture. Their cat and dog were very friendly and we were impressed their kitty was toilet-training!,,,,,
Overall,"a very pleasant experience. \"",,,,

The place is quiet and everything is clean: you definitely feel at home. The public transportation is just 1 min away from the house and connects directly with the super-central South Station.,,,,,

Bei der Besichtigung von Boston unterstützen sie uns genauso wie bei unserer weiteren Reiseplanung. Die Unterkunft entsprach in vollem Umfang der Beschreibung. Es waren schöne Tage in Boston."

3057116,19970401,2014-09-21,7647832,Michael,Everything was exactly as described.  Peter and Stella were great and made us feel welcome immediately.  We had our 5 month old puppy with us and he was greeted by Buck (the dog) who was happy to share his place.  Thank you so much for everything.
3057116,20250244,2014-09-26,21016653,Marie,"\"I'd like to thank you Peter and Stella for your welcoming home \"\" ;-)"
3057116,20342014,2014-09-28,19382634,Paul,"Verhuurders waren niet thuis maar ze hadden goede instructies gegeven zodat we zelf het huis in konden. Peter, Stella, de kat en de hond zijn zeer vriendelijk. Kamer was prima, schoon met eigen badkamer en ook parkeerplaats achter het huis. Enig minpuntje is dat openbaar vervoer naar centrum vooral in weekend een beetje omslachtig is. Je moet kwartier lopen tot metrostation. Er schijnt ook een bus te gaan. Door de week kan je ook trein dichterbij pakken."
3057116,20514304,2014-09-30,19600469,Yujia,"他们家的人都很友好,家离公交车站很近,转车也很方便。邻居很友好。家里有一只猫和一只狗,小动物也很友好,特别喜欢他们家的狗。但是唯一不好的是家里地板上有狗毛,我衣服上也沾上毛了。"
3057116,21086967,2014-10-11,16190336,Jennifer,Peter's listing was fabulous. The room was beautiful and we were able to park our car in a secure place. The train was extremely close by and we enjoyed our stay. The pets were also cute.
3057116,21143285,2014-10-12,12307061,Nicole,Peter and Stella were awesome hosts. I flew into town to run the Boston Half Marathon and needed a place to stay for one night that was near the race. Their condo is 10 minutes from a beautiful park and the Franklin Zoo and it was absolutely perfect to get to where I needed to be at 7am for race day. We cooked together the night before and exchanged great conversation and really made me feel at home.
I highly recommend them as hosts and they are right next to a commuter train station if you need to get into Boston or anywhere else in New England. I couldn't have found a more perfect place to stay the night before my race. Thanks for being so accommodating and allowing me to come back after the race with my friends too.,,,,,
The condo and room are very clean and you will feel right at home. They certainly go out of their way to make you feel comfortable,not to mention the room you stay in is as it looks on the photo as well as the rest of their condo.,,,,
Thanks again for being such great hosts!!,,,,,

The house is lovely and clean, and the bedroom is cosy with a warm comfy bed! Their cat and dog are just lovely and love a good cuddle. Location was a little far out of the downtown, but it's hard to find anywhere as cheap any further in! Overall we had an excellent stay; would recommend this place to anyone coming out to Boston!"

Peter was quick to respond to my questions, giving excellent directions for getting downtown, parks to take a run, and activities I should do while in Boston.  Peter and Stella's home is warm and inviting (as pictured/described) and I enjoyed their friendly, loving pets.  I was very happy with the ease of access to downtown (the commuter rail/T is literally across the street) . They made my trip to Boston an easy one!  Thanks."

They organized for us to get in despite delays that has us arriving in the middle of the night, and had a lovely setup in a cosy room.

We spent quiet time in the beautiful balcony above our room. Peter and Stella are the nicest people, I wish we got more time to interact! I hope we get to meet again."
3057116,33686662,2015-05-31,1511844,Brenda,"My fiance and I had a great first airbnb experience thanks to Peter, Stella and their lovely pets.  It was great that Peter and Stella allowed us to check in early as we were in Boston for a graduation.  Peter and Stella were very accessible and responded quickly to my messages.  They even recommended a few restaurants and provided directions on how to get to their place from Logan airport.  The room and bath are very private and we pretty much had the 2nd floor to ourselves. The bathroom was also fully stocked with toiletries and nice fresh towels.  It's too bad we didn't get to meet Peter and Stella but it was a great experience! Thank you for everything."
3057116,35481825,2015-06-19,33611602,Barbara,"Peter and Stella were excellent in communicating with us, greeting us and making us feel right at home.  Stella met us at the door, and showed us right to our room  and bathroom, and filled us in about the easiest way to get around, and where to shop. Since we arrived on a Saturday afternoon, we walked to the subway stop, which was further than the commuter rail stop right around the corner, but chose to use the commuter rail stop for traveling back and forth to downtown Boston for the rest of the trip.  We texted back and forth when we needed help. They have two friendly pets.  The condo was immaculate, and the hardwood floors shone like glass. The neighborhood children and sounds were a bit louder than what we were used to at night, but the overall experience was was so good, we wouldn't hesitate to book it if/when we return to Boston and would recommend Peter and Stella's, particularly if you use the closer rail station. Thanks for a wonderful time."

The space was even better than described - the room had lots of space and the bed was very comfy and it was great having our own bathroom.  We really enjoyed getting to meet them and sharing a coffee - they genuinely seem interested in making people feel welcome.  The place is just a few steps from the train so it was a great location for exploring the city. Thanks for a fantastic stay!"
3057116,46479093,2015-09-11,5151085,Thomas,Peter had everything spelled out in his email preceding our stay.  He was responsive to the phone call I made to clarify some last minute issues.
3057116,47366951,2015-09-18,35103341,Lynne,"Peter and Stella were very welcoming hosts and we really enjoyed the opportunity to chat with them when our schedules crossed. The airbnb space was lovely with bedroom, bathroom, and additional study space if required, on a separate floor of its own...and everything is exactly as pictured. We also greatly appreciated being able to do some laundry very conveniently and to use the kitchen and dining space for our meals. As tourists without vehicle, we found the transport a bit awkward – it’s great if you can co-ordinate with the hourly commuter rail trains that are so handy, but this can be difficult when returning in the evening from different parts of the city. The T (metro) stop is about 20mins (brisk) walk which can be tiresome if returning late after a long day around the city sights and while there are connecting buses, these have their own quirks. Supermarket is about 7mins walk away (but in opposite direction to T station).  Such a lovely place to stay (Thanks Peter and Stella!) but we recommend getting familiar with the range of transport options early on - we just about got on top of it by the time we left!"

Their lovely pets gave us a warm welcome! The description of the property was accurate and perfect for us. It was very comfortable and homely. We loved relaxing on the balcony in the sunshine. Once we worked out the train timetables it was so easy to travel round Boston. This was our first experience of airbnb and we thoroughly enjoyed it.
3057116,49532013,2015-10-04,10984579,Paul & Vanessa,Peter & Stella were great hosts and made us feel very welcome in their home.

The room is spacious and as we are a group of three, we get two rooms in the end, one with a single bed and the other with a huge double bed. It is so sweet of them to give us each a candy to kickstart the stay. We got towels and shampoo and body wash, and more importantly, maps and train schedules. The place is a bit far from the city center but is indeed a nice and quiet neighbourhood. There is also a market nearby. It only takes half an hour or less to get into the main station in the city and Uberpool/ Lyftline reaches the house easily. Definitely recommend staying at Peter's place!"

Having them enquire about my day on the daily and checking in to see if i needed anything definitely contributed to this fabulous experience.

We enjoyed their hospitality as well as their adorable pets ;) They seemed to truly care about our wellbeing and made us feel as comfortable as possible.
The bedroom itself was clean and cosy and so was the rest of their home. We had a rental car during the visit and it was no problem to park it behind the house in the driveway. Tram and commuter rail are close by as described,so the place was a good starting point for exploring the city of Boston!,,,,

As long as you can time the schedules right, you will be in great shape! The room was really spacious and clean, and we really appreciated having our own bathroom.

Stella was there when I arrived and gave me the layout of the land...that room is bigger than it looks in the picture. I met Pete the following morning when I joined them for breakfast (Peter makes a great cup of jo!), and we had a great conversation. Other than that, I came and go when I wanted, and snuck off in the early hours of Monday to catch my flight. Though the location is a bit further out, Pete and Stella were marvelous hosts, and I would love to stay with them again if I return to the area—it was a wonderful stay."

The bed linens were nice, but the mattress wasn't so great.  I somehow missed that the bathrooms are shared, but it wasn't a big deal.  The bathroom on the 2nd floor was very nice and never occupied when I needed it.  Our room was clean and super quiet!  We didn't hear anything from anyone while inside.  The street is tucked away and very nice.  There is a lot within walking distance, and you can get to the T within 5 mins."

Boston is a beautiful city to visit with lots of things to do. I would recommend at least 4 days to see the most of it.,,,,,

3377871,17312787,2014-08-10,17552189,Jenny,"The room was cozy, and it had a sink, microwave and fridge which was convenient. The bathroom was shared but never had issues getting in to use it.  The bed springs were pretty obnoxious but weren't really uncomfortable and I wish I had an extra pillow. The room was on the third floor. There was laundry if we needed it and air conditioning in the room. The street was adorable and the location was EXCEPTIONAL.  So close to everything. I would stay there again if i didn't find another homier place instead.  Quiet, historic street."
3377871,17657354,2014-08-15,19660558,Chloe,The location is super and nearly everything is in walking distance. It's a great place for someone who travels alone.
3377871,18337217,2014-08-25,16316894,Claire-Aurélie,Very nice place in the heart of Boston. Beacon Hill is a charming borough !
The room is confortable with anything you need.,,,,,

3377871,18555812,2014-08-28,18993984,Suzanne,"De locatie van het appartement in Beacon Hill was helemaal top! Jammer was dat we ruim een half uur bij aankomst op de sleutel moesten wachten. Minpuntje verder was het bed, kort en het matras echt versleten!"
3377871,19140111,2014-09-07,8093291,Robyn,"Tiffany was great, communicative and helpful.  The room was clean and had everything we needed.  Enjoyed our weekend get-away and looking forward to our next trip to Boston!"
3377871,19552129,2014-09-14,20232719,Rosanna,"Tiffany was really responsive throughout the whole process and she was really welcoming when we first got there. This is a great location if you're planning on staying in the city of Boston because it's so convenient and you can basically walk to all the main attractions. This place is pretty much like a dorm room with a bed, tv and sink, but no bathroom. You'll have to share the bathroom with the people on the same floor. If you are not comfortable with that, then you might want to look somewhere else. Other than that, i think it's a decent place - can't find another place in Boston with the rate they're charging right in the middle of Boston."
3377871,19777293,2014-09-18,19305115,Signe,"Vi havde et rigtigt godt ophold i denne lejlighed. Beacon Hill er et super kvarter - meget centralt og virkelig hyggeligt. Man kan næsten ikke bo et bedre sted i Boston. Det er et stille område, tæt på alt. Værelset var rigtig fint og der var alt hvad man har brug for. Selvom der var delt toilet og badeværelse (rigtig godt badeværelse) mærkede vi intet til de andre lejere. Udlejer har været meget serviceminded og selv om vi ankom sent, var det intet problem at få nøglen. Det eneste der ikke var optimalt var, at sengen ikke var specielt god (temmelig blød) og at det kun var muligt, at lufte ud på værelset via en aircon, så der kunne godt blive lidt indelukket. Men alt i alt et rigtig godt sted at bo i Boston som jeg bestemt kan anbefale."
3377871,20231506,2014-09-26,2644251,Cindy And Steve,"I stayed in room 4 at 29 Hancock St. on Beacon Hill. Room was small but clean. The location is fantastic and easy to get to from the T subway station.  Good local bars and restaurants and a Whole Foods and CVS are quite near.  The manager of this property, Tiffany, was very pleasant, helpful and responsive. Boston is a great city and if I return, I'll definitely choose one of Tiffany's properties again."
3377871,20557872,2014-10-01,12819868,Franziska,"The apartment is really well located. The subway was near as well as the centre of Bosten downtown. Unfortunately the mattress was really uncomfortable. The wifi was bad, sometimes we were offline. We had to wait half an hour until someone opened the door of the house. The prize is quite high for a room without private bathroom."
3377871,20743999,2014-10-05,8662597,Kenneth,very organized apartment they have with many rooms.
appreciated the 24 hr service since we checked in late.,,,,,
not as nice in the rooms as we would have liked for the price point,the mattress is too bouncy,but thats okay.,,,
the washrooms are shared with other guests.,,,,,
free wifi and microwave were very helpful.,,,,,
the best part is really the location,right in walking distance of everything.,,,,

3377871,20962232,2014-10-08,15635817,Ramiro,"Great overall experience, location is the best! If you have a lot of luggage try to get one of the lower floor rooms, apart from that its great for the value! Tiffany was very kind and available for us."
3377871,21127867,2014-10-12,3021273,Nora,"Pasamos una estadía muy agradable en Beacon Hill (3 noches), un barrio histórico, cerca de todo lo que queríamos ver en nuestra primera visita a Boston."
El edificio es antiguo pero muy bien mantenido,en una cuadra en pendiente,que no significó un problema para nosotros. A pesar de estar a poco metros de una avenida importante -Cambridge- la zona es silenciosa.,,,
Tiffany nos espero con mucha cordialidad y nos dio precisiones para ubicarnos rápidamente y conocer la zona (gracias especialmente por la recomendación de Whole Foods market,donde la comida es rica y saludable!),,,,
El resto de los huéspedes fue muy silencioso,respetuoso y cuidadoso de las reglas de convivencia,por lo que el baño compartido no fue un problema en absoluto (solo una vez lo encontré ocupado).,,,
El baño está equipado con papel,jabón,secamanos y asientos para inodoro de papel. La ducha fuerte y caliente fue un alivio al final del día.,,,
La habitación (2da planta,pero solo un piso por escalera) tenía todo lo necesario,tal cual se ve en las fotos.,,,
La ropa de cama y las toallas,muy cómodas. La temperatura interior,muy agradable.,,,
El único aspecto que sugeriría actualizar es el colchón de resortes,que podría ser mejor.,,,,
Gracias por todo,Tiffany! Esperamos volver a Boston y a Beacon Hill en alguna otra oportunidad.,,,,

3377871,21512040,2014-10-19,19667831,Heiko,Tiffany was very friendly and helpful. We could even stay longer in the room due to a late flight. The location is perfect and close to all important sites. For two people it could be that the bed is a bit too small. Sharing bathroom was never a problem. There are two and one has a shower.
"Thanks to Tiffany.\"",,,,,
3377871,21702469,2014-10-22,13391680,Dominic,The neighbourhood is in a high end area of Boston and great location in easy walk to all the local sites.

3377871,23836847,2014-12-12,22306268,Veronica,"Tiffany is a very kind and nice host, the room is clean and quite comfortable"
3377871,28136068,2015-03-18,14361413,James,Tiffany was a great hostess! She made us feel welcome and she went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable! Tiffany's location is central to everything both by walking or short transit ride. I highly recommend staying at tiffany's lodging. Our room was immaculate and reflected her AirBnB description. Thank you Tiffany for everything!
3377871,28836112,2015-03-30,338650,Hayley,"Tiffany was very responsive via phone, text, and email. I never actually met her, but she made sure that I felt welcome."
3377871,32353148,2015-05-17,20577702,Elise,"I stayed 3 days and everything was great. Tiffany checked in every day to make sure that I had everything I needed. She was always very responsive and helpful. The room is of reasonable size for up to two people, the bathroom is shared with other people on the floor. Despite this, it was always very clean. The building is a very nice building ideally located in Beacon Hill, near the State House, only a short walk from the Freedom Trail, and about 10 minutes on foot from Cambridge. It's also around 5 minutes by walk from the subway station. So from there it is easy to go anywhere in Boston/Cambridge. It is a great alternative to the very pricey hotels around."
3377871,34780305,2015-06-12,21337872,Geneviève,"The location of this place really can't be beat: easy access to Beacon Hill, the North End, Boston Commons etc. etc. etc."
The room is little more than a private hostel room. Quite sparse. The bed in ours was very uncomfortable. In retrospect,the price seems quite high for what we got,but in general accommodation in Boston is quite expensive.,,,
"Tiffany was a bit hard to get ahold of when we were setting up key pick-up a few days before arrival. But we did get in touch and there were no issues after that. \"",,,,,
3377871,35414004,2015-06-18,996616,Emerson,Great location in a pretty quiet area. We had one small issue that Tiffany resolved very quickly. Great value and very very walkable. Shared bathrooms were not a problem for us.
3377871,36140314,2015-06-25,25201013,Dejan,Tiffany was very kind and accommodated my wife's and my needs perfectly for our short get away in Boston
3377871,37332703,2015-07-06,30705003,Laura,"The location of this room made the price worth it. We were able to walk all over Boston and have our room be central to it all. This is a simple room, as advertised, very clean and Tiffany (property manager) was helpful and very responsive. The only thing I would note is the mattress is very springy (as in you can feel the springs while lying on it) but as long as you are not expecting a hotel experience, this room was great for what we were looking for."
3377871,38191368,2015-07-13,37092594,Vicky,Great overall! Tiffany met us in our arrival and she was great! Gave us detailed information about places and good spots to visit in Boston. even providing us with  printed maps with directions.
Our room #8 was small but perfect for us The shared bathroom was not a problem,we never had to wait to use it.,,,,
- location in Beacon Hill could not be better. We almost walked everywhere and the T (metro) is very close from building. Also there is Whole Foods market very close,and many other places to eat.,,,,
Towels were provided,WIFI worked fine for us. Room has microwave,small refrigerator,sink,A/C,hairdryer
We had a very good time and Boston is beautiful fun place!,,,,,
"We would recommend Tiffany's place to our friends and we'll be happy to come back!!\"",,,,,
3377871,39636174,2015-07-25,35402533,Kirsten,"Tiffany was very welcoming and checked in with us periodically throughout our stay.  The room is in the perfect location in the Beacon Hill neighborhood and it's easy to walk anywhere - about a 40min walk to Fenway.  We didn't have a problem sharing a bathroom (rarely saw anyone on our floor).  The only improvement would be to have a more comfortable mattress as it was quite springy/stiff.  Other than that, it was great."
3377871,40336625,2015-07-30,35686046,Maryse,La location est exactement conforme à ce qui était proposé.
J'étais vraiment ravie du quartier,central et proche de Boston common,et des lignes de métro. J'ai pu tout faire à pied.,,,
C'est une chambre simple avec des commodités propres et surtout très calme.,,,,,
"J'ai passé un très bon séjour grâce à ce lieu de résidence.\"",,,,,
3377871,43829670,2015-08-22,39936824,Sam,Amazing location.  Couldn't be better for the price.  Tiffany was a pleasure to deal with.
3377871,48388848,2015-09-26,37952945,Judith,"Tiffany was very helpful, giving us a map and ideas of places to visit and she gave us a good discount as the room was not quite ready when we arrived. The room was good and clean but there was only one bowl in the room ( we could have asked for another but we made do using a cup instead). Comfortable bed and great to have a microwave.  The shared bathroom was fine even though we had to walk down the hall to it - next time I would choose a private bathroom if possible. The room was quiet except for our last night when the neighbours  (not in the same  building) through an adjoining door played music for hours."
3377871,49451277,2015-10-04,30078664,Marion S,"Great place to stay if you're on a budget! The room was exactly as listed, no surprises. To reiterate what others have said, it is no frills, but very clean (including the shared bathrooms). Mini-fridge is a nice touch and was convenient for leftovers. As others have mentioned, the mattress was a little springy for my taste, but I've had worse. :)  Note for this specific room, you have to schlepp up a few floors. Not a problem for me, but be aware if you have any health issues."
The neighborhood is lovely and very central to lots of Boston sights and the subway.  Super handy to have that Whole Foods and CVS 2 minutes away (especially if you forgot shampoo and flip flops for the shower!).,,,,,
I never met Tiffany,but she was helpful setting up my late check-in and answered a couple of questions for me during my stay via text.,,,,
Overall,great option if you are reluctant to pay the rather insane cost of hotels in downtown Boston!,,,,

We had some troubles with the wifi, tried several but it did not work that well. Also had a problem with the problem, but Tiffany took care of it. Definitely a place to consider for a trip in Boston!"
3377871,54754276,2015-11-23,43715189,Camille,"The appartment is very well located and Tiffany really cares if you need any help. However, the place is more like an hostel than an airbnb. There are many rooms in the building (all to rent) and you do not stay at the local's place (their is even a reception)... a bit far from the airbnb spirit I experienced in my previous stays."

We wish that we had more time to interact with our hosts and learn more about them but we didn't have so much time on our hands to hang around the apartment. Everything was great from the bathroom to the front porch. Orion and his wife were very accommodating and laid back- it was a pleasure to stay with them.

The neighborhood was cute and quiet, with a whole foods and plenty of restaurants within walking distance."
Susan was lovely company and we felt right at home. She provided us with coffee,tea,and various choices of breakfast food,and even sent us home with snacks for the long trek back to CA.,,
The bedroom was spacious,and the pull out bed was very comfortable for the two of us with room to spare.

Susan was very helpful providing  us with restaurant recommendations,directions to the T, and even a map of Boston.  The room was just as it  is pictured on the site ."
"It is  conveniently located;providing easy access to downtown Boston. I highly recommend  bed bath and beyond in Jamaica Plain. \"",,,,,
4015972,22245641,2014-11-02,21953477,Natalia,"I arrived to Boston from Europe for 1 year, and booked airbnb for the first  few days until I settled down. I immediately felt like home in Susan's amazing world! Not only tasteful, clean and comfortable (including shops, T-stop, and even a bike Susan provides), but also heart-warming atmosphere. Quite a contrast to New England's cold and rainy weather I encountered upon arrival."
4015972,22463814,2014-11-07,20853771,Charlotte,"The room was just what I was expecting from the description. The bathroom is shared with three others but was never a problem as everyone seemed to have different schedules. Susan was very welcoming and even stayed a few minutes extra to see me settled before leaving for a previously scheduled appointment (thank you!). I felt very safe in the neighborhood. Some of the surrounding area could be considered a bit intimidating to some but it seemed to be quite a safe neighborhood. I walked to the T station, which was quite close, several times. The apartment is very convenient and the area has a lot of amenities (even a close post office and whole foods nearby). I also cannot say enough about what a truly wonderful, welcoming, warm, generous person Susan is. She even left me a fruit bar on the counter to take with me for breakfast (I had an early flight). Wonderful stay and I would recommend Susan's place without reservation."
4015972,22649646,2014-11-11,2389046,Maryana Y Martin,"Susan es una anfitriona maravillosa, siempre atenta, hospitalaria y con buena energía!"
Cuando llegué me recibió con una excelente cena. Me dio indicaciones y mapas de la ciudad. Me presto su bicicleta,hasta me llevó a recorrer su vecindario.,,,,
Tuvo mucha paciencia con mi español y me enseño mucho sobre ingles y comidas vegetarianas. La casa es muy confortable,el sofá es grande y cómodo.,,,,
Ah,antes salir de casa,preparó para mi viaje una bolsa con frutas y cereales.,,,
Me sentí como en casa de verdad,la mejor experiencia en Boston!,,,,
Recomiendo!,,,,,
"Sin duda volveremos!\"",,,,,
4015972,22980498,2014-11-19,18831381,Shaun,"Susan was just wonderful. She made special arrangements for me to get into the apartment when she couldn't be there to greet me. When we did finally meet, she made me feel right at home in Boston and even took me for a walk around the nearby Jamaica Pond, which is well worth the visit. The area where the flat is located is really convenient: close to some general stores, a Whole Foods, a 7 Eleven, Laundromat and charity shops. The houses are all like they're out of a picture book. The T station is about 5 minutes' walk and from there it's roughly 15/25 minutes into downtown Boston. The bathroom is shared with three others, but this was never an inconvenience. The couch pulls out to be double sized and it's very comfortable. Even though the room is in a living room, it's entirely your own space with a closing door and no one ever comes in unless they're invited. Susan even provides some hangers and cupboard space for you. The real gem of the flat, though, is Susan whose warm and caring personality make you love her to bits in minutes. She will always take time to give you advice about the area and she even lent me her GPS when I rented a car. I would highly recommend staying at Susan's place and would do so again without hesitation."
4015972,23069353,2014-11-22,3751402,Henry,"Susan was a lovely host and I really enjoyed getting to know her and her cute cat. Her place is wonderfully decorated and the bed very comfortable. She shared a wonderful cup of tea with me when I got in and we had a great chat -- sadly I didn't see her more. She also had great breakfast for me to grab in the mornings, which was a big help. Loved my stay!"
4015972,23450454,2014-12-01,23117625,Jorge,"I had a great time at Susana's house! I got to Boston to start working the very next day and stayed for a week until I got a permanent place. The description of the house (shared spaces) and room is accurate, the room is very cozy and perfect for relaxing. The neighborhood is also nice, safe, and has lots of stores and public transportation nearby (red and green line are 5 and 15 mins walk approximately). Besides everything advertised, Susan is a very friendly person who will make you feel at home. She took me and a previous guest for a drive to Plymouth Rock and also cooked a delicious vegetarian meal on thanksgiving. Also she guided me and gave me very useful suggestions and tips to get settled here. She is definitely a responsible host and a good friend to have in Boston."
4015972,23680248,2014-12-08,21651794,Richard,"Susan is very nice, friendly and helpful. Her place is quiet and clean and close to the subway (less than a 10 minute walk). It is easy to find a parking space on the street. It seem  to be a very safe neighborhood. If you are lucky you might get a hot bowl of really  hearty homemade soup."
4015972,24182402,2014-12-22,21410997,Verity,"I absolutely loved staying with Susan! She is such a kind warm welcoming woman. She did everything in her power to make sure I was comfortable an it really felt like home. She even supplied me with soup, diet coke and chocolate! Haha! The property is in perfect location, only a 2 minute or so walk from the nearest whole foods and other shops. For anyone who will be going to Boston Children's it's only a ten minute drive. The room is exactly as pictured and very comfortable indeed. I would definitely stay here again!"
4015972,25438593,2015-01-16,24616838,Antonio,Every traveler should wish to be hosted in Susan's warm nest.
I spent at Susan's the first days after I moved to Boston,before getting permanently settled.,,,,
The apartment is located in the nice neighbourhood of Jamaica Plain,from which you can easily reach Boston downtown in approximately 15 minutes by public transportation. Bus and T stops are nearby and the area is nicely walkable,and you will enjoy walking while exploring it.,,,
The room is spacious and gets a lot of sunlight,and you will be sleeping on a super comfortable queen size couch.,,,,
Susan is a wonderful host. She's  always up to sharing some chats and offering you a cup of hot tea,very much appreciated when it's so freezing outside. She totally knows how to take care of her guests.,,,,
Shuki (the loveliest cat) is the king of the house. Save some special treats for him and make sure you properly cuddle him: he will pay you back with some lovely purr.,,,,,
"Susan's place is definitely where you can feel at home even when you are miles away from it.\"",,,,,

Elle fut le seul rayon de soleil de ma quinzaine bostonienne malheureusement exécrable dûe au temps polaire inhabituel. L'appartement est spacieux et la chambre également, la cuisine est très grande et la chambre a bonne température."
4015972,27048236,2015-02-24,4259154,Christine,"Susan is a gift of a host! She is one of the most caring, kind, warm people I have met. She went out of her way to make my stay as wonderful as possible. From the moment I made contact with Susan, she made me feel at ease, calm, respected. She is the perfect representation of what Airbnb is all about."
4015972,27599244,2015-03-08,25694917,Jayakumar,"Susan is a lovely host who loves people,cooking and Shuki ;-) We had a fun week in her cosy living room...and she truly made it memorable with the little get together we had on the night before we (URL HIDDEN) was like a 'miniature world in her living room' with 9 of us from 8 different countries!!!We loved the time we spent with her in the kitchen cooking Indian food...she is a passionate cook and is terrific in the kitchen! The neighborhood is great too...you have an array of shops right near by and so is the subway which gets you to downtown (URL HIDDEN) not far from the Longwood Medical area either. We would definitely stay there if we visit Boston again:-)"
4015972,28394109,2015-03-23,4259154,Christine,OH SUSAN! She's the BEST! I cannot say how much I love staying with her.  This was my second trip for 9 days. Incredible. She's incredible. She room is very peaceful. Highly recommend.
4015972,28602875,2015-03-27,26609928,Margaret,I could not have hoped for a better host. I felt very welcome and comfortable in Susan's home. She has a warm personality and provided all the amenities described plus more.  I highly recommend staying with her if you are visiting Boston.
Jamaica Plain is a vibrant neighborhood with many shops,a grocery store (Whole Foods) and restaurants very close to Susan's place. The nearby pond was a nice place for a Sunday stroll. Her place is very accessible to public transportation.,,,,

4015972,32059340,2015-05-13,9653284,Alison,Susan made a fantastic healthy steel cut oatmeal and had plenty of fresh fruit and Chobani yogurts available. She offered me a late meal after I arrived at midnight from a crisis the country flight. She also lent me her bicycle and drove me to the Arboretum one evening.
“My stay with Susan was delightful. I spent a week in her friendly presence and am so grateful to have found a cheery,clean and welcoming accommodation as well a friend with a kindred spirit,"a fellow world traveler and a fantastic whole food chef! I would recommend her Airbnb to anyone wanting a the comforts of home in charming Jamaica Plains. ”\"",,,

Her room is decorated with all kinds of cat things(such as toy and pillow)so it will be a cute experience if uou are fund of cats. Also,the neibourhood is wonderful!Quite safe and peaceful,full of beautiful colourful houses!I love this place and hope to see Susan again!"
4015972,32507203,2015-05-19,28872340,Alan And Hannah,Susan's place was the perfect choice to transition from the chaos of travel to the serenity of Jamaica Plain.
The room looks and feels exactly the way it is depicted. Sunny,"bright and cheerful. Decorated by Susan's eclectic expertise.\"",,,,
4015972,32553356,2015-05-19,18396057,Joshua,"Susan was *extremely* rude to my girlfriend and I. She did not inform me that there would be construction during our stay - she did, however, demand that I pay her an extra $20/night in cash. When I declined, she incessantly harassed us; it got to the point that we had to leave one night early (despite already having paid) and we would have contacted the local authorities were it not for help from the AirBNB trust and safety team. If she makes a similar demand from you, do NOT oblige it - report her to AirBNB and leave *immediately*"
4015972,32691384,2015-05-20,1230678,Yelena,"Yes, everything is accurate. The flat is lovely, a temple of cat worship! It is like a cat museum, maybe one day? I regret not having enough time to see all the kitties: wooden, chine, painted and sculpted. Felt very at home and relaxed. Susan is very sweet. The place is also perfect for those visiting the loved ones at the Faulkner hospital or Hebrew Senior Center."
4015972,32796215,2015-05-21,5187943,Joshua,"Really enjoyed my brief stay with Susan. I would highly recommend staying with Susan if you are visiting Boston. You can easily get to museums, parks, businesses, the waterfront, etc., but then you come back to a nice quiet (and fun) neighborhood and comfortable room."
I was in the middle of a move from Jamaica Plain to Cambridge,so I'm local,and I can say this is a great area. On the 5-10 minute (depending if you have luggage) walk to the T (the subway; the Orange Line,which goes through Northeastern University and onto Downtown,and connects easily with the Blue Line to the airport),there are two convenient establishments: a liquor store
Susan was really great about my hectic and odd schedule; sadly,we didn't get much time to chat. Her cat is very nice,but I'm slightly allergic; I had no problems at all,so I can say that Susan keeps the place clean even beyond the visible. She also completely understood my allergy and kept the cat from the room.,,
While Susan was not there when I woke the next morning (I slept in a bit),she had a kitchen stocked with food available for breakfast,and left me a note to that effect.,,,
Two comments,not really criticisms: first,the bed,as she notes,is a pull-out sofa,but I found it comfortable
4015972,33692949,2015-05-31,32122554,Ameeta,"I stayed at Susan’s place for four nights. I was greeted by her, very warmly on arrival,  with an extremely welcome cold drink.. much needed in the unbearable heat. We had a very interesting conversation- I could see she was very fond of India, and everything Indian, including the food. Many such conversations followed during my stay at her place, and I felt totally at home. Shuki was a friendly flatmate too, and totally kept to himself, without causing any trouble at all."
The place is extremely comfortable,the room spacious and sunny,and all needs are very well taken care of. The location is excellent-everything is within walking distance,i.e. the T-station,the bus stop,Whole Foods
Susan was the perfect host. She would provide a sumptuous breakfast of cereal,yoghurt and fruit. Tea coffee,etc. could be had round the clock,with free access to the kitchen anytime,and the deck too. I must mention the delicious biryani and Moroccan soup that Susan shared with me. She gives the key on arrival,so one can independently enter and exit
I would highly recommend the bnb accommodation,not just for the comforts it provides,but also for the feeling of warmth and belongingness it gives. Listing is (URL HIDDEN) fact,more comfortable than stated. I would definitely like to stay with Susan,whenever I visit Boston again.,

4015972,34145750,2015-06-05,10752051,Alice,"Susan is a very considerate, thoughtful and sweet host. She leaves the privacy to the guests, but she also is very willing to talk to us. She made my trip in Boston beautiful. The first two days when I got to the city was drizzling all the time. Susan borrowed her umbrella, showed the place and Shuki( her cute cat) to me.  The place is very clean and full of artistic cat decorations. Wish I can still come back to visit someday."
4015972,34290660,2015-06-07,30432154,Liliane,"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour chez Susan. Malgré notre retard, elle a eu la gentillesse de nous accueillir. La chambre était confortable et tous les éléments étaient à notre disposition (drap, serviette, petit déjeuner). L'appartement est idéalement situé à côté d'une station de métro. Nous avons apprécié pouvoir bavarder avec notre hôte, et son chat est très mignon ! Susan est très attentive à nos besoins, c'est une belle rencontre."
4015972,34786326,2015-06-12,30921101,Ashley,It was a nice quiet place to sleep and could come and go when I needed. Thank you Susan for a wonderful first experience on Airbnb.

I like the room, kitchen, bathroom, balcony which are full of sunshine, color and interesting cats decoration. The bed is comfortable and you can use milk frother to have a starbucks at home~ Susan is very kind to remind me that there will be some activities tomorrow which is worth to join and she also show me the peaceful morning time at balcony. Oh, she have a clever cat Suki, who is elegant like a king. If I go back to Boston, I will choose Susan without any hesitate :  )"

Warm hugs from me!"
4015972,36861078,2015-07-02,30372290,Rebekah,"Susan was very nice and friendly. I was out exploring the city most of the time, so didn't spend too much time with Susan, but every interaction we did have was enjoyable. She made sure I knew where everything is and had everything I needed including multiple guide books of Boston! There was no AC, but an open window did just fine to keep the room cool in June. Overall, great first airbnb experience! Would stay again with Susan :)"
4015972,37113414,2015-07-04,3059183,Balazs,"Susan is an incredibly kind and witty, genuine Airbnb host. I enjoyed talking to her a lot and I enjoyed her cozy, spacious and comfortable house where I felt home from the moment that I arrived. For me the original concept of Airbnb - that has become a huge commercial business organization over the past years - is somehow preserved by such very few hosts around the globe like Susan. All the rest practical infos have been shared by many other reviewers, so I will not repeat them, I'll just say simply that this is an ideal place for all Airnbnb travellers."
4015972,41729946,2015-08-09,14760854,Rose,"Susan was out of town during my stay so I went to collect the keys a few days before I moved in. The house was about 10 mins walk from the orange line, there was also free street parking, which was convenient. The room was nice, the pull-over couch made a decent size bed. The only downside was that door of the room was hard to close."
Overall,"it was a nice experience. Susan was available through email during my stay but I wish she was in the house because I'd love to hear  some life stories from a person with such a lovely home. \"",,,,

Although she was not there during my mom's stay, almost everything was cared for; I visited her before she left and she gave my some instructions on how everything works. I was also very easy and uncomplicated to communicate with Susan."
The location of the apartment is very good. You can reach public transport very fast to go downtown Boston.,,,,,

The house is a bit of an uphill hike from the metro station, so keep that in mind if you have a lot to carry or have physical limitations."
4015972,47707637,2015-09-21,36368365,Beate,Susan is a lovely and interesting person and the flat she lives in is exactly as described. It's a very nice part of Boston and has a lot of character. Nice and quiet but still close to the next train station to get to downtown Boston. It's nice to sit on the balcony in the morning to have you first cup of coffee. Susan is very environmentally conscious which I appreciate a lot. We were very like-minded which made my my stay with hrer even more pleasurable.

I was kept company by the handsome Shuki on the rare occasions I was in on my own,and I was surrounded by so many fascinating books that I will have to return sometime just to read the ones I missed!,,,,
The property is a short walk from the T station and a 15 minute ride downtown so convenient for all the usual tourist sites without being stuck in the middle of a city.,,,,,
I really enjoyed my stay and would heartily recommend Bed,Bath and Beyond to other Air BnB members,,,,

She lives in a traditional New England house in a very quiet,green and clean neighborhood which happens to still be very accessible by metro (ca. 20mins from Downtown Boston).,,,,
This was an amazing experience as Susan is a very well-versed,forthcoming and interseting person,and we shared interesting conversations. She also tells you about one some of her favorite books and gives you teh opportunity to read them yourself. Furthermore she provides useful information about Boston and has numerous city guides at the disposal of guests.,,,

Not to forget handsome Shuki who would call in every now and then. Susan would go out of her way to make you feel comfortable, and make sure you had everything you needed. Her place is also very convenient, being about 7 minutes away from the T-stop, and also close to 2 major grocery stores. I would definitely recommend staying with Susan, and would love to pop by again if I am ever back in Boston."

She's very respectful of privacy, but always has a willing ear should you find yourself in need of one.  I stayed with her for two weeks while waiting for my apartment to be ready, and I was able to have some of my things shipped to her address that I couldn't yet have delivered to my place, which was terribly convenient."

4015972,66459701,2016-03-22,21402534,Jenny,"Susan's place was a true home away from home during our trip. The room was nice and cozy and our dear host was the loveliest, making sure we were all set for anything. Could not have found a better place!"

4015972,68664306,2016-04-06,51580174,Lauren,Susan is awesome and her place is too! It's a short walk to the train.. Safe and easy to locate. Great experience! Wifi and a tv in the room. A win!
4015972,73414747,2016-05-08,16635699,Ellese,Susan was an amazing host! The room was perfect in a great neighborhood. Would absolutely love to stay here again!
4015972,74460178,2016-05-15,46500920,Ian,"Susan was really friendly and accommodating. I had a fever at the beginning of my stay, and Susan checked in on me and provided me with cold medicine. The room was cozy, and there were a lot of movie channels on the TV which was nice to have while recovering from my illness. Another plus about the place was free street parking right in front of Susan's home. Overall, great experience."
4015972,75040967,2016-05-18,4602553,Becca,"Susan is a superb host - attentive, considerate, friendly, and welcoming. I stayed with her for two nights on my way to a trip to New England, and returned for another night on my way back. Susan's place is full of character and charm. Its artistic decor and vibe, and Susan's easy hospitality immediately made me feel at home. The bedroom has lovely light and is graced with lush plants and a plethora  of eclectic books -- including a comprehensive, diverse collection of Boston-New England guidebooks. Also, the sofa-couch is surprisingly comfortable. Highly recommended."
4015972,75645196,2016-05-22,38936766,Erin,"I stayed with Susan for two nights during a three-night trip to Boston and the South Shore for a wedding. I found her to be a kind and accommodating host, and communication with her was clear prior to and during the stay. She called me to coordinate a check-in time after I had gotten confused about the times on the listing, and she was flexible when the estimated arrival time changed due to a decision to take the T from the airport rather than an Uber. (As a side note, I'd recommend doing that if you are flying to Boston because it was cheap and likely faster than a car would have been.) Also, Susan remembered that I had mentioned needing an iron and brought one, along with a small ironing board, to the room. I was impressed by that!"
The accommodations were clean and exactly as described,and the neighborhood seemed safe. The bed was surprisingly comfortable for a pull-out couch,and it seemed larger than a standard full-sized bed in both length and width. It's worth noting that,while the house that her apartment in is a short walk from the Stony Brook T station,much of that walk is uphill (per (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps walking directions,at least). So
Overall,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying with Susan and would do it again without hesitation. I found her to be a lovely person and enjoyed talking with her (although I do wish I'd had more time to chat!). \"",,,,
4015972,77119867,2016-05-30,65293797,Genaro,"The house is well located, near to Stony Brook T Station. The room is confortable. There is breakfast available. But the best of this house is Susan and her cat. She is an amazing person!"
4015972,78696722,2016-06-08,24914983,Monica,"Susan is a warm and attentive host who made sure all my needs were met. The room was fine and I loved the comfortable reclining armchair. Wifi connection in the room and elsewhere in the home was perfect. There's a Whole Foods natural food store within walking distance, and the T is also within short walking distance. There's plenty of hot water for showers, and the shower head is good. Thank you, Susan!"
4015972,79783708,2016-06-14,13505075,Alex M.,Susan is a fantastic host! She's thoughtful and willing to help solve questions that you may encounter while staying in Boston in a timely manner.

She was very flexible about my arrival time, which was a big help. Susan had some great recommendations on things to see and places to eat in the neighborhood as well. The room itself was cozy, bright, and I got a great night's sleep. If you're looking to stay near JP or just want a quiet location with easy travel within the Boston area, this is a great place to stay."

Spent over a week doing research all over the area (without a car) including in Cambridge and found the place and public transportation perfectly convenient.  Thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Jamaica Plain as well. As many have said before, the stay is a gem because of the kindness of the host. Thank you for the kind hospitality!"
4015972,84061128,2016-07-05,32714937,Emily,Susan was such a delight! I had a fantastic stay and loved visiting with her. She was so charming. Her cat was supper sweet as well.

The flat is close to the metro station and to a whole foods supermarket.,,,,,
The neighbourhood is safe and looks really nice.,,,,,
We had an AC unit and a fan in our room so that we could sleep despite the heat outside.,,,,,
The rooms are clean and we even had the opportunity to do or laundry.,,,,,

4015972,89415003,2016-07-28,10028694,Sarah,Had such a lovely stay at Susan's home! It felt warmly comfortable and happily lived in and I slept like a dream. Susan was incredibly communicative throughout the whole process and a very warm and receptive host! The location was easily accessible by public transit and there are several restaurants/bars within walking distance of the apartment. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Boston!
4015972,89950424,2016-07-30,18543204,Bjørn Kiilsgaard,"Susan is a very attentive and welcoming host - Our stay with her felt just like visiting and out-of-town relative - as she provided open arms, great local hints and interesting insights on local history and culture :) Yes - we will recommend Susan as your home for your next Boston trip!"
4015972,90943474,2016-08-03,42948597,Matt And Tamara,No wonder she has such terrific reviews!
It appeared as we expected.  The bed was so cozy - the entire house was!  We felt very much at home (even enjoyed a glass of wine on the back porch).,,,,,
The neighbourhood was beautifully eclectic and we felt like we were residents taking our walks.  A short walk away (approx 1.5 kms) was centre street with many shops and restaurants.   Our two favorites were Wonder Spice (fantastic Pad Thai) and Ten Tables (upscale food and wine).,,,,,
If we had any questions,Susan was always immediate to respond.  We appreciated the sense of responsibility it takes to keep connected in case she is needed.,,,,
She was definitely meant to be around people.  She is warm and thoughtful.   This trip was for our birthdays that are so close together.  Susan had a card and small box of delicious cookies to say Happy Birthday.,,,,,

I looked for a place with parking yet close to the T, and this place was great. The room was quiet, the bed comfortable and there's plenty of parking outside. The orange line T is a short walk and I was in Boston quickly."

The neighborhood is awesome: energetic,vibrant and with many bars,pubs ans shops. And you'll have the waterfront just a block away.,,,
The apartment is modern and well equipped. It's also huge,relatively speaking,for just two. You have 4 definite spaces in the room: coach,table,kitchen and bed,with generous space all between them.

8310660,54741660,2015-11-23,47228478,Dylan,"I found it to be very accurate to the listing. It was exactly what I needed and he even worked with on the price to stay within my budget (longer than normal stay). I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean, no frills type place to stay at a good price. The only thing is, expect the possibility of other AirBnB guests staying here while you are, and not the host. For the first night or two the host was home, after that it was other guests. Although I never even saw them. Not at all an inconvenience to me, personally."
The host made it a point to work with me for my late arrival,and made it easy to get in from my very late red-eye flight,"and was even there well past midnight to greet me upon my arrival. I thought this would have proved to be more difficult. \"",,,

The building is in a beautiful neighborhood, only a stone's throw from Fenway Park. Anna had perfect check-in instructions, and everything was just as it appeared in the photographs. The bed was also very comfortable. Anna checked in periodically to ensure that everything was okay. My wife and I could not have been more pleased. To be honest, I didn't want to leave too many good comments, so that this could be our own little get-away place! :) Once the word is out . . . this place will be booked all of the time. When we return one day, we will be calling on Anna again!"
6317304,40328968,2015-07-30,34378934,Ronny,"We had a great time in this place. The location is perfect: The T (Boston subway) is right behind the house, Star-Market, Whole Foods and a newly opened Target is 5-10 min walking distance. I had to do work at Boston University (5 min walk) and Brigham and Women's (15-20 min), and I loved to be able go home quickly after a long working day. The apartment is very clean and well equipped, has fast wireless internet, a huge TV, a comfortable large bed, a crib for our daughter etc., and the kitchen has everything you need to prepare your own meals; the dishwasher looks a bit antique but works perfectly. Anna, our host, is very friendly and responded to questions within a short period of time. She left us many toys that our 2-year old enjoyed during our stay. Anna also left notes on the appliances with helpful operating instructions so we did not have to figure things out ourselves. For us, the only drawback of the apartment was the house elevator: we could not enter it with our stroller and one needs both hands to open the two elevator doors. However, this was a problem only when being alone with the baby after shopping and one has to bring everything upstairs."
6317304,40953176,2015-08-03,1666605,Jodi,"What a great place! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Anna's. The apartment is in a quiet, well-maintained old building with tons of character (including a cool, but tricky elevator!) and within a short walk of Fenway Park, Whole Foods, Target and two T stops. It was incredibly clean and tidy and we felt right at home very quickly. It was so handy to have a crib, change pad and toys for our seven-month-old. The place was quite warm when we arrived (since it was 32C outside!) but cooled off quickly once the window units were on. Anna's friend Jay was easy to get a hold of and responded immediately to help us figure out the cable TV. He was friendly and seemed ready to help with anything! We loved Boston and walked almost everywhere from Anna's apartment. We especially enjoyed walking along the Esplanade and the Commonwealth Mall on our way downtown. Highly recommended!"

The location was perfect.  Very close to the fenway area (walking),with many restaurants to choose from.  Also,super convenient to the green line which will take you just about anywhere in the city.,,,

6317304,42989856,2015-08-16,29650948,Shami,This was our first AirBnB experience. Our host was very accommodating with early access to drop off our luggage. We used the keybox to get access and left the keys in the suite on departure and had little contact with the host. The suite was definitely bigger than expected and clean.
It was a great part of town and a short walk to Fenway,shopping,transit,etc.,,

It was clean, in a great location, and had lots of natural light.  The old-school elevator was really cool and came in very handy for our luggage. The heating system throughout kept the place nice and cozy at night. We rented a car one day and were relieved to find plenty of metered street parking right out front (which was free overnight of course)."

It is bright, beautifully put together, and comfortable. The elevator is, as noted, a bit funky - I assume it is the original elevator, dating from an earlier era. Fortunately, it is easy to walk up and down the stairs. The location is incredibly convenient - anything not in walking distance is an easy ride on the T. Thank you, Anna!"

L'edificio in stile bostoniano si trova in un bel quartiere,a 5-6 minuti a piedi da Kenmore Square: Green T line,negozi,bar,ristoranti tutto a portata di mano.,
La casa è davvero luminosa e accogliente e molto molto spaziosa. Le foto rispecchiano benissimo la reale situazione. In particolare ho apprezzato la grandezza della camera da letto (il letto comodissimo)  e la funzionalità della cucina (lavastoviglie,forno a microonde,macchina per caffè americano,stoviglie di tutti i tipi). Anche il televisore è davvero grande e moderno. E,,
In particolare io ho adorato la presenza del pianoforte.,,,,,

It is within a couple minutes walk to the Green line, Fenway or St Mary's stops.  Great coffee shop down the way, Tattes, and a lovely boutique spa, the Southwest Day Spa along Beacon right next to Whole foods. It made cooking meals a breeze and lots of restaurants nearby as well. Anna was quick to reply as mid-stay we needed to extend our stay.  We were really lucky!  The apartment is comfy, clean, and safe.   We hope to stay at Anna's again!"

St Mary's street T stop, Tatte and Whole Foods are very close and from the T stop you can get anywhere in Boston in no time. Anna was very responsive and helpful. However, apartment furniture is a little bit old and worn-out. The building also needs some renovation: the elevator has no character: it is old and smelly. We are really thankful to Anna for contacting and helping us when we have some problems with major construction noise underneath the apartment."
6317304,69430737,2016-04-11,3131471,Amanda,"My friend and I had a lovely 2 week stay! Anna's place was spacious and quiet, with lots of light and old Boston charm. It's right between 2 different T lines (Fenway stop on the D train and St. Mary's stop on the C) and is walking distance to plenty of grocery stores, restaurants, bars, cafes, etc. The kitchen is well-stocked with cooking utensils (which I always appreciate). The host was very accomodating and easy to reach, but never hovered. I'd be happy to stay here again any time I'm in Boston!"

Photos and and descriptions in the listing are accurate. Unbeatable location in Fenway/Brookline. The elevator is nostalgic, but I did not experience any difficulty using it. Easy check-in and -out process. Fully equipped kitchen and rooms. Overall, I had a pleasant and worry-free stay and highly recommend to future travelers, especially those with young kids."

Sunlight in the bedroom every morning woke us up early enough to get a good start on our day.  All of the appliances we used worked flawlessly and we were very grateful for the reliable wifi.  Getting the key from the lock box was a bit of a process in the dark (we arrived about 10 pm) but property manager Jay was accessible,helpful,and patient with questions.,,,
The apartment was an easy T ride from Back Bay Amtrak station; South Station was a slightly longer trip.  Everything we could want was within easy walking distance: Kenmore Square restaurants; another fun restaurant (Audobon) half a block away; and Japonaise bakery,Dunkin Donuts,and Whole Foods for our breakfast needs.,,,

6317304,81198154,2016-06-21,306959,Bora,Everything is provided as advertised. The house everything that one can need. The location is pretty central and close to everywhere.
One note if you have a car with you is that,it is pretty difficult to park your car since there is not much place to park if you don't have a permit. Just be aware.,,,,

The check in process was easily explained and it was only a few minute walk from the T stop. Host was responsive and easy to get ahold of. Thanks for everything!"
6317304,81999706,2016-06-26,72951659,Christina,Great place!
Host was very accommodating as our flight arrived earlier than their listed check-in time. They allowed us to drop bags early and were very gracious.,,,,,

6317304,82941763,2016-06-30,24386187,Jj,"I absolutely enjoyed my stay at Anna's apartment. The description was accurate to a T, and the instructions were clear and concise. It's located in a pleasant neighborhood, incredibly convenient (Fenway train station is minutes away) with shops, restaurants and so on all a quick stroll away too. Special mention to the absolutely stunning job of furnishing and decorating the apartment. And my thanks to Anna and Jay for accommodating my changed (delayed) flight plans, and being responsive throughout my stay. I cannot recommend this cozy apartment and its owners enough."
6317304,84422933,2016-07-07,9898789,Leah & Adam,"Overall Anna's place was convenient, clean, and in a good location - however it does come with some quirks. We arrived very late and were able to get the key to her building from a lockbox outside, but it didn't work very easily on the front door. It took a lot of practice to get it to work due to the old locks on the building. Also, the elevator was being worked on while we were there so we had to walk up 3 flights of stairs most of the time we were there. If you're okay with some quirks, then this is still a good stay but I don't know if it would be convenient enough for everyone."
The apartment is on the 4th floor. It's spacious and clean and has a nice shower! The apartment is also very close to Fenway Park,so if you're planning on going to a game this is an ideal location.,,,,
We stayed in early July so it was very hot and humid in Boston. The apartment had 2 AC units in the windows but they are very loud and don't provide much cooling while you're sleeping. If this place had a couple fans it would have made our stay much nicer. Overall,"we still enjoyed staying at Anna's place and would recommend to anyone who wants to find a good deal and doesn't mind dealing with a few quirks!\"",,,,

6317304,86035951,2016-07-14,30736926,Johnny,"Wow what a great apartment,  close to anything and Anna was a fantastic host"
6317304,87188486,2016-07-19,21569825,David,Anna's place was AMAZING. It has several things going for it:
1) location,Location,LOCATION! Steps from Fenway,Boston University,and all that Bean Town has to offer.,
2) Space! Especially for an apartment in the Fenway area,you never feel cramped. (During my stay,I was apartment hunting and saw a lot of properties in the area - none had as much space or sunlight as hers!),,,
3) Creature comforts. Great high-speed internet,a full kitchen,even instruments for the musically inclined. It's a convenient place to crash if you want to try and see everything Boston has to offer,but simultaneously a cozy pad that makes it hard to leave.,,
For anyone looking to visit BU,catch a game at Fenway,or enjoy the charm and history of Boston,"this is the place to be!\"",,
6317304,87664726,2016-07-21,69259868,Matty,Everything was very nice! My parents enjoyed staying there. Great experience!
6317304,89650718,2016-07-29,81001237,Laurie,"If you want to stay VERY close to Fenway to catch some games, then Anna’s is the place to be!  We could see on the map that Anna’s was close to the stadium, but we didn’t realize how close her place was until we looked out her window and could see the lights from Fenway!"
Our experience at Anna’s couldn’t be better!  Anna was very quick to respond when booking the trip and asking questions.  Jay was our contact the week leading up to the trip and during our stay.  He was very quick to respond to any questions we had and also reached out to us during our stay multiple times to see how we were doing and if we needed anything.  The apartment is just like you see in the pictures…spacious,sunny and very homey.  We loved the character and charm of the building (including the elevator).  The lockbox and keys can require some patience,but after a day we got the hang of it.  We really felt at home with a comfy bed and pillows,good shower,separate kitchen and living room space.  The window a/c’s worked well,it just takes a little while for the place to cool down.  Our recommendation is to close the bedroom door to help the bedroom cool quicker when sleeping at night.  It was in the mid 90’s during our stay
Anna’s is very close to two train stations,although much of Boston is very walk-able.  We walked from the North End and from Back Bay back to Anna’s.  You really do NOT need a car.  We did Uber it a few times only because we were hot and tired after a long day,but we took the train a few times and mostly walked.  There are also many of the conveniences very close by (restaurants,CVS,Whole Foods,etc).
Across the street from Anna’s was Audubon Bar.  Nicholas and J,who both were working at Audubon that day,were very welcoming to us and gave us suggestions on places to go and things to do.,,,
Anna and Jay were very accommodating with our schedule and luggage which made our travel days much easier.  Overall,it was a wonderful experience staying at Anna’s.  They were patient with our questions,accommodating,very responsive and of course had a beautiful,clean,spacious and homey place to stay.  There is nothing negative we could come up with!  There is no doubt we will book her place again if we make it back out to Boston.
Thanks to Anna and Jay and their accommodations,we felt like we were living in Boston,"not just visiting it!\"",,,
6317304,92882187,2016-08-10,18226210,Taryn,"We had a pleasant stay at Anna's bright, clean and spacious apartment! The apartment is an 8 minute walk to Fenway and close to BU.  Getting to the common is walkable but we took quick and inexpensive uber rides there to beat the heat.  Anna provides concise instructions for check in making the process easy and she is quick to respond to inquiries. Parking can be tricky but, Jay helped by making great recommendations and we were able to park for free for our stay."
Additionally,"the bed is comfortable and shower is nice.  Since there is a lot of natural light the apartment does get warm. Window AC units do not cool down much but do make it better.  We recommend Anna's apartment especially if visiting Fenway park. \"",,,,

And the piano and the guitar make this place even better. We came across a blackout on the first night we arrived, but it was the whole street and was sovled after within 5 hours. Jay and Anna are very helpful and approachable. We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and will come back again!"
6317304,95990868,2016-08-21,75551573,Nathan,"My Fiancé and I were in town for an event at Fenway Park and wanted to stay someplace close.  Anna's place did not let us down one bit!  A very close walk to the park, train stop, etc.  it is also a short walk to the Charles River where you can walk and run along the wonderful path on the water.  She has a great kitchen where we cooked breakfast each morning.  Very clean and we would for sure rent this apartment again!"

The host gave us all the information we needed and the place itself was clean and comfortable. I was not happy with the location,however.

After initially not receiving any help with the 24 hour management company,Dror was quick to respond after I contacted him directly.  We agreed on revised terms for the price,as we really didn't have any better options for a location,it already being late Saturday afternoon on a warm May weekend in Boston.,,
While I appreciate Dror's handling of the mix-up,I will likely try and avoid airbnb rentals that involve owners of multiple properties in the future.  If a mixup happens with a hotel,they usually will have a number of options for you.  If it happens with a small airbnb mgmt company,there's not much that can be done.,,
That said,the unit we stayed in was on Moon St,and would be a nice option for two couples.  Its clean,updated,and in a nice location - steps from the Paul Revere House and all the shops/restaurants on Hanover,but on a quiet side street.  The one drawback is that there is basically no common area in the unit.  It is two bedrooms (each with a bath

It's clean and spacious and comfortably slept three of us, with enough space to leave the fold out bed folded out during the day, and there were still couches available for seating. It had pretty much everything we needed but with unusually steep stairs and uneven floors, may not suit an older person or someone who isn't sure-footed.

The first one, Duane st apartment 2c, was centrally located, near some great Italian restaurants and close to a playground, a nice touch as we were traveling with two young children.   The apartment faces out on a fairly busy Boston street, and unfortunately the window AC units were still installed when we were there, contributing to noise and cold/draftiness at night; I think once the AC units are removed and the space sealed up a bit, noise and cold might be less of an issue."
The second apartment where we stayed,Moon St,was really lovely.  Very aesthetic,nicely decorated. There was tea and coffee for us to enjoy,a nice touch which I do appreciate.   Spacious.  Beautiful space.  Great location.  Really enjoyed our stay in this particular apartment.,

1220971,60025053,2016-01-18,2479114,John,"Dror's place was pretty decent in a really bustling and convenient location. He was easy to deal with and responsive. His property management staff were also helpful and friendly. The space is a good size and accommodated me and three other average sized adults pretty well. We had plenty of towels and extra bedding. There is a full kitchen and fridge if you want to cook and/store perishable goods. It's just a few blocks from Boston Public Market. There are excellent Italian restaurants and bakeries everywhere, so you'll probably need to store leftovers at the very least. There is a king sized bed, so if someone doesn't like sleeping on the couch it's easy to double up. If you do sleep with another person hopefully you're a heavy sleeper because every little movement by the other person feels like a minor earthquake. Also, bring earplugs because you'll hear every footstep of the upstairs neighbors and every word spoken by people passing on the street below. The WI-FI was unusable. We were able to connect with the info provided, but it was just excruciatingly slow. Data worked much faster. Lastly, there aren't many outlets because it's an old building, so you may want to bring a power strip. Overall, it's a decent value."

His directions for check-in, acquiring the key and parking were clear and accurate, very smooth. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures and is accurately described. One thing I didn't fully appreciate was the AC. The apartment building, according to Dror's information, is over 100 years old; it does not have central AC. Window units are installed seasonally. See later in the review why this was relevant for an early spring stay. While the building itself is old, the interior of the apartment had modern fixtures and appliances and everything we used worked fine. We were there for a multi-day event at the TD garden and didn't use wi-fi much and never turned on the TV. The location for our needs was great, a short & safe walk to the Garden. The bed was comfortable, the apartment was clean. The only issue we had was noise. The apartment was quite warm. With the windows open, the temperature was comfortable, but it let in a lot of street noise. There is a fire house almost directly across the street and had at least one call for each night we were there. It sounded like the truck was driving through the apartment. We also heard people talking and yelling all night. When we closed the windows the next night, we realized that the voices we were hearing each night were form the apartment above, We could hear every step they took and every word they said. Unfortunately they were night owls; once when they woke me up I noted it was 4 AM. We chose to drive home after the last event at the Garden and didn't stay the last night in the apartment. I realize this is beyond the control of the host, just an unfortunate situation. I'm not sure if/when I'd need an apartment in that neighborhood again, but if I did I'd most likely look elsewhere."

La posizione è' in una delle zone più caratteristiche di Boston piena di locali e di ristoranti tipici davvero italiani in cui mangiare. Una lavanderia sulla strada è' comodissima in caso di viaggi un po' più lunghi. Casa silenziosa, ideale da utilizzare come base per scoprire la città."

El sistema de llegada y salida muy eficiente, ya que te dan códigos de acceso y no tienes que coordinar la entrega de llaves. Depto limpio y con todo lo necesario. A nosotros no nos funcionó el aire acondicionado y el Depto es un poco caluroso (solo se abre una ventana) y no había tostador de pan."

10434883,79108191,2016-06-11,71744859,Cameron,We loved our room. The location was just the best. Lots of restaurants and everything within walking distance. The only issues was the toilette was not bolted to the floor very well so it moved around some. The host was amazing. Arranged early check in as we took a red eye and stored our luggage too. Would stay here again.
10434883,80723053,2016-06-19,38746741,Jennifer,"This flat is located in an incredible neighborhood.

10434883,84850862,2016-07-09,54911944,Cody,Great little place just off of the south end of Charles Street. Having a full kitchen makes it helpful to keep takeout from all the great restaurants nearby.
10434883,86346305,2016-07-16,74568544,Claire,"We loved the location of this property. Right in the heart of Beacon Hill we were just a stroll away from a choice of 3 lovely cafes for breakfast. At the end of the main road (about 5 min walk) is Boston common and gardens, great for a run in the mornings! We were emailed access codes so we never met any hosts, and we didn't have any problems so we can't comment on their availability. The studio is a great size for a couple and had everything we needed for a short stay. Would definitely recommend."

10434883,91611294,2016-08-06,67711186,Brianne,We had a great experience.  The location cannot be beat and the keyless entry made it very easy to access!  Early or late checkin/out would be nice but we made due.  It was very well kept and was a great spot for us to call home temporarily in Boston.
10434883,92237366,2016-08-08,75234005,Julie,The condo itself was cute and clean. However I don't see how it got a five star rating and this is why but it could have been bad timing:
1. We could never figure out how to turn the bathroom lights on over mirror so I had to put make up on by the dim lit light on ceiling in bath.,,,,,
2. At 8:10am on Saturday and 9:20am on Sunday there was hammering and an electric saw that woke us up and kept going through the morning.,,,,,
3. When any door shuts in the building  it slams so we heard that periodically.,,,,,
4. You had to park in a deck which was about a 5 min walk from apartment. That part was fine but the 46 bucks a day to park there was not.,,,,,
"The up side is it was a cute unit and location was great! Very safe area. \"",,,,,

Was a quick 5-8 minute s place I felt at home! He had the futon open with sheets already on and even left a clean towel and shampoo/ body wash for me to use (Awesome touch!).  The next morning I walked a few short blocks to the train and took it one stop up to catch the free shuttle to the airport. You will not be disappointed in your stay and I recommend without a doubt! Thanks Adam!

He was kind enough to give me rides into the city each day so I wouldn't have to pay for parking! Adam is very personable and is willing to talk with you, or leave you alone if that's what you prefer. His cat is very friendly and loves the shaower. (Even though he has a cat, there is NO cat box smell AT ALL. He keeps his place very clean!) Free parking on street, not a bad part of town. This was my first time booking with airbnb but Adam made it a wonderful experience."

He is friendly, but also let me get to work when I had to prepare for my meetings the next day.  Very convenient location in an area that is much improved from when I lived in Boston 20 years ago.  For example, on my last trip a month ago, I actually came to this neighborhood from Quincy to eat at a Salvadoran restaurant that was fabulous.   Interesting neighborhood now, great Hispanic food choices, especially.   A short walk to the T and then 2 stops on the Blue Line to State Street--super convenient for any activities in central Boston or Cambridge.  And the airport is walking distance, but the flight path doesn't go over this neighborhood so you don't hear the planes.  The place itself is a little shabby, although not dirty.  But the bed was fine, the location seems safe, it is super convenient and Adam is nice.  For this price, such a deal!"

6142396,57143157,2015-12-22,47213077,Fabienne,Adam answered right away when I had any questions. His place is very close to the airport and therefore good when you have an early flight.
6142396,57351708,2015-12-24,27113718,Thomas,"Adam was a great host, he waited for me even though my plane landed around 1 AM and welcomed me. His place is perfect if you are getting into the Boston airport."
6142396,59667266,2016-01-13,53456966,Dominika,"A very short walk from the airport through what seemed a relatively safe area. Adam was a great host who wanted to answer any all questions and Max, the cat, made the place feel just that much better. Coming back in a little less than two weeks"
6142396,60415183,2016-01-23,41814347,Joshua,"Adam made me feel very welcome in his home(so did Max, the cat). The place was clean, comfy, and close to the airport."
6142396,60614326,2016-01-25,53456966,Dominika,Another great stay. Max (the cat) was even friendlier than usual and snuggled with me throughout the morning. Adam accommodated an early check in (10 am) although he wasn't around. Would stay again anytime.
6142396,61791524,2016-02-08,28212102,Sijia,"Adam is an extremely nice host! He picked me up at the train station and walked with me to his place even though it was cold out there. His place is comfortable and clean. The bed is big enough for two and I shared it with the cuties cat Max haha! Max is very polite and quiet, never causing troubles. I really enjoyed my time with Adam and Max. By the way, it takes about 15 minutes to walk to the rental car station. It's not difficult to find, just ask Adam to for directions. I'm sure he will be glad to help! This place is highly recommended!"
6142396,66376085,2016-03-22,2939058,Brian,My stay at Adam's place was what I needed for my time in Boston. Adam is a great host and was helpful with any questions I had. I highly recommend. *having Max the cat around was a nice bonus
6142396,66890376,2016-03-25,22494010,Karen,Adam was a very accommodating host! He was very helpful and gave me directions to the nearest train station. His place was clean and very cozy.
Overall,"I had a very pleasant experience.\"",,,,
6142396,68432031,2016-04-04,51915629,Keyan,"Adam was a very friendly and accommodating host. The place was also very cozy and conveniently located. It was a pleasure to stay here. Also, Adam's cat, Max, was one of the friendliest cats I've ever seen! Huge bonus if you love cats."
6142396,68778614,2016-04-06,15214756,Justin,"Before I booked Adam's place, I read lots of wonderful comments left for him, it turned out my own experience was another proof of how nice he and his place were."
I very much enjoyed staying at his place and playing with his cat Max. Adam was extremely helpful and friendly,we talked pretty much stuff of each other's professional life too.,,,,
And Adam did a big favor to me by booking Uber for me at 03:30 in the morning,"I am so grateful to all his help.\"",,,,
6142396,69492924,2016-04-11,48254325,Aridane,"Is a great place to stay in Boston, 20 minutes walking from/to the airport and few minutes from the subway. More than recommend"
6142396,70448732,2016-04-17,63429500,Katie,"Adam was a wonderful host and super helpful.  The customer service was great!  He was very good in explaining how to get places.  The apartment is clean and very close to public transportation, which made things very convenient."

6142396,71793280,2016-04-28,63158555,Frank,Adam was quick to answer the phone as soon as I landed and gave precise directions to get to his location.  The neighborhood was quiet and plenty safe to walk around.  His apartment had everything necessary for a comfortable night's rest.  Thanks!
6142396,72536594,2016-05-03,31362011,Mark,Adam's place was indeed perfect for my fleeting visit to Boston before my onward flight!  I would gladly stay there again if I needed somewhere as an overnight stop.  Adam was helpful and easy to get hold of with answers to any questions I had before my arrival.
You really are sleeping in the main living space of Adam's apartment,but at no time did I feel in the way.,,,,
Adam had plenty of advice for restaurants,etc and I have to say that the Italian that is about a block away was amazing!,,,,
Finally,"the bed was very comfortable!\"",,,,
6142396,73006368,2016-05-06,62586316,Sharif,Perfect place to stay for quick layover and catch flights. He is very helpful. Check in and out was easy!
6142396,73217309,2016-05-07,2083561,Alessio,Adam was great! He's really a nice person and he he prepared and took care of everything I needed. The location is particularly amazing if you need to g to the airport (really 10 minutes walking from the car rental!).
"\"",,,,,
6142396,74149160,2016-05-13,65309335,Michael,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6142396,74573650,2016-05-15,4129875,Vanessa,"Adam was great; he made me feel very welcome. He carried my (oversized) suitcase up the stairs when I arrived, and he also carried it down the stairs when I left. I felt very grateful for this! He also asked if I needed anything at the grocery store when he went out, to which I replied that I would love some Fuji apples. Adam then returned with a bag of 12 Fuji apples...which basically single-handedly made my stay rock. (I realise that not everyone might not be obsessed with Fuji apples as much as I am...but still!) He also - upon realising that he didn't have any clean towels - rushed out to buy new ones."
So - I would say that the best part of this listing is the host (so warm) and the great price.,,,,,
Also: the flat is located only a couple of blocks from a T Station,so it was really easy - and quick - to get downtown.,,,,
"All good here! \"",,,,,
6142396,75035427,2016-05-18,44049699,Peggie,"Close to the airport in East Boston. The room had everything I needed. Adam was very helpful, from sending an email a couple of hours before the arrival time to make sure I knew how to find the room, to looking up phone numbers for me. The apartment is in an older neighborhood and had a throwback feel to it."
6142396,75174612,2016-05-19,14357755,Mary,This was the perfect place for a quick layover in town. Adam was super helpful and communicative and a very nice host! The bed is really comfy and the kitty was too cute! Definitely recommend!

Adam is awesome there to help you with anything you need to make your stay comfortable. It's a great location and very close to the airport and downtown. I would definitely stay there again, and hope others will love their stay as well"
6142396,77936125,2016-06-04,60792870,Zoe,Nice comfy bed close to the airport! Worked perfectly for my really early flight.
6142396,78476563,2016-06-06,28527752,Monica,We got in late and Adam was very flexible with us. The bed was very comfortable and his place was clean. Best place to stay if wanting to be close to the airport. It was a ten minute walk from the car rental!
6142396,78638924,2016-06-08,54891348,Malcolm,"Thank you so Adam for hosting me before my international flight! It was in a very convenient location to the airport, everything was spotless, and the bed was very comfortable!"
6142396,79077742,2016-06-11,71585596,Jack,Adam is a good host. The place is exactly as stated.  A good place to crash for layover.  Bed is in the living  room and is pretty comfortable. Cat is sweet.  It is a small apartment but was just what I needed.  Probably to small for a couple but singles will like it.  Adam was very gracious especially this being my first Airbnb.
6142396,79252052,2016-06-12,51012167,Nate,Adam was very helpful. Considering it was a shared apartment I barely knew he was there. The listing is accurate and the location is perfect for a Boston layover.
6142396,79352874,2016-06-12,69964403,Noah,"Adam is a great host and I felt totally comfortable in his home. It truly is perfect for a layover since it's so close to the airport, and Adam helped me with whatever I needed. Thanks Adam!"
6142396,79792680,2016-06-14,21506888,Jesus,Adam was a great host! I had a comfortable bed in the living room and slept really well during my layover at Boston. Taxi from airport was pretty cheap at $13 and there is a hispanic (Salvadorian?) food joint right down the block.

6142396,80490617,2016-06-18,46679169,Susanne,"Adam made me feel welcome from the beginning. He waited for me and the communication was perfect to find his place. His flat is clean and her prepared a lot of things to make me feel comfy and home. If I need a layover near the Boston airport again, I would definitely come back!"
6142396,81230100,2016-06-21,21825366,Kendra,"Adams place is a great location for a quick Boston stop. Super close the airport! Adam was a great host, made sure I was at home and comfortable. Max the cat is also very friendly!"
6142396,81697282,2016-06-24,26382785,Ryan,Very comfy and convenient spot. Perfect for layovers from the airport.
6142396,82606230,2016-06-28,20052633,Ann,He was a very accommodating host who was willing to stay up later even though my flight was delayed and I got in pretty late. It was a very convenient location from the airport for my short layover- only about $10 in an Uber. I would stay here again if the situation arose.
6142396,84290221,2016-07-06,72650934,Wenzheng,Adam is very nice as I changed my schedule several times but he was always helpful and ready to greet me. The place is close to the airport and all facilities arr complete. Adam prepares many things for me.

6142396,86466154,2016-07-16,43087727,Long,"It is good place for layover. The place is easy to find and close to airport. The host replied the massage very soon. Anyway, it is define a good choice."
6142396,87794487,2016-07-21,38043048,Henry,"I really enjoyed my stay at Adam's place.  Adam had to work during the time of my arrival, but we communicated and he left a lock box out in the front for me to have easy access to the keys to his apt.  I was there less than 24 hours and did not see Adam due to my busy schedule.  I only left my luggage and slept there.  Adam had the place clean and it was a smooth and enjoyable experience.  The location was amazing.  Really close to everything with the Maverick Subway stop so close.  I was able to get wherever I wanted to go very easily, from downtown, freedom trail, to Fenway Park.  I would definitely recommend Adam's place if you plan on being out most of the time and just need a place to leave your luggage and to sleep.  Thank you, Adam for everything.  I will definitely look for your listing the next time I visit Boston."
6142396,87943900,2016-07-22,38194709,Stephanie,"Adam is above and beyond in communication. He is very helpful in providing information on the Boston area, including transit and attractions. Thanks Adam for the hospitality!"

6142396,92132252,2016-08-07,22952579,Marta,This was the perfect layover stop. Close to the airport and close to some great food. The host was super friendly and the cat was the cutest. Ideal!
6142396,92679712,2016-08-09,71910403,David,Perfect Place to sleep if you just need a place to crash! Max is awesome!
6142396,94015229,2016-08-14,46037058,Aletha,Adam's place was perfect for my stay in Boston! You can walk from the rental car place to his place. I opted to take an Uber and it cost me $13. His place is just a couple blocks from the subway station. Very quick and convenient to get to downtown! I stayed for 3 nights. On the second and third day I walked to the airport rental car place and rented a car. Parking in Adam's area was a breeze. Regardless of what time I came back I was able to find parking on the street.
Adam was an awesome host! He answered every question I had before and after my arrival. He was great at giving directions and made it easy for me to find my way around. The bed was very comfy and Max (the cat) is a great co-host. There are plenty of small stores and places to eat within walking distance from the house. I would highly recommend staying there for not only a layover,but a long stay as well. It was the perfect location for going into downtown,"driving up the coast and just  2 1/2 hrs from Tanglewood. It really is a perfect place - especially if you just need a place to sleep and plan to be out and about a lot. \"",,,
6142396,94701523,2016-08-16,4120288,Paul,"\"Adam was very clear in the letting me know about how to get into his apartment.  I had no problem finding him.  He was at work when I arrived but the key was in a locked box and he gave me the code to get the key.  The space is basic and perfect for someone who does not require anything fancy. It's great for someone who needs to be near Logan airport.  The neighborhood is not fancy, but there was a good place for breakfast just 3 blocks away and also an Italian place that was on \"\" DIners"

1112067,4619072,2013-05-15,5396803,Gemma,"There was a confusion over the area where the house is, it is in Dorchester area and not central Boston. We shared the bathroom with a student in the house. The bathroom and toilet were clean, but the rest of the house needs more attention cleaning wise, also the carpet in the room. The caretaker was a very friendly man and showed us were the Subway was, about 2,5 blocks from the house: T-red line straight to the South Station. This is handy for travellers that need a Bus, Train or arrive from the. Airport. And if you come in a car there is a possibility to park."

1112067,4667593,2013-05-19,4200376,Leon,"Our stay with Steve was great. He was very helpful and welcoming and so was his uncle, the main tenant of the house. The house is spacious and the beds are great, and everything you need is there. All main sites of the city are easy to access via metro, which is 2 mins walking distance from the house. Thank you Steve for a great couple of days!"
1112067,4761945,2013-05-24,6170865,Connie,"I was in town for a nursing conference located at the Boston Convention center on Summer Street.  all hotels were $250+ and therefore I looked into booking on Airbnb for the first time.  Steve has a wonderful property that is just a SUPER short walk (2min) to the Red line subway station and in no time I was in downtown Boston proper.  He and his wife were wonderful.  He was kind enough to pick me up at the airport and even took me to the airport for my early 5am flight back to San Francisco.  Steve was so very accommodating and even took me on a little tour.  Everything in and around Boston is very close and connected by the T subway system, so you really don't need to pay the high expense in staying in Boston Proper.  If you are looking for an affordable trip to Boston, I highly recommend that you look into staying with Steve."

Took me on a tour of the city, found a good Caribbean spot for food, and even took me to the airport to catch my 530 AM flight back to Chicago.  Definitely wouldn't have gotten that hospitality from a hotel."
The house is clean,full of charm,with kitchen,laundry,"wifi at your disposal.  15 minutes on the Red line and you are in downtown Boston.  Would definitely stay here again.  \"",

During my whole stay he was very helpful. Thank You Klio! Steve's house is not in the center of the city but very close to the subway. Only a 5 minutes walk. I need only 20 minutes to the very famous Common Park in Boston downtown. I stayed in the second floor. My (new?) Airbnb room was not really complete, but for sleeping it was good. I could use everything in the whole house: living room, kitchen and (for me very important) the laundry. Because it's an old house, it was a very special atmosphere there. I liked it! Okay, if every rooms in Steve's house are rent (4 rooms), I think the bathroom in the second floor will be to small, but it's not really a problem. During the 4 days I have spend in Boston, I saw Steve only two times for a view minutes. He was very friendly and helpful. If I'll visit Boston a second time, I would like to stay in Steve's house again. (Sorry my English, I'm German, it's not my language!)"
1112067,5329949,2013-06-24,6393567,Magdalena,Steve was a great host. He was really helpful and very responsive to my messages and queries. The place is big and we had it all to ourselves. The house is old and charming but very well kept. The bathroom is recently renewed and very nice.
"The location is a bit south of the main downtown area. It's easily accessible by train or a 10 minute cab ride. It's a suburban area so if you don't mind staying a bit away from walking distance from the main area then this is a great place for the price. I'd recommend it.\"",,,,,

En fait nous n'avons pas vu steve mais seulement une personne qui nous a accueilli pour nous remettre les clés. C'est une maison ou les 3 chambres sont louées donc un peu déçus: ce n'est pas comme ça qu'on le voyait.

1112067,6555259,2013-08-17,6289388,Sophie & David,We had a really great time at Steve place!
The place is well located (few minutes walk from the train station) and in 15 minutes you're in the city center. The bedroom was nice and really clean,king size bed and AC. The bathroom was also clean.,,,,

1112067,7012367,2013-09-03,7221547,John,Steve was a great host and his place was better than advertised.  So close to the subway.  I had a great time and would recommend it to others staying in the Boston Area.

The area was o.k., our room as well as the shared rooms -bathroom, kitchen- were o.k. as well. This means overall clean and big enough. We had nicer rooms for this price, but as Boston is very pricy we would recommend steve's and stay there again. Espec.thanks for your friendliness steve!"

The house was in a quiet residential area with good access to the T. When I returned to the house in the evening, Steve and all of the guests were gathered and we had a terrific visit."
Normally,I'm not used to sharing a bathroom,but everyone was courteous and it worked.,,,

1112067,7529512,2013-09-23,5506210,Debra,"Steve was a lovely, warm host. The room was big, clean & tidy. Although Dorchester is a little out of the city centre it is a nice train trip in (only 15 minutes) highly recommend this listing."
1112067,7856740,2013-10-06,8836966,(EMAIL HIDDEN),"We were looking for a place to stay outside of Boston and this was fine for one night. When we arrived, we had expected to stay in the room posted and paid for but instead were given a different room with a double bed and one pillow. The room was clean and comfortable for a night. Steve tried to work things out and returned some of our money as we were given a different room."
There were more people staying in the house than anticipated but they all kept to themselves and were not disruptive. The bathroom could have been cleaner and it was not as easy to find parking. However,Steve later told us it was safe to park behind the house. Positives for us included its close proximity to the metro station and the maintenance man was very helpful in telling us about the Red Line and navigating around Boston.,,,,

1112067,8336388,2013-10-26,6455885,Clair,"We had a great time at Steve's place in Boston! Steve is a great host and made us feel very welcome. The house is in a lovely older building but the facilities are modern and comfortable. The area is residential, so quiet at night. As others have mentioned Steve doesn't live there but comes by each day and we enjoyed chatting to him and the other guests (I think there are 4-5 rooms total). The room was large and bright and there is a communal living room and kitchen for use. The house is in Dorchester but it was easy to get into the city - the train is only a few minutes walk away and about a 20-min trip in. There are a few decent eating options nearby (the Blarney Stone had good food) and some basic supermarkets/convenience stores within walking distance. The only downside was we weren't in Boston long enough - we'll have to come back! Thanks for a great visit Steve!"
1112067,8392061,2013-10-28,7830851,Marina,Steve's house was indeed cozy and comfortable. A short T ride to downtown Boston (15 min on the red line).
There are five rooms (two on the first floor and three on the second floor),one shared bathroom,and one shared half-bathroom / laundry room (no lock on the door). The two of us had no issue at all getting a chance to use the bathrooms - but not all guest rooms were occupied at the time. Steve doesn't live there but has a maintenance person (unfortunately we didn't get a chance to meet either of them). Steve was very kind to leave bottled water and nice notes for us - thanks!!!,,,
The only thing that didn't go smoothly was getting the keys. Steve promised they would be waiting in the mailbox,but they turned out to be inside. We were lucky that one of the residents was home and was kind to let us in.,,,,

Steve is a very nice guy, he waited us till very late when we arrived there and when we checked out he take us to see half of boston, and guys in the house “Khalil”are really good, chatting with us, giving nice food to us and took us to buy prepaid SIMs. And the red line is just ten minute away from Steve's, which is easy to access to the downtown of Boston. Just one little disadvantage is that we need to do shower upstairs. The cleanness is good normal people, but if you for your friend has an allergic/sensitive to dust you need a masker to overcome it.  Overall still good for us."

1112067,14164888,2014-06-13,8968450,Shivangi,"Nice spot for a 3 day trip to boston. It's not in the heart of the city but the red line from the city/station gets you here in just about 20mins. It is also the same line that takes you directly to Harvard and MIT. The neighborhood has a few shops and earrings options but we spent most of our time in the city, returning only to crash. The room we had wasn't the one shown in the pictures. Steve has another property just behind the one listed and he accommodated us there. It was almost the same in terms of amenities - basic but clean and comfortable. We shared one bathroom with three other rooms but didn't have much of an issue there. Steve is a friendly guy, very prompt in his responses to questions."

We met some interesting people and overall had a great experience.

L'hôte était absent mais quelqu'un de très accueillant nous attendait à la maison pour nous rendre les clés,faire le tour du propriétaire,et nous montrer l’accès au métro.,,,
La propreté de la maison est juste correcte,probablement lié à la rotation des visiteurs.,,,,

The buildings and surroundings have history but it is definitely a neighborhood that is growing.  Lots of wonderful  Vietnamese food and friendly people willing to give directions, etc."
Steve was quick to answer emails and texts and offered laundry,etc. when we met. The property manager Khalil was helpful with information and a quick tour of the neighborhood.,,,,
The room was fine-queen bed,wifi,shared bathroom and kitchen down the hall.  The one caveat is that while the listing stated that the room was in the house,we were actually in an annex apartment building across the street.  It was fine,the facilities were what we needed-a bed,bathroom

Warm & Cozy/Steve was accommodating and made us feel welcome immediately. Despite the mix-up,he made arrangements for us to stay with another host,refunding the first night's stay. He met us at the farmhouse above although we got in late and then at his place the next morning.,,,
The space is basically as advertised. Note,this is not where Steve and his family live; there are multiple others renting rooms in the house (each room locks separately). The house is reasonably clean,likely due to the multiple renters.,,,
The house is ~5min walk from Fields Corner T station (red line). Never felt unsafe,even walking back from the T late at night (was never alone). It's a great place to stay given the location. You can be in center city Boston in no time for a fraction of the cost.,,,,
Parking is available on the street or in the back.,,,,,

We stayed in the upstairs room with the original, refinished pine floors.  The room was large and the bed was firm and comfortable.  The shared bathroom was clean, fully functional, easily accessible and maintained daily.  Being so close to the Boston rail system made the location very convenient to access all of Boston quickly."
In summary,the people we met were fun to be with,very cooperative in helping us in our tours and eager to make our visit memorable.  If you use the house for a staging area for Boston festivities,you will be very pleased.  If you are expecting the Marriott uptown,"your expectations may not be met.  \"",

The room is clean and pictures you see in the Airbnb is the same as you live in the house. It's quite convenient to have access to kitchen and refrigerator. you're free to use utensils and cook in the kitchen. It let you feel at home. I and my wife had a good stay in Steve's house. If we have chance to visit Boston again, we will come back here again. By the way, the neighborhood is very safe. It also only take 5 mins to walk to subway station. It's extremely convenient."

My friend and I had originally only reserved a room for Saturday night, and we were planning to stay somewhere else Friday night. Our other place to stay fell through, so at the last minute I asked Steve if we could come a night early, and he said we were in luck and they had a room open. When we met him, he was very friendly, kind, and professional."
The room was clean and comfortable. There were other renters in the house and two bathrooms shared with those other renters. The bathroom had a basket full of extra toiletries if needed. They also let us put things in the refrigerator in the shared kitchen.,,,,,
The neighborhood felt a bit shady,but that was not any fault of the host. I just had not done my research on areas of Boston. It was in Dorchester. Steve,the host gets a 6 star rating out of 5 in my book (out of 5 stars. He went above and beyond). I was not aware about Dorchester,so you might want to research cities before going to them. There was a McDonald's within walking distance if you like fast food. There were also other convenient stores. If you're a foodie,it's best to catch the subway into the city and eat in other parts of Boston. Also on the plus side,the room was located very close--within walking distance--to a subway station

It is a shared house with other guests, but we were out most of the day and didn't have much interaction with them. Steve wasn't there when we arrived, but he left us clear instructions to gain access to the house and the room. We later met him and he was very kind and wanted to make sure we had a great stay. The room was warm and no A/C, but there were 2 fans in the room to help. We parked in the back and messaged Steve to confirm this was ok, and he got back to us really quickly (saying that it was fine!).  About a 8 minute walk to the subway station. The neighborhood was a little shady, but we never felt unsafe. Just noticed the room we had was not one of the photos, but it was nice."
1112067,38679246,2015-07-17,2147937,Kathryn,The room was comfortable and quiet in a busy city neighborhood.  Steve was extremely friendly and worked to make my stay enjoyable.  Other guests were also staying and we had interesting though brief conversations.  I took an nice walk to Ronan Park where I could see beautiful views of the bay.
1112067,39289399,2015-07-22,34227995,Jean,Steve foi super receptivo. Fez um tour conosco em seu carro e nos mostrou o bairro além de nos levar ao supermercado. O quarto era limpo e confortável e a cozinha equipada. A região nos inspirou um pouco de medo à noite mas não aconteceu nada e Steve disse que era seguro. Recomendo a todos. Obrigado  Steve pela receptividade e atenção.

He showed us the community around the house by the day we arrived. The house has everything you need, everything!!!! JUST bring yourself in..."
1112067,40333110,2015-07-30,22200076,Benoit Henri,Très bon séjour. La maison était propre et le quartier très sympa. Proche du centre ville (5 min à pieds pour aller au métro et 20 min pour arriver en centre ville sans correspondance). Supermarché à proximité. Si nous revenons sur Boston nous reviendrons ici!
"Very pleasant stay. The house was clean and nice neighborhood. Close to downtown. 5 min to the train station et 20 min with the subway without connection. Grocery store close by. If we come back to Boston we will come back for sure.\"",,,,,
1112067,40777696,2015-08-02,36989908,Boi-Hoa,"I personally recommend Steve's place for anyone wants to explore Boston. It's very quiet, safe and convenient, just a few blocks walking distance to redline subway. I would stay here again next time I visit Boston. Thanks. Hoa"
1112067,41044715,2015-08-03,38793106,Jorge,"Friendly host. Large, comfortable room. Sketchy neighborhood. Because of neighborhood and distance to Boston can't recommend."
1112067,41634973,2015-08-08,37229977,Julie,"Steve était un hôte parfait! A notre arrivée, on a été accueilli par un étudiant qui vit dans sa maison et tous c'est bien passé. L'organisation était facile car Steve répond généralement très vite aux messages sur le site (dans l'heure). On a rencontré Steve le lendemain matin, il est très accueillant et il nous a donné plein de brochures d'information à propos de la ville."
La chambre était comme décrite,spacieuse avec un grand lit double. On avait accès à une cuisine,une salle de bains et un lave-linge. Le confort y était,on a bien dormi,il n'y a pas trop de bruit dans le quartier et il y a de l'airco. Le seule petit bémol est que le matelas est recouvert d'un plastic.,
La maison est située à 5 minutes à pied d'une ligne de métro qui mène au centre ville ou à Harvard.,,,,,
En général,nous avons passé un agréable séjour chez Steve et nous le recommandons!,,,,

1112067,42526810,2015-08-14,29426559,Christine,Steve was a good start for our trip trough the US. A warm and friendly welcome.
1112067,42872497,2015-08-16,36168258,Yves,Very good place to stay. Around 5 mins walking to the subway station and 15 mins to downtown. The neighborhood is fine and there is no problem to return to Steve's house late at night. The house is very clean and the room has air conditioning and a fan on the roof. Steve is very kind and friendly. He kept our luggage before check-in and after check-out time. I definitely recommend this place.
1112067,43777022,2015-08-22,36457667,Angela,"It was nice to stay at warm and Cozy. The check-in times are flexible. We arrived rather late, which was no problem. Other guests arrived 1 night earlier (due to plane issues) and were hosted in the living room for that night. This is really good if your arrival time is a bit uncertain."
The room we had was exactly as described and as on the picture.,,,,,
When we called Steve he replied instantly and was very happy to help us. We met Steve only once,but he had a friend who checked if everything was allright in the house.,,,,
The place is close to the subway station which connects you directly to the city. The neighbourhood is not the best in Boston,but that is why the price per night is relatively cheap.,,,,
Several rooms in the house are rented out,"but we never had to wait long for the bathroom.\"",,,,
1112067,44927615,2015-08-30,38271760,Matthaeus,Steve is a very nice man and the house is nice and clean.

He welcomed us nicely, gave us advices to visit the city and some useful brochures, but above all he has been so kind and helpful all the time. The house is nice and clean, other guests were also nice and quite. The location is perfect to use the metro, a few stops to downtown. Very good price for a nice stay in Boston! I would surely suggest other travelers to chose this place for their stay!"
1112067,47783041,2015-09-21,42975523,Stefan,I really enjoyed to stay at Steve's house. The house friendly and clean and the tenants from are very friendly and helpful. I will stay the next time again.
1112067,48465618,2015-09-26,26903565,Adam,"Steve was very friendly however know before you go that this place is more like a hostile rather than a typical AirBnB. Bathrooms are nice, rooms are okay, the rest of the house could use some work. Location is convenient to the train line but not in the best part of town."
1112067,48972678,2015-09-29,18295898,Chen,"It's a comfortable room, Steve provided towel and there is a huge kitchen that people can use. It's 5 mins from Red line. And there are two students living there, they are cool guys."
1112067,49532139,2015-10-04,32718623,Kelli,"I never met Steve, but we had a nice stay and he arranged for our late arrival. I will say it did feel more like a hostel experience than other Air Bnb experiences I've had (several other people stayed at the house). But the price point was great for the city, and the T was only a 10 minute walk. The room is spacious, and the bathroom is really nice!"
1112067,49887137,2015-10-07,31255720,Yu Erh,"Room is comfortable and nice, the house near subway, very convenient and safe, Steve always willing to help us, thank you very much!!!"
1112067,50491470,2015-10-12,43430495,Lidia,"La casa estaba ubicada en un barrio a 15 min del centro de Boston en metro. El metro a unos 10 minutos a pie. El barrio no nos pareció el más adecuado para pasearse a partir de ciertas horas de la noche, y aunque no tuvimos ningún problema, nos veíamos obligados a estar en la casa no más tarde de las 20h. Tampoco vimos por allí ningún supermercado, era totalmente residencial. Por la noche se oía bastante el ruido de la calle. Las habitaciones se ven mejor en las fotos de lo que realmente son. A la casa le faltaba una actualización, se veía algo vieja y un poco descuidada. El baño estaba algo sucio, aunque tenía de todo: secador de pelo, algún gel y champú, toallas… A la cocina le faltaba una mesa donde comer. En nuestra habitación concretamente no funcionaba la luz del techo, y la de la mesilla de noche no tenía interruptor, había que enchufar y desenchufar cada vez. Respecto a Steve nos pareció muy simpático y amable cuando le conocimos, aunque nos falló en el primer momento: no nos dejó las llaves donde dijo a la hora a la que habíamos quedado, y tuvimos suerte que uno de los huéspedes nos abrió, luego tuvimos que llamarle con nuestro móvil para contactar con él, eso sí, llegó 15 minutos después. Aunque no tuvimos ningún problema, no nos resultó cómodo alojarnos allí."
1112067,51080649,2015-10-17,44154687,Alan,Steve was a great host.  Very engaging and concerned with guest welfare.
1112067,51341582,2015-10-19,21047794,Sven,The house is a nice old building in a quiet neighbourhood and easy to reach by public transport. The students who live there were very friendly and very helpful! We had a  big room in which we slept excellent.  The bathroom was quite clean.
We met steve only for a couple of seconds,he seems to be a very nice guy!,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1112067,51585265,2015-10-21,40641541,Julie,"We felt very welcomed by our host who was more than generous with his time. He helped us with trip details and was inviting about the use of his home. The location was accurate - about 20 minutes from downtown Boston. The room was comfortable and clean, but the home itself was in a bit of disrepair. Still it was worth it!"
1112067,54899981,2015-11-25,41423280,Yue,"Steve is a very nice host, he is very considerate and he helped us to cook very delicious lobsters! His house located in a very convenient place, only 10 minutes' walk to subway station. I will definitely recommend Steve's place to you."

The room was very big, confortable and clean, as well as was the bathroom. Although its not near to the city center, its very close to train station (T red line) that drives directly to the main Boston attractions. I totally recommend this place and I would definitely stay there again."

1112067,73954229,2016-05-11,49058184,Rachael,"We had a lovely stay in Boston in a what we'd describe as a hostel style Airbnb. Steve really is a nice host, very friendly and welcoming. He was there taking care of the place each morning and made sure there was always bagels, cereal, milk and fruit for breakfast. The room was ass described/pictured. The free parking was handy and even though the house was busy we never had a problem with sharing the bathroom or kitchen. Walking to the T line was easy and just minutes away making it super easy to get downtown or to Harvard/MIT."
1112067,75735598,2016-05-22,7701220,Felix,The time at Steves place was just awesome!
I think he was the best AirBnB host we have had until today!,,,,,
Steve is a very funny,helpful and relaxed guy. We enjoyed every talk we had with each other.,,,,
The room was very clean and big. We had a big bed and a tv with a lot of chanels which was great for a rain day :),,,,,
The house itself was good prepared for everythink we needed. It's a shared house with AirBnB guests and student,Steve doens't live there,but he was at the house every mornging to take care we have everythink we need. Just great!,,,

The room itself was perfectly fine and has a comfy bed. The kitchen and bathroom are shared with other Airbnb guests,we didn't have a lot of interaction with them as we were mostly out to explore the city.,,,,
Although there's some nice vietnamese restaurants and shops around,the neighbourhood itself is not really worth the visit,"but the apartment is super close to the Red T line. It's about a 20 minute walk to the nearest bike sharing hub (Hubway).\"",,,

Our original checkin time was delayed due to our flight,but he made sure we were able to get in as soon as we got there. (Even if he wasn't there. He was also able to accommodate for odd hours to check in) Also,we were able to have our bags held after check out. Thankfully,we were able to go around a little more while lugging our extra bags.,,
The house is very close to the subway station (red line - fields corner) The room itself is clean,has adequate lighting. There is access to two bathrooms (which are shared). There were two towels provided as well. There were also pamphlets for places to eat and things to do,which was thoughtful.,,,
It was an awesome visit,"thank you!\"",,,,

The location is very practical if you are driving because you can leave your car there (lots of street parking) and take the subway, which is only a 5 minutes walk from the house. The subway ride is about 20 mins to downtown, depending on the amount of time you wait for the train to come. The bed was very comfortable and it was an overall good experience. I would definitely recommend staying here!"

It's just a few blocks from Boston Commons, good food in the neighborhood and an easy walk to the MBTA station.  I was in Boston for business meetings out at the Convention Center and it worked well.  I'd definitely stay here again if the travel need arose.  Adam was very communicative before arrival, and access to and information about the apartment was complete and helpful."
4546333,28357192,2015-03-22,29348268,Forest,My wife and I wanted a central location to explore the possibility of moving out to Boston - this place was perfect!  We had no idea how useful it would be to walk to the red line and it was just minutes from a variety of shops and the Boston Commons.
It was small,but not smaller than a hotel room,"and very quaint.  The place was clean and bed was unbelievably comfortable!  Everything you would need for an extended stay was here.  I got a very professional sense about the company behind this listing and I'm thankful it was available at short notice!\"",,,

Really great location - everywhere within Boston is walkable from there or a quick trip on the subway.  Really nice apartment with great facilities.  Shower was excellent and bed was comfy, if a little unsupportive on the back.  I was a bit disappointed that the apartment didn't look like the picture though - no sofa for example, which is one of the reasons I booked the apartment."

This lovely little studio was well located for us. It is within walking distance of the Charles river pathway system, the Charles/MGH T station on the Red Line and in the heart of historic Beacon Hill.  The area abounds in marvellous restaurants, quality coffee cafes and quaint shops. We had a wonderful experience; it was perfect for us."

We awoke to a great location, just on the edge of the common in beautful Beacon Hill.  The studio was comfortable and had all that we needed for a 6 night stay, but would be comfortable for longer.  There is a sofa, not sure why a previous poster suggested that there wasn't.  Emails /correspondence with Compass the company that manages the property were very clear, quick and professional.  Will stay again if we are back to Boston.  highly recommended."

The apartment is small but very cozy and provided everything we needed - especially since we planned on being out and about during our short trip to Boston."
4546333,53200864,2015-11-06,9387557,Thomas,"Adams apartment was just as advertised.  I appreciated the good communication and easy entry upon arrival.

4546333,64775353,2016-03-08,4788142,Kathryn,"We had a lovely time on Charles Street - perfect location, loads of places to eat and shops to explore. We recommend The Paramount for weekend brunch and Tatte for breakfast and coffee, both within 50m. There's also a Whole Foods within a few blocks if you want to self cater. Really easy to get everywhere in Boston, either on foot or on the T. The apartment itself was lovely, clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. Only slight complaints were that the fridge and heating were very noisy overnight. We unplugged the fridge but there was no way to control the heating."
4546333,66756189,2016-03-24,26017950,Izabel,"I was in Boston for a Conference at the Convention Center. The apartment was just like the photos, very well located.

It is a 4th floor walk up so be prepared to get a bit of a workout. Adam let us know ahead of time about the stairs which was helpful.,,,,,
The only problem I had was with the heater. It is controlled by the heater of main building so if the landlord doesn't turn on the heat you won't get any in the room. Also,"the radiator made a lot of noise and consistently woke us up.\"",,,,
4546333,70996200,2016-04-22,58001863,Kieran,Everything about the booking was really seamless. Checking in and out was really easy. The location was excellent. It's one of my favorite streets in Boston.

13667826,89700514,2016-07-29,22459062,Danielle,"I got this room for a great price for my summer residency which was a perfect walk. I think the only down fall was that it was doing one of the hottest weeks in Boston and there was no AC, so i struggle to stop sweating at night. Also there was no closet to keep me clothes for the week so i basically lived out of my suitcase. The kitchen was a little gross and same with the bathroom.  I am not too picky so i made it work for the week for the price."
thanks,,,,,

10787333,80493717,2016-06-18,77165763,Ben,"The Garden Apt was perfect for my girlfriend and I. We had no problems finding it (minus a construction detour) and parking was not an issue. The neighbourhood is quiet so we had no problems getting to sleep at night. Lots of natural light for a partially underground place and lots of privacy. The amenities were great, all the appliances worked and we didn't feel we needed anything else. TV package included was awesome! Location is convenient. 5 min from local transit but walking most places is an option too. Ziyad and his family were very helpful and welcoming, giving us good advice and information on some local spots. We felt very comfortable, welcomed and safe. We would definitely stay here again and recommend them for others travelling."
The only issue I can think of is that it is located on top of a hill so those with physical impairments might find it hard coming/going on foot.,,,,,

The prudential center was only a few blocks away. The neighborhood of brownstones were beautiful. The apartment itself was great...stove, fridge, large toaster oven, dishes were all available for use. We arrived about 4 hours before check-in and we were able to check-in early which was great. We also didn't fly out until several hours after checkout and a place was made available to store our luggage so we could continue to enjoy the city. I definitely would recommend staying here!"

Some info to know...the thermostat is controlled for each floor so if you get cold at night, bring something warm to sleep in as you don't have any direct control of the temperature.  The kitchen has some coffee and creamer for the coffee pot which was appreciated.  One suggestion would be to also have little items like salt and pepper just so whole containers don't have to be purchased for a week stay.  Overall, good stay.  Oh, it is a walk up so beware if you packed heavy :)"

I had an Interview at Tufts medical Center and the train station was 5 minutes away. The location was really beautiful right next to the Charles River and the room was very comfortable, it was nice to have the company of two adorable dogs and Onyx a cat who thought that she was also a dog. Thomas is very sophisticated and cultured, and has many historical decoration pieces around the house that he loves to share interesting information about and also showed me around Charles street.

We also walked to the Museum of Fine Art, Boston Public Library, Symphony Hall, and more. The roof deck is fantastic; if you're in Boston in the summer, you need a place with a roof deck, and the shared deck for this building has one of the best 360 views imaginable."
Thomas was a fantastic host who went above and beyond to help make our stay comfortable and give advice and recommendations re: Boston. He's clearly very invested in making sure he accommodates guests as best he can. While staying here,"you'll see Thomas and his pets often; I will say \"\"guest interaction\"\" is more than other Airbnbs I've stayed in",although for me this was welcome.,,,
The place could be a bit cleaner,and there's a distinct pet smell. As the listing says,there's no wifi. Read the whole listing,it's accurate.,,

8450098,80081567,2016-06-16,63795367,David,"Our host, Thomas was very knowledgeable and friendly. His two dogs, Sandy and Cottonball were always ready for a little loving or to play fetch with us. Thomas has a wonderful house in a very old part of Boston, and it was very cool to hear how it was built and to ride in the very well maintained vintage wrought iron elevator. The view from the roof is spectacular and was part of the reason I booked the room in the first place. Our room had a bunk bed and a single bed which was ideal for me and my two young adult children. The beds were nice and cozy after a day of exploring all over Boston. It happened that we visited at the ideal time to leave the window open for some very nice fresh air. Thomas was kind enough to take his dogs for a walk with us the first night and show us around the neighborhood, recommending places to eat. We are a hip, skip, and a jump from Charles street with plenty of local shopping, and the Boston subway, which was a great way to get around starting right at the airport. His bnb is only a couple of blocks from a subway station on the red line. TIP: get a Charley card and load it with some money for riding the subway or"
Public busses. The card is free at any subway monitors office near ticket purchasing/ card loading  machines.,,,,,
"Tom was always ready to offer us a glass of wine or beer in the evening or coffee in the morning and tell us a little bit about which famous person lived in the neighborhood. I am booking the room again as soon as Infinish the review!\"",,,,,

8450098,81137459,2016-06-21,77634902,Evelyn,My stay was perfect and memorable.
I love the neighborhood,which is safe and quiet,at the same time very convenient. Just a few minutes walk to a red line station,long fellow bridge and Charles River; a 15mins walk to North End.,,
The place was very neat and tidy. Bed and showers were comfortable. I had everything I need during my stay. I also enjoyed the beautiful view of sunset at the roof top.,,,,,
Thomas took care of every detail and tried his best to accommodate when his guests need anything. He even sent me research on weather and transportation information,which was very considerate! He also made excellent suggestions of great restaurants and places to visit. He was humorous and very knowledgeable in history,geography and languages etc.,"chatting with him was great fun. \"",,

You are within a 10-minute walk of parks for the kids, boat rentals, and the subway. It is about a 15-minute walk to the science museum.

Thomas was very kind and arrange everything in a short time to have a good time. The room is exactly the same. The good surprise are  Sandy,Marshmallow (the 2 dogs) and the wondefull roof deck at the last floor. Probably one of the most beautiful in Boston !,,,,

7211531,55876404,2015-12-06,50412149,Joelle,"Very nice and accommodating, offered us toast, cereal, bananas and hard boiled eggs! Quiet neighborhood next to Fenway park which was creepy to walk through at night. Bed too small for 2 people and not that comfortable but worked for my friend and I's budget. Wonderful comforter and pillows offered too!"
7211531,56328876,2015-12-12,49872399,Lee,"Wendy and her roomies were great hosts.  She was very helpful with directions from Logan to her place, which was located only 7 minutes walking  from the Green Line stop.  The apartment was neat, clean, and in order!"
7211531,56539228,2015-12-14,24225282,Caitlin,Wendy was a very gracious host. Even with our quick stay we felt welcome and comfortable. A great affordable option!
7211531,70779263,2016-04-20,50855036,刘,"Wendy is a great host, the room is good for single traveller. Hope to see you again!"
7211531,74938364,2016-05-17,23493905,Julia,Wendy and Jeff were great hosts. They answered all the questions we had and were always available. The room was exactly as described. It was very clean and big enough for 2 people. The only thing is that the bed was not very comfortable to sleep on. We also had access to the kitchen and living room which was great as we could cook our breakfast.
The apartment is in a great area which is safe. It's close to the Fenway subway station and close to a big supermarket 'Star market' open 24/7.,,,,,
Overall our stay in Boston was comfortable,"convenient and we would definitely stay with Wendy again!\"",,,,
7211531,75590156,2016-05-22,27337084,Tanya,"Wendy & her boyfriend are very kind to us. Her apartment is very comfortable, and the location is very convenient. Every afternoon I ran from her place to the Charley's River, just along the river bank. It's very enjoyable. Nice girl, good place. Thanks Wendy~"
7211531,77341633,2016-05-31,66387618,Rick,"Wendy and Jeff were the perfect hosts. The building, flat and room are quaint and cozy. The apartment is in an amazing location. It is across the street from a park, city gardens and nature conservancy. Around the corner is a block of great restaurants. It is walking distance (like super close) from Fenway Park, Boston Common and Cambridge. I was up early and didn't get in till late. The hosts were extremely gracious regarding my erratic hours and asked me regularly if I had everything I needed. Wendy and Jeff are extremely lovely people. I hope our paths cross again."
1248870,7808645,2013-10-04,1718295,Campbell,"This place was 5 star.  Modern, comfortable, great views over the city. Outstanding night views and close to the Northend and freedom trail. It's right next to the station so getting around is easy. Canal street has great place for breakfast across the road, liquor store close by. Can't recommend it highly enough. Richard was great to deal with.  We'd definitely stay next time we return"
1248870,8040435,2013-10-14,1305134,John,"The apartment is excellent: very modern, efficient, comfortable with a stunning view of the skyline and busy Boston. The only negative was the airconditioner that cut in an out like a small jet engine. The location is very good with the Metro underneath the building, and about 10 min walk to a wonderful Italian restaurant street."
I was surprised by the formality of the booking. I had to send a several page agreement signed by my wife and I,back to Boston from Australia with very specific details about every aspect of the booking. I thought Airbnb's standard conditions did the job. Within this agreement was the stipulation that we were forgoing a $150 fee to self clean which was spelt out in minute detail once we arrived. We were happy to do this in lieu of the large fee,but it was somewhat officious,highlighted by the underlined urging for us to leave a tip for the cleaners who prepared the room for us!,,
Overall a very good stay,"with a few niggling issues. \"",,,,
1248870,22429842,2014-11-06,8023159,Chris,"Wonderful space at a reasonable price.  I really liked that it's right next to the train station, as well as CVS Pharmacy.  Plus, the gym space is really nice, and I was able to get in a great workout each day I stayed."
1248870,22844273,2014-11-16,10412999,Manuel,"\"Richard's 1 Bedroom apartment was well furnished, immaculately clean and just as advertised.

1248870,28602628,2015-03-27,6330169,Carolina,"The apartment lives up to its description in every way possible. It was a beautiful space clean and luxurious. From the bottles of wine left by our host to the stunning views it truly felt like a home away from home. The bed was incredibly comfortable and our floor was quiet. Being on the seventh floor allowed us to hear the city but not be overwhelmed by it. The neighborhood has several restaurants and convenience stores that are easily accessible. The best part of all is that an entrance to the North Station T train is on the same block as the apartment building which made going into different parts of the city and getting back home convenient and quick. Overall a lovely stay, no complaints at all."
1248870,36665556,2015-06-30,14455629,Heather,We couldn't have asked for a better location to serve as our home base as we explored the city. Everything about our stay was easy and comfortable. We would definitely recommend it!

It was very clean and was the perfect amount of space for me and my boyfriend. There were even bottles of wine left for us from the host which was an extremely kind gesture, which we were not expecting at all! The apartment was also very conveniently located which made getting around Boston very easy for us. We also enjoyed Richard's booklet of suggestions of places to go/see/eat in Boston which was great for people like us who have never been to Boston before. I would highly recommend this apartment!!"

1248870,96126342,2016-08-21,89515521,Nicole,"THANK YOU x 1 million! Richard was the very best host! Our first time in Boston was made perfect thanks to our airbnb stay. If you are going to Boston...STAY HERE! The location is PERFECT. We walked everywhere and used the T stop located right under the building. There are many bars and food places within walking distance including a CVS, 7-11 and liquor store. A short walk away from the historic North End and many other famous spots in Boston. Also, only a 9-minute uber ride from the airport. The apartment was clean and spacious. I wish we were able to spend more time in it!"
1248870,97599274,2016-08-28,80926570,Marilyn,"Location, location, location. You could get anywhere in Boston right off the elevator and onto the T. Then come back to this lovely apartment and relax. The welcome surprise was a nice touch too! Will be staying here again next time in Boston."

The room is spacious, comfortable, clean, and quiet, all perfect elements for a pleasant stay. Although she was not in town in this occasion, she made everything possible to make me feel home all the time. She's a very attentive host. I would stay here again without any doubts. Thanks Olja!"
9218312,59108647,2016-01-06,824561,Edie,"I arrived at 9:00 pm and Jone was there to let me in.  Everything was as posted; the room was spacious and clean and the bathroom was wonderful. In the morning Jone brought up coffee and muffins and was so warm and friendly, telling me about places for dinner, the arboretum down just down the road, and how to get to the commuter train. I will definitely stay here again as I come up to Boston often for work."
9218312,59620870,2016-01-12,33943313,Teresa,"A wonderful place to stay -- beautiful, comfortable, friendly -- perfect!  Everything exactly as described in listing.  The bedroom and bathroom are spacious and gorgeous -- spotlessly clean -- lovely furnishings -- in a beautifully maintained Victorian house.  Bed very comfortable -- also a nice armchair, and a window-seat.  The bathroom is really luxurious -- and not shared (very nice!).  A quiet and leafy Boston neighbourhood -- ample street parking -- and easy walking distance to the Arnold Arboretum, Roslindale center, and commuter rail.  Jone was extremely easy to work with -- very welcoming, friendly, and flexible -- and also respectful of my privacy/independence.  Separate entrance was nice, too.  This is one of the nicest places I've ever stayed -- truly lovely."

9218312,61715125,2016-02-07,53748955,Naima,I had such an amazing time at Jone's Airbnb! Jone and her husband were delightful. They accommodated my every need without my needing to ask. Jone was very good about letting me have my space but making herself available for me should I need anything. She even made me breakfast one morning because she was home and had the time! I highly recommend this Airbnb room and plan to stay there again.
9218312,62466236,2016-02-14,58226369,Andrea,Jone and her husband have a beautiful home and they were both very welcoming hosts. House is in a friendly neighborhood and they live in close proximity to a park. The bathroom is beautiful; I couldn't help but feel spoiled and pampered. Next time I hope to catch the coffee and muffins!
9218312,63238030,2016-02-21,41249278,Sandi,"Jone was so warm and welcoming. Everything is as posted-sunny, clean and cozy bedroom with a dream bathroom worth coming back for. Jone provides fresh towels and we loved her homemade blueberry muffins and morning coffee. The area felt safe and if we had more time I would have loved to explore the Arnold arboretum a short walk from Jone's place. Jone was a great host who has put a lot of love and care in her home and her surrounding community. Would definitely come back."
9218312,63860157,2016-02-27,53748955,Naima,"Very pleasant experience. As it was during my precious stay, Jone was very accommodating. Very comfortable place to stay with privacy and in a beautiful neighborhood."

Jone and her family are maintaining it beautifully and give you a little tour if you're interested - we were. Just beautiful!  Located on a quiet street and very close to Boston medical area. Free parking on street."
Jone was the perfect hostess,showed uscaroundctye house,made us feel welcome and was very easy to get hold of when needed.  Room was clean,spacious with a very comfortable. Bath newly remodeled with a glass shower with teak floor,marble tiles and heated floor. Even had a working claw foot tub although we didn't use it.,
I've found a new home in Boston and will always check for availabity here first whenever we need to be in the city.  Thank you Jone,"for your kind warm hospitality.\"",,,,
9218312,71711212,2016-04-27,46062743,David,The location - Roslindale is a really nice area.  There are a good number of restaurants (for dinner and lunch) and a few stores that sell everything you're likely to need day to day.  It took me about 35 minutes to get to downtown boston every day including a very nice walk through the arboretum.  If you don't fancy the walk the commuter rail is 5 mins away but the train fare is more expensive.  The nearest T-stop is on the orange line which has frequent trains and connects to every other line in boston.  For ease of travel it was amazing and cheap!
The room - absolutely amazing.  My attempts to steal the bathtub were unsuccessful though.  The bed is very comfy and the room is bright and airy.  There is good control over the heating of the room so it was never too hot or cold.  The room/bathroom are sort of sequestered away at the end of the 2nd (1st floor to other English people) floor hallway with a frosted glass door dividing you from the main house so you get really good privacy.,,,,,
The hosts - Dave and Jone are quite simply the kindest and most welcoming people i have ever met.  I would have no reservations about recommending them to other Airbnb-ers.,,,,,
Airport transport - Dave and Jone very kindly picked me up from the airport as my flight came in late and there was quite a bit of snow.  However,"my return journey to Logan took only 40 minutes and cost $30 on Uber.\"",,,,
9218312,72222070,2016-05-01,59382833,Angela,"Absolutely amazing! Jone met us when we first arrived, very welcoming and informative. The house is absolutely amazing and very quiet. Adorable community with great eateries. If we are ever in Boston again we will be staying at this property."
9218312,74931314,2016-05-17,16008176,Christy,"We could not have asked for a more wonderful place to stay while exploring Boston! The bathroom is quite possibly the most pleasant one we have ever had the pleasure of using. The room was beautifully decorated, incredible maple floors, and large windows that flooded the room with light. I should note that if you are a tall person, the bed is a little on the small side. Even though Jone was away during our stay, her husband, Dave, took incredibly good care of us. In the future when we return to Boston, there is no other place we would like to stay!"
9218312,75864976,2016-05-23,27754414,Simon,"This has been a perfect place to stay while visiting Boston.  A couple steps from the T and a few minutes walk from the Arborium.  A short Uber ride to Fenway Park, awesome location.  Would go there again!  Jone is a perfect host!"

The house is like described - lovely with a lot of space and an extra entrance for airbnb-guests. The room is spacious and bright with a comfortable bed. The bathroom is all new and really luxury - with bathtub and shower. Both rooms - bedroom and bathroom are located on the first floor and like an apartment just for your own. The T-Line (Roslindale Village) is just 5 minutes walk, but we did not use it - we took one of the many buses that go to Forest Hills and then it takes about 15 to 20 min to get downtown Boston. Getting around was super easy and we had no hurry. There are also some restaurants near the house - Jone had collected some menus - thank you for that! We also were allowed to park our rental car in front of the house. Everything was perfect - we definitly will stay at Jones' house again some day."

The bedroom and bathroom are in a private area of the house with a private entrance, which was perfect for coming and going as we pleased, which is what we were looking for. The bathroom was a joy to use. Easy short walk to Roslindale with nice restaurants and bakeries. We were able to nip down to get coffee first thing in the morning before having breakfast back in the room. And downtown Boston was only about 15mins away! The proximity to the arboretum was an unexpected surprise. We would definitely consider staying with Jone again."

9218312,90321922,2016-07-31,75656435,Jessica,"Jone was a great host! Her house is beautiful and easily accessible by public transport (use the orange line and bus, not the commuter rail). The bed and pillows were more comfortable than my own (and that's saying something), and the coverlet was nice and light for summer. The only drawback for some people may be that she does not have air conditionong. I was here for the hottest day of the year, and I didn't have any issues - open windows and a desk fan were sufficient to keep things cool. Jone is a great conversationalist, and was genuinely interested in sharing and learning more about me. I've never seen snow and have fallen in love with Boston - I plan to come back as soon as I can, and will hope to stay with her again."

Their accommodation was beautifully presented and very comfortable. There was a collection of interesting books on the locality for us to read and practical things such as timetables for us to use.

Only complaint is due to it being right next to the subway, noise from the train is a bit of an issue. Luckily had earplugs so it wasn't too much of an issue. Rex was very accommodating and worked with us when we accidentally booked a room with one bed and let us use a second room altogether. Very friendly and very prompt with service.

6574771,71896731,2016-04-29,66810822,Tracey,I was in the area for work and it was great. I pretty much had the floor to myself and it was super quiet and lovely.
6574771,74134520,2016-05-13,3078181,Selma,"Staying in one of Isa's rooms was really great! It is nicely located in a quiet neighbourhood and only about 20 mins by walking distance to the beach and about 10 mins to a huge grocery store, with small restaurants and corner shops near by. The house itself and the rented room is beautifully decorated and has everything you need. Also booking/renting the room and moving in worked pretty well and without any difficulty, as Isa is a great host too. I would recommend it to anyone as long as it is still availabe! This place really deserves 5 stars!"
6574771,75700702,2016-05-22,16697745,Gary,Good location and comfy room. Isa is a great host! I enjoyed my stay there :)
6574771,79139594,2016-06-11,9665629,Angela,"Exactly what I was looking for.  A very cozy and comfortable room in a peaceful neighborhood. Isa is very sweet and polite. Also, the roof deck is a plus. I will be back again!"
6574771,80022865,2016-06-15,3878964,Elena,"Isa's apartment was exactly as described and had everything I needed for my short stay there. It is located conveniently close to the beach (15 min walking) and to two T-stations. Even though I did not meet Isa, she was always easily reached via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) or Airbnb and checked regularly if everything was okay or if I needed anything. She is a great host who takes care of her guests! I would recommend staying with her."
6574771,81778477,2016-06-25,67419555,Bat-Erdene,Isa was a well experienced host. She tried her best to make sure everything is fine with me. I felt comfortable in her place.
6574771,82663557,2016-06-28,71485167,Annie,Excellent stay. The neighborhood was quiet and the home very clean and easy to get to and from. Isa is a wonderful and welcoming host
6574771,83587151,2016-07-03,69378977,Sarah,Isa was a very sweet host. She had water and a candy on my pillow ready for me when I came home from a long day of meetings. She had her keys waiting for me when I arrived too. I had a great time!
6574771,84877981,2016-07-09,9665629,Angela,"Second time at Isa place. I came back because Enjoyed the quietness, and privacy. Also, suiting in the deck in the summer is very nice and peaceful. Thank you Isa."
6574771,86399622,2016-07-16,71746372,Jay,"I really enjoyed my stay in Isa's place. It was comfortable and clean, similar to hostel pricing, but private as well. I didn't spend so much time in the house as I was at a conference, but I did get a chance to spend some time with Isa and another guest. Isa gave great notes about the buildings/landmarks and she really knows about Boston. I was actually rather tired during that excursion, but she was easy to talk to, and I don't regret going out instead of staying in. She is polite and helpful as well, checking in via text and in person to make sure I was having a good stay. A great host, and I wish her the best."
6574771,87334032,2016-07-19,33684396,Logan,I went during the warmer season & the room got extremely stuffy. Aside from that it was a fine room.
6574771,87910712,2016-07-22,63361224,Daniel,Friendly host.  Clean comfortable room.  Lovely deck to sit on in the evening.  Easy access to public transit or bikeshare. great value!
6574771,88977536,2016-07-26,73120814,Anthony,"Isa was accommodating to my needs. Check in wasn't until 7 PM but she allowed me to check in earlier as the prior guest left early. Room was clean when I arrived with a fresh water in fridge and candy bar on my pillow. Those little things go a long way. I was there during the hot season so the room got pretty warm without AC; however, there is a fan in there to help a little bit. Communication was great. I never got to meet Isa but she stayed in constant contact with me on and  was very responsive to my messages. The only thing I would say that was an opportunity area was that I didn't have a bath towel for the first day; however, it may be due to me rushing her to get in early. The shower could use a little more pressure but it does the job. Stairs are very creaky so if you're coming in after quiet time (10 PM), it's hard to be discreet without bothering other guests. Overall, a great deal for what you get. I was satisfied with my stay there."
6574771,90987885,2016-08-03,301760,Gene,Isa provided everything mentioned and I had a lovely stay in this cosy room which had a window overlooking the roof deck. It was a very convenient location being near the airport.
6574771,91714740,2016-08-06,905455,Alicia,"Isa was very kind and communicative. The house was in a very quaint neighborhood, and the room is exactly as described."

11717217,74900427,2016-05-17,7889549,Yusra,"Although the apartment is located in a good spot, the room is a bit dirty. The host claimed that the bedsheets were clean but had some blood stains on them. Also the bathroom is not in the best condition. Would not recommend this place unless on a tight budget."

11717217,76067723,2016-05-24,52069269,Eric,"Since the host was back to China, the room was not ready when I checked in. The room is not clean, there is dust on the table. The bed sheets was not changed and I just found a small blanket. Though the host is not there, I think she is better having some people to take care of the room."
7008455,42549203,2015-08-14,37436633,Audrey,"Veronica nous a accueilli chaleureusement, elle s'est présentée à l'heure prévue à notre point de rencontre. L'appartement était propre et comme sur les photos. Elle nous a suggéré des noms de restaurants et a répondu à plusieurs de nos questions. Nous avons eu une agréable première expérience avec airbnb."
7008455,43295841,2015-08-18,341237,Kathy,"Veronica was very accommodating in arranging for me to check in on my timeline, which was fantastic. The place was clean and comfortable, and the bonus was that there were drawers and closet space, which gave me the liberty to stretch out and made the place feel like a home base for my visit to Boston. The location is fantastic, btw."
7008455,45260883,2015-09-01,36570338,Janell,"Veronica was absolutely amazing!  We had never been to the area and she took her time sharing useful apps and locations and was available to answer questions.  This location is conveniently located with the bus and the train stops right outside the front door.  There are tons of stores and restaurants in walking distance or a short ride away.  The room was perfect and she made sure there was a coffee pot, towels and toiletries available.  I would absolutely recommend this space. It was both convenient and comfortable. The neighborhood was very quiet and welcoming."

Once I got there, I was able to park very close and had plenty of space for my things. His roommates were very friendly and I enjoyed my stay."

9407895,93491580,2016-08-13,74049492,Matt,"Shreyas was accommodating in the check in process, though I never met him in person. His roommates were awesome people....very kind and friendly. I had stumbled upon a better and free alternative to stay for most nights, so I didn't spend much time at the apartment. The washing machine was broken and the house and bedroom smelled... the odor was strong enough to make all my clothing smell."
If you need a place to stay for a couple nights in Boston,I highly recommend. If you are staying more than a few days,you should seek accommodations elsewhere,"depending on your comfort level. \"",,

72811,197981,2011-03-13,423080,Yang,"Bill and Baifeng are really great hosts!!! They offered us useful suggestions about how to travel around Boston and provided us a lot of helpful stuffs such as maps and towels. Besides, their area is also very great that it is convenient for the travellers to go everywhere in Boston. The restaurants near their house are also very nice. Hope we can go to Boston again and live in Bill and Baifeng's house again!"
72811,201766,2011-03-17,429810,Shahid,"Bill and Baifeng were very gracious hosts, accommodating and friendly. Their place is conveniently located - walking distance to Harvard and a 10 minute walk to the T, or a short walk to the bus stop. I recommend them and their room."
72811,214768,2011-04-01,426189,Jorge,"Although I did not have a chance to meet my hosts, everithing went allright. They have everything setteld down to get in the house even if you have a late arrival. The room is very clean and they have internet avaliable."
I did meet on of their son's who even helped me to call a cab to leave theri house. It took me around 30 minutes to get to harvard by walk so is not that short distance but i think there is public transportarion that I could't find.,,,,,
"Jorge\"",,,,,
72811,234976,2011-04-22,406959,Rosie,"10/10.  Beautiful family, lovely home, and very close to Harvard and central Cambridge. You can either take a bus into Harvard Sq. from the end of the road the house is on, or walk into the centre which takes 15 minutes. The home was in a safe area."
The room is self enclosed and fully furnished with things you need to have a pleasant stay – microwave and fridge.  I was left to get on with things,and kept myself to myself,but if I had any queries Bill and Susan were ready to help.  They also helped me settle in,despite having very busy professional lives.,,
I will make this my number one place to stay if I return to Cambridge/Boston,MA.,,,,

72811,275570,2011-05-22,598253,Ron,"Bill was a wonderful host. He responded to all of my questions via email and cell phone in a timely manner. Due to my schedule, I was unable to meet his wife. Hopefully, I will in the future. I had a very pleasant stay in their home. The location of their home is great. It is about a 5-10 minute walk to 3-5 different bus stops and 15 to 20 minutes from Harvard Square, where you can catch the Red line (subway). I did not have a car and was able to get to their home from BOS (logan) within an hour using MTBA ((URL HIDDEN) The room has a very comfortable bed, microwave and refrigerator."
72811,278937,2011-05-24,529964,Will,great value when all hotels were going for over $200/night

72811,321740,2011-06-19,458134,Myriam,"Very friendly and helpful hosts. I enjoyed my stay here. The house is nice, the room is well furnisched and the location is convenient (calm neighbourhood and public transport nearby), Bill patiently answered to all my questions before I arrived and gave me the information I needed when I was there. Maps of the city are on the wall and useful information already prepared when you arrive. It's a nice place to stay."
72811,335188,2011-06-26,173914,Mei-Yi,"I  had a very pleasant stay. The room provides all the many little amenities a traveller or tourist may need: from eating utensils to maps and guides of Boston put there by the host or left by others. I only met Bill, and he was very friendly and responded quickly when I encountered tornado alerts at O'Hare."
The location is good: a five minute walk takes you to a bus station (#66) which can take you to Harvard Square. And from there,you can take the T (subway) to anywhere around Boston. If you walk past the bus stop,you enter into town,where you can purchase stuff for your daily needs as well.,,

The area is a quick walk to Harvard Square. I highly recommend!"

72811,612087,2011-10-09,1200544,Anton,Unfortunately I caught a cold and cut my trip short before I could reach Boston but Bill was helpful in our initial chat.

The hosts are amazingly thoughtful, as you can notice by the way the room is nicely and carefully furnished to be both cosy and practical, and with great privacy from the rest of the house."

For people sensitive to smells,  when it rains, the house smells like an old house.  Overall, the room is very clean and adequate.  Sharing the bathroom with the boys is not the cleanest (like the Hilton), but for the price- it was very do-able!!!"
72811,711628,2011-11-12,1315361,Alexander,"Staying with Bill and Baifeng was a pleasure from end to beginning. They kindly accomodated me and were incredibly attentive when I had a question or needed something. If you have read their house manual and find yourself able and willing to adhere to these simple rules (which I think, are really only  an explication of how one should expect a civilized being to behave, anyway) you will find yourself in a safe neighborhood with a more than decent bed and space, and little worries. I plan to stay there again on my next trip to Boston, and I think that says it all."
72811,905659,2012-02-06,663680,Elliot,Bill and Baifeng were great hosts. They were available to answer my questions and responded to all of my requests. I would definitely stay there again in the future. The room was as advertised and the house manual made everything clear before and upon arrival.
72811,931851,2012-02-19,1722349,Dan,Bill and Baifeng were great hosts.  The room is right near the front door so it is very convenient and you don't feel like you will wake everyone up if you come back late.  The room is spacious yet cozy and there are plenty of blankets if it gets cold as well as a radiator if needed.  The bathroom is on the second floor but it was fine as far as cleanliness and convenience.  It would be a long walk to Harvard but the bus stop is only a couple blocks away and the bus ride to Harvard square is around 12 minutes.  Bill and Baifeng are wonderful to talk to and very willing to answer any questions.  Bill even lent me a towel since I forgot mine.  They will be my fist choice whenever I'm up there again!
72811,954849,2012-02-27,1722349,Dan,"I liked staying with Bill and Baifeng so much, I made another reservation!  They are wonderful hosts and offer a very comfortable room with easy access to Harvard or MIT.  You will not be disappointed if you book with Bill and Baifeng!"

72811,1067984,2012-04-01,1614866,Anna,"i stayed at bill and baifeng home for 5 days and really enjoyed my first airbnb experience. The house manual is quite helpful especially if you have never used airbnb before so you know what to expect before your arrive. The room had everything you needed plus the added bonus of a fridge, t.v and microwave and the house was always warm after a cold day sightseeing in boston. Good for independant travel as the room is right near the front door. Good location and public transport couldn't be easier. highly recommended."

Bill and Baifeng were both lovely hosts and very helpful with all questions.,,,,,
The room is simple but well furnished with really helpful details like a bar fridge and microwave,which makes a big difference for stays longer than a few days (I was there a week). The house manual is a good indication of the room and style of place - common sense rules and respect go both ways,and the details in it are self-explanatory / enable you to have freedom and independence while sharing Bill and Baifeng's home.,,,
Would definitely stay there again. Thanks Bill & Baifeng,"it was nice to meet you.\"",,,,

72811,1504621,2012-06-18,2228956,Ryan,"Though I didn't get to meet Baifeng, as she was away for the duration of my stay, I will say that Bill was a pleasant host who asked me several times if I was enjoying my stay and if I needed anything. Their house is ideally located between Cambridge and Allston / Brighton shops and restaurants. The only drawback I found with my stay was the overall cleanliness of the facilities offered to me, especially the guest bathroom, which seemed not to have been cleaned prior to my arrival."
72811,1733504,2012-07-17,1013572,Tilmann,"I only met Bill and got to know him as a friendly, generous and uncomplicated host. It was a pleasure staying at Bill's and Baifeng's place!"
The only downside (but it's really not their fault) was the extreme heat in Boston and the lack of a separate airconditioning in the room (the room has a ventilator,though).,,,,
I would be happy to stay there again!,,,,,

72811,1933300,2012-08-09,2898975,Yixin,I had a pleasant stay at Bill and Baifeng's. The location is close to public transportation -- about 15-minute walk to the closest green line T-train station. The area is safe. I had no problem walking on the street around 9:30pm in the evening. Bill and Baifeng are both very friendly and nice. The biggest issue is that the guest bathroom is not clean. The host could really improve on that. That's the biggest and only drawback to the place as far as I'm concerned.
72811,1962608,2012-08-12,3166641,Constantin,"Everything worked well and Bill made sure that we had everything we needed. Cleanlines could have been a bit better, but overall it was absolutely fine. The place is great to explore Cambridge by foot!"

72811,2308353,2012-09-17,3230853,Hidefusa,"I appreciated many aspects of this residence. It was a quiet 25-minute walk to Harvard Square, and there's a quiet library 10 minutes away by foot. (There is a bus stop nearby but I opted to walk.) The room I stayed in was spacious, clean, and the refrigerator was useful for keeping water cool. The WiFi worked seamlessly, and the guest bathroom and shower were very clean. In contrast to other hostels I stayed at, this residence was situated in a quiet neighborhood which permitted sleep and rest at night. The hosts were very compassionate, and I am glad I had the chance to stay at their residence. This was the first time I used AirBNB."
72811,2407974,2012-09-25,1528863,Burgundi And Bart,"It  was nice to stay at Bill and Beifengs.  They are  friendly, warm people.  The room was nice and quite.  It was close to where  I was visiting .  I was able to find parking nearby.  I would stay there again."
72811,2486814,2012-10-02,3458461,Jessica,"Bill & Baifeng son encantadores, la habitación es bastante espaciosa y se duerme muy bien."
La única pega es la ubicación,por la noche y en fin de semana la frecuencia de los autobuses baja mucho y hay que coger un taxi para llegar hasta allí.,,,,
Pero bueno,"por el precio de la habitación comparado con otros te lo puedes permitir.\"",,,,
72811,2642699,2012-10-17,3617645,Angelica,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Bill's place in October for 3 nights. It is convenient if visiting the Cambridge area, not so much if you find yourself spending lots of time near downtown. It is very accessible by subway and bus and walking distance to several restaurants in the area. Bill was very friendly and hospitable."
We felt the room was okay but the bathroom could have been cleaner. Also,the bed was pretty uncomfortable. After the first night,I decided I'd be better off sleeping on the floor and,as a result,had a much more restful night!,
"I would not stay here again. I'd rather stay close to Downtown/North End.\"",,,,,
72811,2698876,2012-10-24,3424749,Denise,very next to bus stop in a quiet area. in the room there are microwave and fridge and wireless. Bill and his family are very kind and openmind persons. we had a wonderful stay by them. we loved map at door with all signatures of guests.
72811,2760722,2012-10-30,3593415,Bob,"This was a generally positive experience. The actual room is pretty much as it looks, and is more than adequate. The location is easy walking distance from the Cambridge area, and the neighborhood is not new, but many of the houses are well kept."
The guest bathroom is exactly as it is reviewed by others. Cluttered with open toothpaste tubes evident.,,,,,
Also I was disappointed with the host's evident refusal to grant a refund for the last night. I had to leave Boston on very short on the day that Sandy arrived. Train service was going to be suspended,"so I could not give the notice that the host specifies. Which was not my fault. I requested a refund [twice] and both e-mails were unanswered. Which is unfortunate.\"",,,,
72811,2809913,2012-11-05,3722528,Kriszta,Bill and Susan are very cool hosts. The room is very comfortable and affords privacy. I had a great time for a fantastic price.
72811,2907064,2012-11-18,3905300,Srinivas Prasad,"The hosts were really friendly, I had a wonderful stay with them :)"
72811,3002375,2012-12-01,3230853,Hidefusa,"In comparison to the hostels I've stayed, I'm glad I found this residence. The nights are quiet, the proximity to Cambridge is just great, and, the room is spacious. I've used the fridge several times to keep food and drinks I purchased from the nearby 7 Eleven."
72811,3044695,2012-12-08,3230853,Hidefusa,"The room was cozy. The bed was comfy. I slept well at night, in this quiet residential neighborhood."
72811,3073171,2012-12-11,3172280,Lorenz,"We had a great and uncomplicated stay at Bill's and Baifeng's place and . Some people might be bothered by the somewhat untidy bathroom,  but I didn't mind and the room was perfect for my stay in Boston. Definitely again!"
72811,3092053,2012-12-15,3230853,Hidefusa,"Nights are always quiet and cozy in this residential neighborhood. Convenient proximity (walking distance, 5 minutes) to a library, 24-hour convenience store, and Dunkin Donuts. About a 20 to 25-minute leisurely walk to the Square. Hosts are kind and very accommodating to guests."
72811,3145710,2012-12-24,3806141,Hengbi,The location is great. The room is clean and well-organized. Guests have their privacy. Bill and Baifeng are very nice people to talk to.
72811,3540445,2013-02-14,4698753,Yun Sung,"I had worried about my staying this house because the host seemed very strict, but when I arrived there, the place was very comfortable and the host was very kind. It was very unfortunate that I couldn't stay there for a long time and have some time talking with this nice family. The bus station was just in front of the house, and it seemed safe near there."
72811,3590258,2013-02-19,1187373,Manish,Everything was great.
72811,3889736,2013-03-25,1315361,Alexander,"Well, what can I say but, I stayed with them again. is there a higher praise? I like that they have very clear rules, which, when you read them ahead, prevent any mishaps. The rules are basically what anyone should expect of a house guest anyway. And they offer a clean, welcoming please in a safe neighborhood and are very approachable when you have a problem. My personal motto when dealing with my students is: I will happily help you with your needs, but i have no time to cater to your whims. The Slaughters, in a nutshell, practice the same. And I think that's fair and they are my first choice whenever I got to stay in  Boston."
72811,4034510,2013-04-04,3819961,Yiwen,Great experience
72811,4518714,2013-05-10,5684496,Gladys,"La pieza es pequeña, y no estaba muy limpia ni ordenada. Tienen una cama nido, de 1 plaza cada una. Los colchones"
están protegidos con una bolsa de plástico,por lo que suena cada vez que uno se mueve,y el cuerpo transpira mucho. El baño se comparte con los hijos,y estaba bastante sucio. Entre las reglas de la casa esta que nos puede usar la cocina,y aunque le entregan platos y servicio desechable,igualmente se requiere lavar fruta o alguna otra cosa para comer
72811,4656334,2013-05-18,4515456,Nicholas,Great place to say with wonderful hosts.
72811,4708079,2013-05-21,5832484,Anne,"\"CHARMING people and charming room! Comfortable and quiet! We definitely recommend this place! We spend 3 lovely days in Boston \"\" Grâce à eux et à cet endroit \"\" ! \""
72811,4875505,2013-05-30,70048,Luke,"Our stay here was pleasant. Within close driving distance to all of Bostons attractions. Located in a nice neighborhood, with available street parking. B&B had plenty of material laid out in the room for exploring the city, and were pleasant people to chat with.  The shared bathroom was a little tricky, but overall a great place to stay."
72811,4994444,2013-06-06,2584553,Shipeng,Great location if you want to visit HBS often. Both hosts are very nice.
72811,5164170,2013-06-16,6423922,Sarah,Great place to stay! It was a nice room with a nice family. I hope to be back soon. :)
72811,5262455,2013-06-21,6472341,Annie,Thank you Bill and Baifeng - you were very gracious hosts. My stay was pleasant and comfortable. The area was very safe and well connected. The room was very private and I will definitely stay again.
72811,5463751,2013-07-01,6608474,Richard,"Bill was a gracious host. Our son even got to practice his French a little one evening! The location is great - a block or two from a bus that runs to Harvard Square in one direction or the Green Line in the other. We just walked to the Green Line; it was an interesting 10-15 minute walk. The bus to Watertown/Central Square is just a few blocks away too. If you use the T, get a Charlie Card (different from a Charlie Ticket) first at a convenience store (you can't always get them at T stations) and you'll save a lot of money."
72811,5517040,2013-07-03,124361,Toni,"I really enjoyed my stay with Bill And Baifeng. Bill was especially helpful with my early arival/check in and made me feel very welcome. The house is well located, a short walk to the bus stop or Alston bars/restaurants. Great if you are visiting Harvard. I appreciated the privacy that the room offered. Would definitely recommend to others."
72811,5944301,2013-07-23,2402615,Billy,"Great place to stay. Easy to work with. Very close to Harvard, and close to train to get to Fenway. Nice quiet older neighborhood. Bill and Baifeng are very friendly people. Read their house rules up front and you will know exactly what to expect.  I enjoyed my visit."
72811,6218901,2013-08-04,2812364,William John,"I had a nice stay at Bill and Baifeng's place. It is in a fun part of Boston and not far from Cambridge. The room, without being fancy, serves its purpose perfectly. I had a nice stay there."
72811,6334752,2013-08-08,7813429,Hank,It is a very lovely and cozy place. It is not far from Cambridge. Bill is very hospitable person. We have our own bathroom and the room in on the first floor away from the landlord. We really appreciate that we had a chance to stay there. Wish everyone also has a nice chance to stay there for your vacations.
72811,6371034,2013-08-10,3230853,Hidefusa,"The stay is located in a quiet residential community that's a short walk from Harvard campus, and was very spacious and clean for the solitary traveler like myself. Bill and Baifeng are great hosts, very accommodating and welcoming. It's always a pleasure to stay."
72811,6471514,2013-08-13,1894554,Stephanie,"Baifeng and Bill were both very kind upon our very brief meetings in passing. This airbnb is like a studio apt rental, the only thing you need outside of the room is the bathroom (assuming you don't need to do laundry or use a full kitchen). The listing is very thorough and I found all information provided to be accurate though we were a bit surprised to see the single bed and trundle bed rather than a typical double (we probably just didn't note that in the listing somewhere, no big deal). Yes, things in the bathroom area are a bit lived in so if you do not enjoy a bit of teenage style mess than this isn't the place for you. For us it was a great deal, a great location and perfect for the independent travelers we happen to be. No AC but a fan kept things cool during the hours we were there to sleep. Hope the review helps. Thanks Bill and Baifeng for making sure we had everything we needed."
72811,7253301,2013-09-13,7990950,Richard,"We spent there two days. Everything was perfect. It is close to Harvard and 15 minutes from subway. If you are looking for an accommodation - this is perfect place. Room is cozy, with TV, wifi and comfortable bed."
Highly recommended!,,,,,

72811,8322113,2013-10-25,8492089,Romain,We spent two adorable days at Bill And Baifeng house ! Very well located (20 minutes walking from Harvard Square) in a quiet neighborhood. Highly Recommanded !
72811,8353512,2013-10-27,9234964,Delia,"Bill and BaiFeng were good hosts.they were friendly and (URL HIDDEN) was well located,  Harvard Square near.that's well for me."
72811,8906747,2013-11-25,1248972,Alan,I had a great stay with Bill and Baifeng.  I was out at a conference pretty much the whole time so our interaction was minimal.  But Bill was very helpful.
72811,9218487,2013-12-14,3230853,Hidefusa,"I've stayed here on numerous occasions, but it's always a comfortable, relaxing, and clean place to stay. The proximity to Harvard by foot (20 minutes) or bus (5 minutes) is great, and, there's a deli nearby. Bill and Baifeng are great hosts!"
72811,9389803,2013-12-25,2473626,Ted,"Everything was as advertised, and it's a good deal for the price. I just needed a place to crash near the Harvard Business School for two nights and this worked well for that. You might ask ahead of time where to find a towel - I didn't see it mentioned in the notes, and it took me a minute to find one early in the morning."
72811,16172124,2014-07-22,18097963,Alessia,"La stanza è abbastanza grande e pulita, il bagno un po' meno. Il cuscino a mio parere andrebbe lavato tra un ospite e l'altro, soprattutto in estate perché puzzava. Per il resto il proprietario è stato molto gentile. L'unica pecca è che la casa è molto lontana dai trasporti pubblici quindi mi sono dovuta muovere in taxi o con Uber."
72811,16534404,2014-07-28,18866958,Simon,"Me and my wife decided at the last min to visit Boston on Friday and we found this location.  We knew we are going to arrive late so we send a message ahead to ask if it is okay.  Within couple of min, Bill accepted our request and he is super cool about the late arrival.  When we arrived, the place is a bit different than the photo but it is a nice and cozy room which we need to crash for the night.  The room is full of tourism info which ppl left behind and Bill is extremely nice answering all the questions we had.  Overall, this is a great place to stay since it is close by Harvard and downtown Boston."
72811,17665408,2014-08-15,18012477,Gabriela,Everything was correct!
72811,19055749,2014-09-05,9441814,Alice,"This room is not as big and good as the pic shows. The air conditioner is too cold at night. But it's close to take bus to Harvard. Anyway, thanks for having us for two nights."
72811,19334998,2014-09-10,20430564,Eugene,Enjoyed staying with Bill and Baifeng! Very welcoming and courteous.

We were given great privacy when staying in our downstair room,and it was so cozy that we even got access to our own microwave and refrigerator. The best part about this house,which I would say is its pretty safe and quiet neighborhood. It is also convenient for us to go around to visit the city,"especially the Harvard and MIT campus. We think this room is definitely a great choice for visitors. \"",,
72811,20288703,2014-09-27,3847837,DaFu,"The stay at Bill & Baifeng's house was great! Bill and Baifeng are really nice people and extremely interesting to talk to. The whole check-in process was easy and the apartment was in a great condition. On the day left, Baifeng even gave me a ride to the bus terminal. Highly recommended to any one who wants to visit to Boston. P.S It only takes 3 min to Harvard by bus."

72811,31262942,2015-05-03,27840002,Desiree,"Had a short stay at Mr. Bill & Mrs. Baifeng's place at a short notice. The place is easily accessible and easy to find. An Uber ride would be $10-14 into Downtown depending on peak and off-peak time. Otherwise, bus stops are close. Closest subway is Harvard St. on the green line with a 15-20 minute walk. The area is best for anyone who enjoys Asian cuisine as the neighborhood has numerous Asian restaurants and seem to have a significant amount of Asian residents. At first, the place seemed dodgy to me as I was a lone female traveler, but I was able to walk back home from the subway safely on a Fri night. I'd say the area is pretty safe."
As for the house and room itself,everything is exactly as described by the manual. As requested,don't forget to call the day before you arrive. It's for your own benefit! I was afraid how strict the house would be after reading the description,but the hosts are just very thorough. Follow the rules,be respectful and the stay will be great. The hosts seem like very intelligent people,too. Minimal interaction but for the conversation we had

72811,42194272,2015-08-11,31654643,Pauline,"Bill was very hospitable and the room was well equipped with all your basic needs for a short stay. Bill was super flexible about the check-in and check-out time, which worked great for my schedule. During my four-day stay, I had to squeeze in time to work remotely, and so the desk/internet and microwave, and mini-fridge was super convenient for my needs. They also had extra towels and extra blankets readily available for your comfort. It's a short walk to some delicious food spots, and also nearby the bus stop and T station."

They were both very welcoming,communicative and flexible with the arrival and departure times,and were insistent that I was to make myself at home. I'm especially thankful that Bill was so understanding when we were playing telephone tag,leaving clear and helpful voicemails when I was in and out of meetings.,,
The room was exactly as described - clean,tidy and comfortable - while the air conditioning was particularly good given the heat in Boston.,,,,
Transport was very straightforward (5 minute bus or 15 minute walk to Harvard Square,followed by a 10 minute subway to central Boston),both to downtown Boston and to Fenway Park.,,,

Her house is only a 20 minute drive to Boston. The subway station is only a couple miles from her house which we took to get into Boston. Erin was very friendly and made us feel welcome.
11441717,68611486,2016-04-05,61441206,Shawn,This was my first AIRBNB stay and it was a great experience for me. Erin provided great hospitality and I could not have asked for a better host. Also she has 2 very adorable kitties who aren't shy with guests!

The home is very clean and inviting and there were no issued whatsoever. The amenities were perfect for our stay and we would definitely love to stay there if we take a trip back to the Northeast. Thank you again for your hospitality, Erin!"
11441717,76946526,2016-05-29,8785059,Stefanie,"Erin got in touch with me right away after booking the room to ask if I had any questions. We just used the room for a comfortable night's sleep, so didn't spend too much time with Erin, but she was very friendly."

1341072,16631092,2014-07-30,3807637,Gary,"Ally has a great location in Back Bay with everything I needed to be comfortable. Her rooftop deck has an amazing view. Ally was a very generous and thoughtful host, and even offered a bottle of wine. Recommended."
1341072,16696148,2014-07-31,7399448,Rich,"Ally was great. We had no trouble meeting up, the apartment was clean, in a great neighborhood, and very convenient for our needs. You need to be able to navigate a narrow spiral staircase to climb into the loft bed, which I found fun, but I wouldn't recommend it for older renters. Ally was very upfront about it before I reserved, and it's in the pictures."
1341072,16792811,2014-08-02,11731208,Julius,"Ally was a great host. She made sure we had clean towels and water to drink, and was very friendly. The living space was clean and homely. It's also in a GREAT neighborhood! The location in Back Back is within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and the Charles River. Would definitely recommend!"
1341072,16858755,2014-08-03,18100196,Doug,Ally was punctual and responsive. The apartment is in a great location and very cozy and tidy. The whole experience beats staying at a hotel in the area and is much cheaper. I highly recommend the place.
1341072,16940669,2014-08-04,6103490,Tyler,"Great airbnb.  Ally was a gracious host, met us at the apartment at a convenient time.  The apartment was spacious, clean, and in a great neighborhood, central to much in Boston. The loft bed was peculiar, and being taller we certainly had to make sure we fit, but was comfortable and a great place to stay."
1341072,17082764,2014-08-06,19134482,Neil,"Great apartment, great location, great host!"
Ally's place in Back Bay was comfortable,clean,and much better than staying in a hotel. This was the first time I've ever used Airbnb and thanks to Ally and her place I'm hooked. Ally went above and beyond to make my stay the best it could be and even did some of my laundry when there was no detergent in the apartment.,,,
"Highly recommended! Would stay there again!\"",,,,,
1341072,17245591,2014-08-09,11246783,Cody,"We stayed at Ally's place for three nights in Boston.  It's a great location, especially if you plan to use the Hubway bikes at all - there's a station 1 block away."
The apartment was pretty clean,and stocked with essential in the kitchen. We didn't cook any meals there,but could have made something simple if necessary.,,,
It was hot during our stay in Boston,but the apartment is on the first floor,and doesn't receive too much direct sun. With the window AC and a small fan,we were able to keep pretty cool.  The AC wasn't too effective for the loft bed,"but the fan kept air moving.\"",
1341072,17404784,2014-08-11,7268335,Anita,"Ally is perfect host. very caring and very helpful. Apartment itself  - well it's really small and calling it one bedroom is a bit of a stretch. What makes it one bedroom is the added loft, but if you were to put actual bed in that space - it's clearly not possible. Also - what captured my attention on the pictures was that it looked like apartment is not 'in use' and is meant for guests only. But actually all the storage spaces were pretty much taken by whomever was staying there besides that weekend we were in there. We made the space work for us and again - the location is amazing, the building and apartment itself is a treasure. Beautiful, clean and furnished with great taste."
1341072,17597098,2014-08-14,8439195,Luke,"She was very accommodating, and really lovely to deal with. The rooftop is fun, great views. perfect little find."
1341072,18484899,2014-08-27,18542343,Harriet,Ally's place in Boston is fantastic. The photos are a very clear display of the place and Ally is very easy to deal with!
The neighbourhood is fantastic,plenty if great places to eat,"drink and shop just down the road on Newbury street and a station only 5 mins walk away. I would happily stay here again \"",,,
1341072,18992529,2014-09-04,3833315,Elena,"Ally was a wonderful host.  When we got there she helped us with our luggage and even offered to get milk & other grocery items.  Her apartment was nice and clean.  It's also in a great location.  Not only is it very close to my son's school, the surrounding area has a lot of restaurants and shops.  I definitely recommend this place.  It's better and more economical than staying at a hotel."
1341072,19218048,2014-09-08,2278271,Matt,"Ally was wonderful. She was responsive and made sure we were able to get in smoothly. There was clear information there when we arrived about coming and going and restaurants, etc. in the neighborhood."
The neighborhood is great. Very close to shopping,restaurants,and cafes. Walking distance to Fenway and a 10 minute train ride to many tourist attractions.,,,

1341072,19372159,2014-09-11,19412956,Mariano,"We had a fantastic stay at Ally's place. Ally is a great host, she gave us a all the information around the area: supermarket, pharmacy, late dining, etc. It was very useful. No surprise whatsoever regarding the apartment, pictures accurately reflect what it looks like. The location is unbeatable!"
1341072,19599469,2014-09-15,15288670,Brad,"Ally was very nice. Easy to work with and helpful. The apartment is as described but not quite what I was expecting.  Be aware there is not a bedroom but a sleeping loft.  Which can get quite warm and the A/C was a very weak window unit.  Wouldn't matter except in summer time.  The unit is very old and quaint. A nice enough place in a wonderful location, just be aware of what you are renting."
1341072,19780734,2014-09-18,355513,Jojo,"Excellent location! And Ally was great to work with. It's a small apartment, but enough space for me and my husband. The 'bedroom' location is not for everyone, as you will have to climb a very narrow spiral staircase to get to it. So you'd have to be of certain size and probably certain fitness as well :)"
Again,"this worked fine for us. We didn't use the kitchen as there are tons of restaurants nearby and we like to eat out when in Boston. \"",,,,
1341072,20007680,2014-09-22,5532478,Lizzie,"Ally was an excellent host and the department was wonderful, perfectly located and very cozy.  She was ready to help in whatever we might need and if we return to Boston I would surely contact her again."
1341072,20150365,2014-09-24,13875164,Mitchell,Ally was very accommodating with easy communication and check-in/out. The apartment is ideal of one or two people and ideally located near Copley/Hynes.

It's about a 20 minute walk from the beginning of the Freedom Trail, 15 minute walk to Fenway, and Cheers! is about 5 minutes away. It was a perfect place to stay for us to enjoy the city. The apartment itself has a few quirks which can be expected for an older apartment in Boston, but it is still nice. The lofted bed leaves ample room for living space, but if you're looking for more of a \"\"hotel\"\" feel"

This was a great stay,the apartment was as described on the listing,great location with amazing views from the roof,great location for bars at Fenway,shopping down Newbury and the Prudential. Grab a coffee from Starbucks or DD just 5 mins walk on Newbury street,subway & bus are within 5 mins walk taking you over to Harvard or into the city.
The city is walkable anyway so head up Boylsdon to the common.,,,,,
Go for a run or walk down the Charles River great to see the city in a different way.,,,,,

The apartment location is perfect. Its few steps to the Commonwealth,Newbery St,Boylstone St. and so close to Charles river,commonwealth and public parks and many so interesting places.,,
I won't recommend this apartment for more than two night. It's located on first floor and old furnished. The door is barely closed and locked from both side,no locks on windows which make it not so secure. There are so many bugs and mosquitos that caused many scratches and itches on my body and found bees in room and bathroom several times.,,,,
There were some food in the refrigerator and cabinets and there was tea in the pot. So are the bathroom so many used things were there. The apartment wasn't really clean.,,,,,
The bed is located on a high wooden board which almost steady. You have to be careful when you open windows shutters,one had fell down while my friend tried to open it up. The building smells marijuana almost all the time.,,,,
It's not a good choice for relaxation,so much noise not a quiet place.,,,,
The price of the apartment is shown on AIRBNB in dollars but they charged me the same amount in euros which wasn't fair and cost me much than i expected and doesn't worth that much. The AIRBNB wasn't helpful at all about that and didn't clarify this situation. With every mail i sent they gave me a different answer and directions.,,,,,
"That was a nightmare  \"",,,,,

There were clean towels, dishes, and silverware for our use. We really appreciated the bottle of wine and waters. The location was ideal. Not only was it central to everything, it was quiet and felt very safe. A short walk took us to Fenway, MIT, and Boston Common; while taking the train to/from the airport, the North End, and Charlestown couldn’t have been easier. For our 5 day stay, we always came “home” to a great night sleep. Thanks for letting us use your great place, Ally!"

There is the Green and Orange Line close by and a Hubway bike rack a block away for everything else."
"Her place is comfortable - exceedingly clean!  The bed was unusual for me - climb narrow winding stairs and crawl into the bed.  No room to stand but I got really fond of it.\"",,,,,
1341072,51452820,2015-10-20,43764625,Shelly,"Ally was an excellent host. We arrived later than expected because of some delayed transportation so Ally offered to pick us up at the airport.  We were unable to accept, but when we finally arrived, she was warm and friendly and was there within 2 minutes to provide the keys.  She was available by text during our stay if we needed her, but we didn't have any urgent needs.  In the apartment, she had bagels and fruit/cheese and even a bottle of wine waiting for us, which was a very nice touch.  The apartment is in a great location.  It's within walking distance of many of the places you'd like to visit; Boylston St., Newbury for shopping or restaurants, and the Commonwealth Avenue Mall, which is an amazing park-like walkway that stretches the expanse of Commonwealth Avenue.  There is an actual mall for shopping at the Prudential Tower, also within walking distance.  And for the history part of your trip, the apartment is only a few blocks from a T stop to take you downtown.  It's fairly easy to use and gets you anywhere in town within minutes.  The bed in the loft worked out fine for us, but could pose a problem for the elderly or someone with knee issues and there is a smoker in the building who doesn't seem to have any regard for any of the other tenants.  The apartment itself didn't smell too strongly of smoke, only a little bit, but the building does.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this condo for its location and its host."

Ally was a great host. The check-in was super convenient. The place is walking distance from some amazing restaurants. The apartment itself is super cozy,well-lit,has a wonderful breakfast area overlooking the garden and is very well stocked (well stocked kitchen,bathrooms and we even found the much needed iron and ironing board). Enough space next to the living room to open up your luggage. Clean linen and towels.,,
Ally had all the important information (groceries,restaurant recommendations,pharmacy details) pasted on the fridge and she even left a wine bottle for us.,,,
There was a constant smoke smell from the neighbor - Ally informed us that the residents of the building are trying to get the neighbor to stop that. The smell,however,was limited to the living room and did not bother us at night. And the place was so wonderful,we could easily ignore it.,,

Forget the 'air' part, the accommodation had all the touches of a really nice B&B, where the hosts had thought of everything, from nice soap to tea kettle in the room. Tom was great with quick response on communication and flexibility for arrival. Parking is so rare in Boston and bus connections to downtown and Cambridge were easy to make. We had plans out of the neighborhood, but there were many options very close at hand for food, drink and shopping.

Много кафе , где очень вкусные завтраки. Обедали мы в городе. В то же время до центра 15 мин. на автобусе. Автобусы ходят часто. Нам было очень комфортно ."
3181719,33181849,2015-05-25,33243560,Carla,"Tom and Elly went out of their way to make us feel welcomed to their home and to Boston. Their house was clean, spacious, comfortable, and they were very helpful in providing directions and recommending locations in Boston. Their house is a quick walk to the 57 bus which can transfer you to the Kenmore station (about 15-20 min ride). Overall an easy commute to anywhere you want to go to Boston. We cant thank Tom and Elly enough for being such wonderful hosts. If you want a great Boston experience, we highly recommend staying with these wonderful people!"
3181719,35079828,2015-06-15,725115,Shazia,"It was an amazing experience staying at Tom and Elly's place. Great location, Great host and neighborhood. My son goes to BU and it was an ideal location for me because of it's proximity to bus stop. I was little hesitant in the beginning when i booked through Airbnb, because i've never done this before. I can't explain how gracious, kind and warm both husband and wife are. They made us feel so comfortable in their home that is unbelievable. Above all i feel it's hard to find couple this amazing these days."
If you have such great hosts it makes your trip relaxing and fun!!!,,,,,

3181719,41961220,2015-08-10,34885466,Danielle,"Tom and Evelyn enhanced our Boston experience by their warm and welcoming hospitality. A nice breakfast was always ready, maps and guides were on hand, and their expert advice regarding buses and metro was invaluable. We particularly enjoyed chatting with them and appreciated their calling a taxi for our departure. Couldn't ask for better hosts."
3181719,42517204,2015-08-14,25192,Nancy,"Friendly and interesting hosts, Tom and Elly made us feel very comfortable and welcome in their home. It was very conveniently located close to public transportation with a private, safe parking spot  for our car."
The room was spacious with a very comfortable foam bed with very soft sheets.,,,,,
They were so generous with food,wine,condiments and best of all their conversation!,,,

The accommodation was true to the posting listed.  I loved that fact that there was easy access to the bus line, eateries and breakfast each day.  Additionally, a full bathroom for our exclusive usage.  The room we were assigned was extremely comfortable for the three of us."

3181719,50074229,2015-10-09,30672263,Wally,"We had a wonderful experience with Tom and Ellie. They were gracious hosts and provided a home away from home atmosphere. They prepared a scrumptious continental breakfast and great conversation. They were very helpful in giving directions, locations of amenities, and visitor information.  They were conscientious about finding out special needs or preferences. Our only regret was not being able to spend more time there. The neighborhood was convenient to all public transportation and had several quaint restaurants or cafes in walking distance. The upstairs bedroom and bath were excellent, clean, tastefully decorated, and quiet."
3181719,51449500,2015-10-20,43452321,Linda,"I was greeted warmly by both Tom and his wife, even though I got there rather late on a Friday night. The rooms (bed and bath) met my expectations and then some. I had the second floor of their home which made it very private. Their home was on a quiet street and they kept a very quiet house as well. They gave me my privacy but were also warm and friendly when I entered the common space."

The private bath , parking and convenient location makes this an excellent place to stay in Boston. Brighton is a quick bus ride to the major sites and transit hubs. You will be welcomed by the perfect hosts -- friendly with great tips and conversation. I hope to come back!!"

We used their kitchen and laundry. When we chatted with Ellie about our visit in Boston, she provided us very helpful tips for visiting the town. Overall we had a good time staying in their house. Thanks a lot, Tom and Ellie!"
3181719,57629645,2015-12-28,24985975,Meri Lee,We had a wonderful week. Everything was exactly as described and more. Tom and Elly made us feel welcome and were very helpful. We hope to come back next time. The room was quiet and comfortable with everything in walking distance.
3181719,68611709,2016-04-05,28189965,Chris,"Staying with Tom and Ellie is like visiting old friends!  They are so welcoming and generous you won't want to leave.  Lovely big bedroom and bath with lots of windows and light, comfy bed, plush towels.  They provide snacks and drinks and yummy coffee.  A big plus is the parking provided.  Most nice Boston neighborhoods don't allow parking without a resident parking sticker and being able to just pull right up to the house is really nice.  Great neighborhood.  I'll never stay in a hotel again!"
3181719,70288770,2016-04-17,52948718,Glenny,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was fantastic! The accommodations are very nice. Bedroom and bathroom are clean and bright, bed is comfortable (my daughter slept on a futon, which was also comfortable) and the house is on a quiet cul-de-sac. It is a very easy bus ride to/from downtown and there are many good restaurants close by. Very nice continental breakfast in the morning. Tom and Ellie are two of the kindest and most gracious hosts that I've ever stayed with anywhere. I really felt like I was staying with my aunt and uncle -  they were really that nice! They are also both super interesting. Ellie is a university professor as well as a wedding officiant. Tom..well...Tom is just a world class character, having been a fighter pilot, test pilot, world sailor, law student, entrepreneur and author. His stories are amazing! Honestly, I wish that we'd had more time during our trip to spend talking with both of them. My daughter will be going to school in Boston, so I'm looking forward to staying here again so that I can spend more time with Tom and Ellie in their very nice home. Thanks Tom and Ellie for a wonderful stay!   Armant Legendre"

We needed to arrive at a certain time to meet a family obligation, and even though it was not a great time for them, they made accommodations for us - and we are so grateful!  We had a full weekend planned with our daughters graduation, so unfortunately, we were not able to spend too much time visiting. Every encounter we did have was pleasant, engaging, and helpful. Thank you so much!"

3181719,81729684,2016-06-24,63171299,Ming,"We stayed in Tom and Elly's house for 10 nights and we absolutely love it. It was our first Airbnb experience and we all enjoyed it very much, especially our 11-year old son. He chatted t with Elly, learnt photography from Tom, and watched NBA games with them.  He liked it so much that he didn't want to leave when it was time to go home."
3181719,89954221,2016-07-30,26978230,June,"Tom and Elly are easy going, respectful and helpful. The room is spacious. Bathroom is right next to the bedroom. We have full privacy and also can go downstairs to chat with our hosts.  My baby son liked to play with Tom and Elly. Elly even read stories to my baby son. On the last day Elly and Victor(my baby son ) both got sick with the same symptoms.  See how close they are.:) Great experience in Boston!"
3181719,92770090,2016-08-10,71029478,David,Tom and his wife retained communication before we arrived and guided the taxi driver to their doorstep. They were helpful in directions to our destinations on public transportation. They provided us with healthy and deliciousbreackfast everyday morning. They were friendly helpful and intelligent conversation. They were perfect host and were only two short blocks to public transportation. They were familiar with all the attractions in Boston and directions to get thereand resterra
3181719,95527997,2016-08-20,10827789,Meghan,Tom and Ellie were great. They were friendly and had lots off information on the area.  We would definitely stay there again.
3181719,97507500,2016-08-27,16273543,Hu,"The house is near Boston College so the transportation is very convenient. Supermarkets, shops and restaurants are within walking distance. Tom and Elly are super nice and very friendly and helped us a lot. I would definitely choose this one if I'll ever come to Boston again."
9494212,54950546,2015-11-25,39446161,Daniel,"Natalia was an awesome host, she have a very good space and make her visitors fell home. Couldn't have a better experience."
9494212,64025993,2016-02-28,12368505,Katy,"Space was great! Just what we were looking for! Quiet, clean, nice host who was very easy to communicate with. Have already recommended to others!"
9494212,65671091,2016-03-16,40597961,Karen,"The room is very nice and spacious, the third bed is somewhat small, but okay for a short stay. There are I think 2 extra rooms to share the bathroom with, so sometimes there's a wait, but that's expected. Also, since the house is old, though well kept, the floors creak so light sleepers might wake up. Overall we had a nice stay, the train stop is about a 10min walk and only about 15/20min from the city center. I would suggest brining your own toiletries, but towels are provided. The host is very accommodating and give us a short tour or the kitchen, balcony and tv room."
9494212,65920523,2016-03-18,42549142,Hyun,"For my family's trip to Boston, we chose to stay in Natalia's place based on previous reviews. As previous reviews say, Nat's place is spacious and cozy enough for three of us to stay. We arrived there around 6pm but had no problem to park the car on street and check in the place. Natalia frequently took care of us asking if we're okay and in need anything. She is an excellent bnb host. The place is very near to downtown Boston. It took us less than 15 minutes from Nat's place to downtown Boston by car even during rush hour. The neighbor is pretty much safe and quiet. Free wifi, bottled water, and coffee are provided so you can help yourself. Overall, Natalia's place is very good place for your trip to Boston."

She was an amazing host and the room was really spacious just like it said in the listing. The area was ideal, just 5 minutes away from the train which connects you to all of  Boston. Hope to book agian!"
9494212,70698002,2016-04-19,53065860,Danielle,"Although Natalia was away on a work trip while we stayed, she was responsive and able to help us via phone and was always available. The room was super clean and very comfortable. Everything we needed was provided to us. The house is shared with a few other guests, and our neighbors were awake very early (4:30AM). That being said it was a very positive experience overall and we would love to stay with Natalia again."
9494212,71332704,2016-04-24,23429259,Gregory,"Natalia was an excellent host! I had people showing up and plans changing, and she was helpful throughout  all of it, even with all the extra trouble I put her through! I will definitely stay there again in the future, no issues with the location."
9494212,71698752,2016-04-27,34143119,王,"clean room,kindness"
9494212,72442959,2016-05-02,66051875,Michael,Natalia was an excellent host with great recommendations in the neighborhood. Her place is conveniently located near the red line which will take you all over boston for a super cheap rate ($2.50 per trip). I would definitely recommend visiting boston and staying with Natalia!
9494212,73629243,2016-05-09,53607971,Olga,"Natalia was an excellent host! She made sure everything was in order for our stay. We had towels, shower things, earplugs, snacks, everything we needed. The only downside was a bathroom shared between three rooms -- high traffic at times. Would stay here again!"
9494212,74222636,2016-05-14,19013902,Onur,"Nathalie is a very nice host. She contacts you if/when you need help or any questions. The place is very close to the Red Line. The house is very spacious, as indicated. I would recommend to stay at her place, especially for couples who want a decent place without having to pay too much."
9494212,75722513,2016-05-22,66129991,Dongliang,"Natalia is very nice,and the room is cozy and very close to subway station."
9494212,76056482,2016-05-24,67609876,Verena,"Natalia was a nice host. Overall our stay with her was good. Location is convenient to the Shawmut subway station. However, we did not expect the place to be so crowded. One bathroom and the kitchen had to be shared among a total of 12 people which was not acceptable for me. Since some people actually did not clean up after themselves as Natalia is asking everyone to do, the cleanliness was not all that great."
9494212,76524758,2016-05-28,16095967,Pj,"Listing was accurate and getting into the house using the key lockbox was easy. Location is out in the boonies, which is fine since Boston is small, and the T is a few steps away, but just keep in mind it's no Back Bay."
9494212,77414675,2016-05-31,48207345,Elias,"Natalia was a terrific host, very helpful and welcoming. The room was comfortable and conveniently located. Would stay here again!"
9494212,77929938,2016-06-04,9552775,Laura,"Natalia was an excellent host! She was very accommodating with the check in and check out times and she had plenty of recommendations of what to do in Boston. My only issue with my stay was that there was only one bathroom for four rooms. There could be a long wait for the bathroom. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and I would stay there again!"
9494212,79218331,2016-06-11,6559399,Katie,Natalia was very friendly and welcoming to my husband and cat Cooper who all stayed in one of her Airbnb rooms this past week.  We were staying there while getting some work done on our house nearby and so it was really nice to have access to a full kitchen so we didn't have to eat out every night.  Natalia was accessible throughout our stay if we needed anything.
We were able to meet 8 other guests,from all over the country and globe,which was a neat way to spend a week.  I suggest talking with the other guests about a shower schedule if you have to be up and out of the house at a certain time,as we did.  For the most part,it worked very smoothly.,
The room is as pictured; the room is clean and the bed is comfortable.,,,,,
"Thank you Natalia for hosting us this past week - it was great to have met you!\"",,,,,
9494212,80116531,2016-06-16,71635033,Matthew,This was great place to stay.  The room was very clean as well as the whole house.  The best part was we were a 7 min walk from train saved lots of time and  money not using a taxi or Uber to get to city.  Natalia was very friendly and always willing to help.
9494212,81787678,2016-06-25,66342214,Anita,"Natalia was a great host. It was easy for us to get in, even late at night, and once we got in we found everything we needed in our bedroom. She greeted all of her guests and was easy to get a hold of if we had any questions. She even has some of her favorite places listed if you wanted to visit, she had maps available and also extra towels etc. if you needed it. We would definitely stay with this lovely lady again if we found ourselves in Boston again!"
9494212,85437330,2016-07-11,49307309,Tim,"We had a great stay at Natalia's place. The house is well set up for multiple guests, and has a nice lounge area we were able to use when we wanted some downtime. She has plenty of suggestions for things to do in the local area/Boston, and looks after her guests without being intrusive at all. Nice personal touches in the room with plenty of space and storage, and good attention to detail."
9494212,88221979,2016-07-23,77786782,Felipe,"Natalia was a great host! Even before I arrive in Boston, she helped me with everything that I needed and answered all my questions. Her house was perfect for me and my girlfriend. Everything was very organized and clean. The bathroom has a sign for organize the shower times and the refrigerator has this signs too. It was very helpfull. Everything is exactly how described in the description and in the pictures. Thanks again for everything Natalia."
9494212,88553861,2016-07-24,64798857,Kendall,"Excellent room, exactly as described. I never actually saw Natalia, but we texted back and forth and I was able to check in and out just fine. Comfortable bed, clean kitchen and bathroom. I would definitely stay here what again."

"Thanks for hosting us!\"",,,,,
9494212,91154700,2016-08-04,86532089,Elyse,Nice room cleanned and presented as described. Kitcheen and share space well organised.
9494212,91881747,2016-08-07,9069488,Sofia,"My experience was pretty bad because Natalia was out of the country and did not send me instructions how to get into the house. I called, emailed, texted but no response. AIRBNB told me to give them a couple of hours for them to try to contact Natalia, but it was already past 9 PM when I was told thay the house was NOT ready for check in. Natalia was nice enough to let me stay my second day at her place for FREE but then AIRBNB told me that I was NOT allowed to stay for free and threatened to take back the $150 that it offered me to find hotel last minute at 9 pm. Had to exchange several phone calls and emails with the AIRBNB Case Manager, which wasted a lot of time and energy. The whole experience was TERRIBLE. It is not worth saving a few dollars to stay here esp. when the owner is out of the country with no Internet access. The bed was also uncomfortable. Although Natalia did try to make it up to us, dealing with AIRBNB Case Manager was extremely stressful and time consuming. If you are going to be out of the country, please do not offer your house for AIRBNB."
9494212,92796996,2016-08-10,82939132,Karolina,"I haven't met Natalia but it was a great stay at her place. The room was big and clean, neighbourhood was beautiful and safe. I recommend it :)"

9494212,93455127,2016-08-12,82368938,Jordan,Our host was awsome! She double checked what time we would be arriving and sent instructions on how to get in when we were going to be later than expected because of delays. The room was perfect and the overall experience was great!
9494212,94098483,2016-08-14,57188213,Justin,"My stay was really great. Everything was clean, organized, and even with three other people it was quite. I had an exceptionally pleasant time."
9494212,96890505,2016-08-24,2108588,Andra,"Thr place looks like in the photos. We love the kitchen and the terrace..and the bed was really comfortable. The room was really clean and big. Fortunately we were only 2 people instead of free, because the extandable sofa didn't seem so comfortable. It was really great that natalia made a shower program, however even so we were about 9 people waiting for the shower/toillet. The location is 15min walk from the metro and very easy to get into town. Unfortunately, we never saw natalia...maybe next time."
9494212,97504323,2016-08-27,73061503,Joseph,Gorgeous home and wonderfully organised host.
"Loved my stay in Boston\"",,,,,
9494212,98734822,2016-09-01,46474076,Jacqueline,"Natalia was not only a wonderful host, but she also helped welcome us to Boston. We stayed at her Airbnb in between moving from Saint Louis to Boston and she made this transition so much easier. She welcomed us into her home and provided us with such a high level of comfort. I would recommend this lovely room to anyone who has the opportunity to stay in Boston."
9494212,98915497,2016-09-02,9759011,Suz,"Short but lovely stay witg smooth check in, great communication and all we needed :) thank you Natalia!"
9494212,99799766,2016-09-06,25087896,Chris,"The only thing I was concerned about getting there was the 1 bathroom, however, I had no issue of waiting to use the bathroom. The layout is spaced out so you don't feel like you are on top of anyone. Natalia was there to help and answer any of our questions."
6075481,32393919,2015-05-17,9612291,Lisa,"The apartment was anything but quaint, unless quaint is a euphemism for sub-par. We stayed one night. There was no air conditioning, which would  have been okay but the windows were locked shut and could not be opened. The only furniture was a card table, two chairs and a bed. There was a tiny little stove but no place to make coffee. It was dark, stuffy and very uncomfortable even for one night. The place looked run down and the mail box was broken. We paid the same for a nice hotel room by the airport the next day."

From the reviews I read and the pictures in the profile, the apartment was exactly as I expected.  The apartment was a great stay considering prices at nearby hotels were way overpriced.   thank you again!"

6075481,38543019,2015-07-16,3669867,Kini,Mike's communication was very prompt and the place is in perfect location right in the heart of everything. I have lived previously in Boston and it does not get better than this when it comes to location. Apartment was as advertised and relatively clean.
Mike also let me keep my bags till late evening as my flight was around that time. Apt was surprisingly roomy for a studio.,,,,,
"Otherwise apt is exactly as advertised and i highly recommend it if you are looking for the right location to stay in Boston. \"",,,,,
6075481,39581529,2015-07-24,39130785,Celia,Michael made us feel very welcome and the listing was exactly as it was advertised. The neighborhood and surrounding area was great and allowed us to walk to most places because of its central location.

6075481,39921965,2015-07-27,32217291,James,"Just finished a fantastic weekend in this listing! Booked in April and host (Micheal) was communicative (for months!), easy to deal with, responded rapidly, and a really good guy. Although an older building (small kitchen and bathroom, doesn't get a ton of natural light), the location of this place is amazing and trumps it hands down - especially if you're in town for Fenway Park which we were. Walking distance to the ballpark, Prudential Center, and only 20 mins walk from Quincy Market and the North End. Gorgeous brownstone lined streets - parallel to great shops, restaurants, and bars on Newbury Street. Space was very clean, had great clean linens,  and perfect size for our needs: a place to stay and shower so we could enjoy the wonderful city! This was our first time trying Airbnb and would do it again - especially this booking and locale when back in Boston! Thanks Michael!"

The location of the apartment was great. Although there is no air conditioning, the fan is sufficient. There is no wifi, but I was able to hookup to a public wifi and purchase access. The bed is beyond comfortable, and everything was clean."

He was extremely responsive and was right down the street if we needed him. The apartment was really nice and quaint; absolute best location. It was my first time with Airbnb and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The only thing that was rough, was that there wasn't air conditioning (obviously out of his control). The place was very clean and had everything we needed. I would definitely stay with Michael again!"

I arranged for the one night we stayed in his apartment at the very last minute, on the morning of my arrival, when my hotel fell through. He was very quick to respond and get the apartment ready for us, and he was very prompt in  communicating with me."
The apartment is in an amazing location,on a lovely street in a great neighborhood. The bed was very comfortable,as was the apartment itself. It should be noted that there's no sofa or tv,but that was fine for us as we only stayed the one night.,,
"The only \"\"problem\"\" was that in the morning we could definitely hear the people upstairs tromping around getting ready for work",as well as hear people leaving the building via the front door,which is right next to the apartment.,,,
Beyond that caveat,however,it was a great experience staying there. I would definitely recommend it,"especially if staying in a great location in the Back Bay is desired.\"",,
6075481,52333209,2015-10-28,32708708,Lucas,"Michael was a great host and his Back Bay location cannot be beat in Boston.   The neighborhood was fantastic and we didn't need any transportation other than our tennis shoes.   Great shopping, restaurants, and bars close by.   Also a short walk to Boston Commons, Freedom Trail, and Charles River Esplanade.   We had a blast!"
6075481,53401841,2015-11-08,43124721,Ed,"Michael was very communicative and helpful through the whole process, even accommodating my check-in and check-out times.  The apartment itself is amazing, much bigger than I expected and in a beautiful location.  Walking along Commonwealth right outside the doorstep in the morning was a definite highlight.  All of Back Bay is walkable, and a T-station a 5-10 minute walk away to explore the rest of Boston-- couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"
6075481,53839706,2015-11-13,45322838,Kathleen,"Plain and simple, Michael was a wonderful host.  He was always accessible via text or in person if I had a question or needed something.

6075481,89955554,2016-07-30,157721,Andreas,"Michael was kind enough not to cancel my booking even though he now needed the flat for himself, which I really appreciate. The location is quite dapper and feels very safe. There are plenty of bars, restaurants and metro stops around. The flat would be better suited for a visit during the colder months since there is no air conditioning (as clearly indicated in the ad, so no complaint here!), and it is a bit dark and could use a few more lamps, but overall is very cosy."
6075481,92430689,2016-08-08,58193458,Jake,"Michael was always quick with an answer to any questions we had (even stupid little ones). The apartment was perfect; great location, clean & inviting. We could not recommend enough!"

The apartment and the room that I stayed in were very clean, organized and comfortable. The porch attached to the room was very nice too. Jennifer was a great host. She made me feel very welcome at her place and helped me out a lot (recommending good places to eat in the area, loaning me her phone charger when I lost mine etc.). I will definitely want to stay there again if I go to Boston. I strongly recommend this place to Airbnb users."

She was super-friendly and helpful, giving me great tips on places to eat that would be near the apartment and near the convention center. She was also extremely understanding with my crazy hours (arriving on a late flight, having to leave early in the morning for the conference and not getting back until late). The only downside was the noise from the construction next door."
4445906,70691799,2016-04-19,11021695,Chris,"We came over for the Boston Marathon and really liked the apartment; it's in a great location and the facilities are excellent. Everything was exactly as described and the pool and gym were a real bonus and superb. The same property company seem to let out a number of these apartments in the block but were very helpful and available before, during and after our stay. Hard to find any faults except our keys were not available for the first 24 hours so they sent over another set. Also, as they have a number of apartments to rent out the rates can change quickly. I booked a 4 night stay and a couple of days later the price had dropped by over $400 for the same type of apartment! All in all a lovely place which I'd highly recommend."
4445906,72225502,2016-05-01,4992288,Tom,"Great apartment.  Everything was better than expected.  Excellent location, great views, comfortable beds...there is nothing they could have done better.  The level of communication was great and everything went smoothly."
4445906,93609362,2016-08-13,69362908,Ji Hyun,The place (660 washington street) is exactly the same as the host described. The place is just pure awesomeness. The only minor problem of the place is that the strength of the water in shower and bath is very weak.
However,the location of the place sucks.,,,,
As the place is located inside chinatown,it is extremely smelly once you step out the front door. Right out the front door,you will see some dangerous people smoking everywhere. Also as there is Tufts hospital nearby,you will wake up to the siren sound like every hour or so at night. Oh and there is a group of bikers biking up and down the street,waking up people every hour or so at night too. Seriously,for the location only
Anyway except for the location,"the place couldn't have been better. \"",,,,

He immediately made us feel welcome in his cozy home, and he gave us great recommendations for dining and sight-seeing in the area around his apartment.  We came in a little late and had to leave very early in the morning to catch a flight and he was very flexible with our check-in and check-out times.  The room was very comfortable and clean, and we felt right at home.  Thanks for making our short time in Boston great, Ilya!"
8118718,67540043,2016-03-30,21460152,Mirtza,"The location is perfect for early/late flights.  Walking distance from airport shuttle as well as the metro station.  Ilya provided with very good walking instructions to apartment.  Quick access to downtown Boston just a few stops away via the blue line.

Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen. Ilya hat uns alles in der Wohnung genau erklaert. Mit dem eigenen Schluessel konnten wir kommen und gehen wie wir wollten. Die Nachbarschaft ist ruhig, trotz Flughafen. Parkmoeglichkeiten sind in der Strasse nur fuer Anwohner. Fruehstuecken konnten wir im *Maverickmarket* sehr gut . Fussweg zur Metro etwa 10 Minuten.

5433246,66471008,2016-03-22,59521540,Danielle,"Description was entirely accurate, no issues in any way, and the neighborhood was amazing (but that was specifically why I was traveling - to scope out the area before I move there). Matt was super welcoming, and actually stayed up pretty late to make sure we got in and settled. He also left a map, travel descriptions, and a list of areas to see/things to do, which was very helpful for our trip! If for some reason I will go back to the same area, I would positively consider staying again if the time allows! Everything was great, and although we didn't stay inside much, when we did there was no reason to be concerned or caught off guard. Great trip, great host, highly recommend. We got to explore the city entirely on foot, and the apartment was in a very accessible area that greatly aided our travel plans."

He provided clean linens and toiletries. The apartment was as pictured, clean and comfy. If we had any questions, we'd send Matt a text and he'd reply in a few minutes."
The location was perfect! It's a couple of blocks away from two delicious bakeries--Flour and Blunch. If you stay here,you have to try them out! The apartment is also a short walk away from bus stops and subway lines,which will bring you anywhere in 10-20 minutes.,,,

It's at the center of everything and is in walking distance from clubs, bars, the water, and historic area. The climb up loft area was really cozy and comfortable."

6741968,40620986,2015-08-01,37081599,Ryan,Tiffany was wonderful and made every effort to ensure that my family and I were comfortable! The location of the apartment is the best in the city and the view from the roof deck is incredible. We would definitely stay here again.
6741968,41227726,2015-08-05,27130910,Katherine,"Tiffany was an excellent host and her home was the perfect spot for our stay in Boston. The loft apartment is definitely cozy, but it was the perfect amount of space for 3 of us. Tiffany was easy to communicate with throughout our stay and it was clear that she has put a lot of thought into making sure her guests are comfortable. Absolutely the kind of stay that makes airbnb so great."
6741968,41651966,2015-08-08,5774678,Kahron,"Tiffany was super communicative, and had a one-sheet showing me know where everything was surrounding the apartment. Also answered all my follow up questions as well. Zero complaints. Taller guys, careful on the stairs though. Fun spot. Centrally located - she even helped with Lyft/Uber. Never saw her, and she was still one of the best host I've encountered."
6741968,41971084,2015-08-10,16001424,Olivia,Super cute place! It was fully prepared for my stay and I had an incredibly comfortable time. Loved the space and it was in an amazing location! Tiffany was also very responsive which was great.
6741968,42566367,2015-08-14,314054,Praveen,What an amazing location/loft. Tiffany was a terrific host. Everything was so well organized/clean with small things like toothpaste that were set up for guests who forgot to bring their own. Essential food items were already in the fridge. Netflix lying in bed was an extra treat. Highly recommend and I plan on staying at Tiffany's the next time I am in Boston.
6741968,42769671,2015-08-15,40612106,Rob,"What makes this place spectacular is the accessible roof deck overlooking the State House and Boston Common.  My wife and I arrived to Boston a day early for a wedding, and needed a place to stay.  Tiffany's place fit the bill perfectly as a safe place to put our bags, and be centrally located to take on the sights in Boston.  We were only in the Apartment to sleep and shower, and while the Apartment itself is pretty cozy, we felt comfortable."
6741968,43631486,2015-08-21,7741800,Josh,"Great apartment in an ideal location for getting around Boston/Cambridge easily. Really enjoyed the rooftop terrace, and everything in the apartment was excellent. Tiffany provided lots of useful information and was readily available for any questions. Would definitely stay there again."
6741968,44188060,2015-08-24,23233491,Kav,"This apartment is in the heart of the city minutes walk from Boston common, the freedom trail, Quincy markets etc. Beautifully decorated charming apartment with eat in kitchen. The loft was a fun experience too. Don't forget to use the rooftop!!"
6741968,44662224,2015-08-28,25615123,Haobo,"Tiffany is a great and nice host. She made the place very clean and nice. We also like the design and decoration of the place very much. The location of the place is very convenient: next to Boston Common and many other attractions. Also, near public transportation. We highly recommend Tiffany's place."
6741968,45426076,2015-09-02,28746240,Jessie,Tiffany was a wonderful host! She messaged me with very clear directions to the apartment and where she left the key. Once we arrived at the apartment we saw a detailed note on the kitchen table explaining where things were and what was at our disposal during our stay. She even left a list of things to do around the Boston area. It was a great experience and we wished we could stay longer! I highly recommend Tiffany's apartment!
6741968,45596519,2015-09-04,27834622,David,Tiffany was a great host. Her place was very comfortable and perfectly located. Everything was well explained for the check in and check. We would recommend her place without hesitation.
6741968,45732741,2015-09-05,27289878,Kyle,"Our stay at Tiffany's apartment was a good one. We enjoyed the loft in the apartment; it was a cozy nook where we could rest our head. The apartment was clean, and all of the amenities were stocked. She even put a new disposable razor out for us, which was perfect, because I forgot to bring one! When I asked Tiffany for some advice on where to go, she was quick to respond with some ideas. Overall, we enjoyed staying at her place in Beacon Hill. The location of the apartment is reason enough to stay here, because it's right in the middle of everything! Fenway to the West, and North End to the East!"
6741968,46178287,2015-09-08,41279365,Christin,"Impeccable location! Walking distance from almost everything ( I did have to uber back from the arts museum after walking there and around it all day). But other than that the deck offers an amazing view and it was a very easy walk to the north end, boston common, and the shore. Tiffany was a great host who responded quickly when I didn't recognize the entrance right away. All of the information provided was detailed and thorough. I had a very lovely time!"
6741968,46588650,2015-09-12,11422176,Berta,"El apartamento de Tiffany se encuentra en una localización inmejorable, en el centro de Boston. Es un apartamento a dos alturas que resulta muy cómodo para 2 ó 3 personas (si sois 4 estaréis un poco más apretados)."
Está super bien equipado y Tiffany es una excelente anfitriona: se preocupa de que no falte de nada y está siempre disponible para responder a cualquier duda que pudiera surgir.,,,,,
Mención especial para la terraza del edificio,que dispone de una vistas preciosas de toda la ciudad.,,,,
"Sin duda recomiendo alojarse en este apartamento para disfrutar de Boston :)\"",,,,,
6741968,46957958,2015-09-14,7929023,Christian,"In short, our stay at this apartment was absolutely incredible. The apartment's location is superb and the apartment itself is fantastic. Besides location and homely surroundings, the building offer a stunning view of Boston. You could not ask for more."
Also,Tiffany was an excellent host,"responding to messages within the hour at all times. This listing and Tiffany both get the highest of recommendations. \"",,,
6741968,48280549,2015-09-25,39292184,Yolanda,Our Boston vacation was a wonderful experience.her condo has the best location.i definitely would recommend this place.tiffany stayed late and personally handed the keys to the unit.she responds to any queries thru text quickly. I would rate her place: A+
6741968,48699377,2015-09-28,31073416,Leonardo,"O apartamento é excelente e muito limpo. A Tiffany nos deixou um colchão inflável que era muito confortável para duas pessoas. A cama no mezanino também era excelente. Utilizamos o rooftop no último dia e a vista é IRADA! Localização perfeita! Tudo fica muito perto, parques, restaurantes, lojas, metrô... Recomendo para todos os viajantes. Se voltar a Boston, ficarei lá novamente com certeza!"
6741968,49020335,2015-09-30,42218620,Jordan,Best location in Boston for sure. I don't think we had over a 15 minute walk to anywhere we wanted to go. Tiffany's place was exactly as advertised. The rooftop patio was the highlight of the place day and night for us. It was easy to check in and out and my girlfriend and I had everything we needed for a very memorable trip to Boston. I highly recommend Tiffany's place to anyone who wants to be centrally located to all of downtown Boston.
6741968,49315814,2015-10-03,24649224,Emma,"Tiffany was very helpful and replied almost instantly to my messages. The apartment was also very welcoming, with little snacks, milk, coffee, etc. The apartment is adorable and it is in the best location. Four of us stayed there for one night and we were very comfortable but, for longer stays, the apartment is probably best suited to a couple. I cannot recommend this place highly enough."
6741968,49894643,2015-10-07,24044919,Arturo,"Small gem in a great, centric area. Tiffany was super responsive and attentive. Would recommend to a friend."
6741968,50004278,2015-10-08,40527495,Joel,"Fantastic stay. Great location downtown and the experience couldn't have been easier. Minutes from the blue and red lines which was perfect for where I needed to go. Apartment was clean and well taken care of, she even provided travel toothpaste and shampoo. I would certainly stay again."
6741968,50273067,2015-10-11,31525934,Caroline A Ferris,"This was our first time in Boston, and we cannot be happier with our experience.  The location is AMAZING!!  It is literally right next to everything.  Tiffany was very nice and accommodating; she responded quickly and was very helpful with getting to the apartment.  The apartment itself was clean and nice.  It is small, but it was perfect size for me and my husband for a few days.  I loved the history of the building; it really was a neat old building in a great location. The only down side was that the hot water went out our last day.  To be fair though, we were leaving and we didn't even try and ask Tiffany how to fix it or see if there was a quick solution."
6741968,50632140,2015-10-13,13126589,Marije,Cute appartement. Great location in Beacon Hill. Close to the shops and subway. Tiffany made is feel welkom by leasing a note with tips and suggestions.
6741968,50832491,2015-10-15,36882242,Maryann,Tiffany was right there and welcoming.  Nice little extras provided throughout.
6741968,51271962,2015-10-19,8200822,Marvin,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Tiffany's loft/apt.  She was very thorough with all details and instructions, I only needed to contact her for local recommendations. I can't say enough about the location, it literally a short walk away from the majority of everything we wanted to see and   essentially right next public transportation hubs, as a result, we were able to do more than we had originally planned.  All arrangements were basically seamless.  Our stay was simply amazing and I would definitely opt to stay here again and would highly recommend."
6741968,51635199,2015-10-22,1630740,Ty,"Such a great little gem of a place in an amazing location! The apartment contained all the basic amenities and then some and the whole check-in and check-out process was seamless. Although I didn't meet the host, she made herself available for any questions and/or concerns. I would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Boston."
6741968,51946293,2015-10-25,17053262,Lauren,Very convenient location. Beautiful building. Tiffany was easy to communication with and very helpful.
6741968,52077566,2015-10-26,33296056,Katherine,Tiffany's loft was accommodating and very cozy. She made everything as easy as possible for my friends and I throughout our stay. I'd definitely recommend a stay here.
6741968,52264755,2015-10-27,15076393,Cynthia,"This efficiency apartment is in a superb location, right next to the Statehouse. It's walking distance to anything in downtown Boston. Clean and cute. Easy ladder to access loft. Host was very helpful."
6741968,52482551,2015-10-30,31427233,Kate,"Cute apartment, amazing building, amazing location.  Coffee was provided along with sweeteners and creamer as well as bathroom necessities - a nice touch!"
The place was visually clean/tidy,but if there was a professional cleaner in they did not do the floors or the tub (hairs in the bottom).  Our air mattress had a slow leak,so it caused the center to sink and made for quite uncomfortable sleeping.  Tiffany was nice enough to same day us a new one,but it was a much lower height and a double (versus the queen) mattress,so we decided to go with the original air mattress anyhow.  Our friends stayed in the loft and said it was quite small but comfy enough.  They did have one night where they were woken up by a bug crawling on them (this could happen anywhere though).  Also,we tried turning on the TV downstairs and it doesn't work as it's not hooked up to anything so if you want to watch tv it's only upstairs.  No eggs were provided as the listing stated and the bagels that were left were expired and hard.  Thought maybe the milk and cereal was left instead
Lastly,don't ask if she offers discounts because when we did that the price miraculously went up on the listing.  I was still able to book 2 of the 3 nights as she had preapproved me at the initial rate,but she wouldn't respond to my questions as she was presumably hoping to rent to someone at a higher rate.  Was given BS reasons of airbnb changing the rate which airbnb clearly states that the rates are driven by the renter.  Also,we were trying to book the third night and she rented it to someone else after approving us for it and airbnb said the only way this would happen was if she had approved their rental.  Again was given a shady response in regards to this.  Just didn't feel too comfortable given these circumstances.  Would have rather had the truth up front and could have decided if we wanted to book elsewhere.  We stayed our third night at the Westin Copley square for the same exact price and had a much better experience.  Would recommend the location and the place if some of the above is corrected,but until then,I'd take the hotel or a different listing.  Hate to be negative
6741968,52820896,2015-11-02,39363103,Eric,"Tiffany's apartment was perfect for our stay in Boston. Her loft apartment is incredibly well-appointed, with plenty of amenities and cool decorations. As far as location goes, it's tough to do better. The apartment being block away from the T means it's easy to get basically anywhere, and we were also able to comfortably walk all over downtown. Tiffany herself was incredibly helpful, leaving helpful post-its all over the apartment, tips for getting the most out of our stay, and was very flexible in meeting us after a late flight. Couldn't have been happier with the stay and would recommend for anyone looking for a great base of operations for a downtown Boston visit"
6741968,52994285,2015-11-03,1401856,Orion,"Tiffany was a superb host, very accommodating and communicative. The loft was really cute and we loved the historic old building and couldn't believe its location, which is right next to the Commons in Beacon Hill. The view from the rooftop deck was world class- and the pictures on this rental's site do not do it justice. All around I highly recommend this place. I would stay here again if we return to Boston."
Also,noted that the loft bed is really cozy,"comfortable and the whole apt. had a great layout and design. The apartment has tons of old hardware if you are into vintage stuff. We really enjoyed it!\"",,,
6741968,53073725,2015-11-04,45722556,Jonny,"The view from the roof terrace is unrivalled. You will struggle to beat this. This also means the location is perfect for getting around. Parking is a bit more expensive around this area. So consider looking a bit further a field.  The house was also great, and we appreciated Tiffany's note of advise and recommendations for the city. It was no problem getting into the apartment."

6741968,54354019,2015-11-18,48904813,Leah,"This was my first time using AirBnB and visiting Boston. I finally chose Tiffany's beautiful loft after searching and reviewing tons of other listings for the downtown location, amazing rooftop view and awesome host reviews. She reached out to me and gave great recommendations for the trip. I had no problems checking in or throughout my stay. I loved that she offered travel toiletries and ask to pick up some groceries before check-in too! Her apartment is unique and loved the loft style. The rooftop view is absolutely amazing at sunset! The only minor issue was the heat in the apartment is controlled by the building and it got very hot at night. I just opened the window and left the fan on to cool down."
6741968,54917456,2015-11-25,48602310,Daniel,"I had an amazing time, it was exactly what was described in the photos.  A truly beautiful place in a perfect location"
6741968,56302773,2015-12-12,30736414,Paul,"Stayed in Tiffany's lovely loft in a gorgeous and quiet neighborhood of Boston. Her place has a ton of personality and there's rooftop patio access on the 10th floor with a remarkable view. You're walking distance from everything—the Boston Commons, train station, shopping areas, movie theatre, great coffee and food."
6741968,56485445,2015-12-14,885838,Jessica,I absolutely loved staying in Tiffany's studio.  It is such a perfect location and was (for such a tiny space) so comfortable and convenient.  Everything one could want in a tiny little package!
6741968,58292361,2016-01-02,28407108,Maggie,"Where to begin? Tiffany made everything PERFECT! The space itself is so gorgeous, and while we never met Tiffany, she was incredibly helpful and responsive throughout the booking process and our actual stay. This was a perfect place to celebrate the New Year! My only regret is that we never got to meet directly, because Tiffany was an incredible host and her loft is 10/10"
6741968,60147129,2016-01-19,21438424,Kevin,Great space and great location in the city! Would definitely stay here again and recommend to any one looking for a place to stay in the city. Roof top deck is also awesome!

The building is old and beautiful with a breathtaking view from the rooftop. The loft itself is very cozy and has everything one may need. Tiffany was an amazing host and although we didn't meet in person, she was always very responsive and helpful. We asked to drop-off our luggage in the morning, and not only did she let us drop the luggage, Tiffany also managed to arrange an early check-in and a late check-out, which we greatly appreciate! We highly recommend Tiffany's place and would definitely come back again."
6741968,70439265,2016-04-17,4177837,Tiffany,"Tiffany's apartment space is the perfect spot if you're staying in Boston. The location is so convenient and the apartment itself is very nice.  The loft bed is cozy and fun, it makes it seem like you are glamor camping when up in the loft.  The rest of the apartment is perfectly set up, very clean, and stocked with essentials should you need a drink or a snack or a map.  It's easy to see this space is very well cared for and that the host puts a lot of effort into making sure guests have everything they need.  For my husband and I it was a very brief stay, but should we find ourselves in Boston again we would definitely stay here again."
6741968,70680311,2016-04-19,33209868,Richard,"The listing was accurate and the host helped me feel welcome with emails in advance of my stay, and notes provided when I arrived to make everything smooth and easy."

6741968,71160029,2016-04-24,7658306,Jessica,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Tiffany's loft, it was so well situated! Just steps away from Park Street. Tiffany was highly responsive, and let us know when she was going to be out of town with limited access before she left. Just to note, if you have to get up and go to the bathroom in the middle of the night or have limited mobility, be sure that you know there is a ladder to the bedroom lofted area!"

She was my first host ever on AirbnB, and if every host is like her...I'm going to love using this app because she was fantastic.  We especially liked how she has Apple TV, we also have one at home so it was cool to continue to watch our normal shows before we went to sleep at night! Perfect location also, walking distance to pretty much everything you would like to visit while in Boston, and just a short uber or t ride away from other places surrounding the city. Thank you Tiffany!! We will be back again, hopefully next time with sunny skies and warmer weather!"

Her apartment is quaint and cozy, with quirky decorations, interesting books, and a lovely lofted bed (note to potential renters, you will have to climb a ladder to get to the bed!) Tiffany provided everything we needed for an excellent stay: basic breakfast foods, several maps of the area, towels and basic toiletries/medications, cozy blankets, etc. Her apartment is just as described: in a secure building in a safe (though busy) area, close to several T stops, and within walking distance of main \"\"tourist\"\" areas.

When we were challenged in a couple of ways,"Tiffany was immediately responsive which was very kind and helpful.\"",,,,
6741968,91349615,2016-08-05,47425445,Elizabeth,What a nice flat in a perfect location! Truly walking distance to just about any part of downtown Boston!  And a quiet place as well. Lived like a local at Tiffanys place.
6741968,91723573,2016-08-06,35377785,Jackie,I had a great visit at Tiffany's place.  It was exactly as described in the website and she was so helpful and responsive when I had questions!  Her flat is also very centrally and conveniently located.  I would highly recommend you stay with Tiffany when visiting Boston!
6741968,92830550,2016-08-10,8354891,Taryn,"Tiffany is an excellent hostess! She was able to let us drop our bags off earlier than the check in time which was so helpful. It allowed us several extra hours of being able to explore Boston without luggage! Her communication was impeccable and she was very accommodating. Her loft was so much fun. The mezzanine bedroom was such a unique twist on a studio design- truly a treat :). Did tou forget something for your stay? Don't worry- chances are, Tiffany has it stocked in her studio. Toiletries, first aid kit, cooking supplies and essentials to get you started. She has coffee and power bars to get you ready for the day. You just have to show up! The location of her studio was beyond expectation- I wish I could have given it 10 stars. Situated at the top of Boston commons in the prestigious and beautiful Beacon Hill district- you can NOT beat this location. We were able to walk almost the entirety of the Boston area from this location! You will not be disappointed if you stay here! We will recommend this location to friends and family. Thank you Tiffany for such an amazing experience- it made our Boston trip all the more awesome!"
6741968,93124795,2016-08-11,66658917,Keri,"Tiffany's place is awesome! A great location, walking distance to the waterfront, right on the freedom trail and next to Boston Common. The rooftop patio is super cool make sure to check out the view. I highly recommend staying here, felt very safe and secure. We were able to get parking right next to the building-38$ per day, very close to the T so had no trouble getting around town. Loved it!"
6741968,94128799,2016-08-14,69441827,Deanna,Tiffany was very helpful. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. This was in a great location. We enjoyed the rooftop patio available in this building.

The condo is beautiful and centrally located, easy walking through the North End, Faneuil Hall, and Boston Commons area. We would love to return!"
11624428,74794325,2016-05-16,46302609,Paola Solange,"What a wonderful experience. We spent 9 days in this lovely space. The pictures didn't do it justice. It was much bigger than anticipated. Our family flew in from California for my son's graduation and the location was perfect so that we didn't need to rent a car because everything (the North End's great Italian food, coffee, cannoli..) was a short walk away. There was also a small grocery store almost right across the street from the apartment. Trish was quick responding to my texts and questions. She was also a very gracious host and left a stocked fridge for us. Her home was tastefully decorated and very, very clean and she has many wonderful books on diverse topics. I cannot say enough about her place and its location. We would definitely love to come back and would recommend it to people who wish to stay in Boston."
11624428,75867218,2016-05-23,4508417,Bonnee,"What a lovely place to stay and spend a weekend in Boston. Trish’s apartment was clean and comfortable and you can’t beat the location. The living room faces the harbor and is in North End. The bedroom is in the back and relatively quiet for being in a city. The apartment was totally convenient to everything you need while in Boston. Trish is a perfect hostess and did everything possible to make us feel like we were in our own home. Don’t look further. If you are visiting Boston, this is where you want to stay. Thank you, Trish, for opening your home to my family and being thoughtful enough to leave us food for breakfast too."

And the location is even better. It's walking distance to great restaurants, famous bakeries, Boston harbor and major historic sites."
Trish herself was very helpful and responded promptly to messages. She left several hand written notes with directions which we found very helpful. On our request,she even set up extra daybeds to accommodate us.,,,,

Ashley was an excellent host. Communications were prompt and comprehensive and it was obvious a lot of effort was put into making the stay enjoyable and memorable.  She was very helpful and provided a lot of unprompted information to help me get the most out of my trip.,,,,,
The room itself was nicely furnished,clean and quiet. The en-suite bathroom was spotless and,like the bedroom,nicely decorated. There were a few nice touches in the room that added to the general welcoming feel of the place.,,
Definitely somewhere I will return to when I next go back to Boston.,,,,,

From the first contact,over our arrival and throughout our stay everything was taken care of. Ashley responds super fast,offers great advice and is so thoughtful! When we arrived it directly felt home-like. The beautiful room with its own bathroom was nicely arranged,a guide book was at the ready and everything we needed to know for our arrival was communicated before.,,
The room is to the back,quite,nicely equipped,and especially beautiful on a sunny day when you can let the air flow in from the yard. We slept really well and enjoyed having our own little space :).,,
Location wise the house is directly located on the freedom trail in a beautiful and central area. You can walk to the center within 15-20 minutes,less to the North End. Sights are close by and we felt very safe at all times!,,,,
"Conclusion: we would pick Ashley's over a hotel any time. It was the best stay we have had in the course of our USA trip!\"",,,,,

We had complete privacy (own entrance and bathroom) and could come and go as we pleased. The bottle of wine, water and apple upon arrival was a really nice touch! Would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting the Boston area!"
1102623,22954844,2014-11-18,3266673,Jennifer,We had a nice stay in this bedroom and were surprised with a bottle of red wine upon arrival!
My boyfriend and I thought it to be quite smaller than we expected,and we did not know there was someone living in the next room over,which made it a bit less private for us in terms of hearing people,etc. It was pretty cold in the room as well so I am not sure if it was really heated,but we were also visiting when it was close to 0 degrees outside. Also take note there is no TV or computer to watch anything on (if you like watching some late night TV or movies!),
We didn't see the host but we were okay with that as we wanted to do our own thing and everything was taken care of/arranged before our arrival anyhow,and it was very easy to get to the house and into our room. She was very helpful with advice or tips on Boston in terms of places to go,transportation,and re,,
It is great if you are on a budget and looking to save some money but stay in Boston as it's not too far out of downtown. About 15 minutes walking to the T stop (metro/subway) to get downtown,"and in a nice little residential area. \"",,,,
1102623,23035461,2014-11-21,8629167,Tom,"Great place to stay, and Ashley and Mark could not have made it easier in terms of check in and out. Lovely little self-contained apartment in a great part of the city. Highly recommended."
1102623,28905481,2015-03-31,29622678,Dennis,"We selected Ashley's location based on proximity to our daughter and her family (a five minute walk) and it turned out to be an excellent choice.  Ashley is a conscientious host and made sure we were welcome with excellent pre-arrival communications, clear instructions, and even a bottle of wine in the room.  While the room is small it is exactly as she described and within walking distance of everything, both historical sights and shopping amenities, such as an excellent grocery store.  I'm sure we will be staying with her again on a future visit."
1102623,29933452,2015-04-14,6073676,Sergey,"Our host Ashley was very welcoming. We had a bottle of red wine awaiting upon our arrival. The listing was accurate, and in a great area. A few steps away from the Bunker Hill monument, and a 5-10 min walk from the Community College orange line T-stop and Whole Foods."

1102623,31145858,2015-05-02,4152884,Peter,"A perfect place to stay. Quiet neighborhood, yet very close to Bunker Hill monument, Charlestown Navy Yard, and a variety of restaurants. Very good access to public transit to Boston and Cambridge (or a lovely walk across the river to north station). I like a little privacy, and so I was happy that this accommodation had both independent access from a common stairway and a private bath. The bedroom is small but cozy and comfortable for two, with large windows overlooking a pretty courtyard. Well-equipped bathroom, high quality linens and towels, and a few pleasant amenities to make you feel welcome. I would definitely stay here again!"
1102623,31441771,2015-05-05,761738,Eric,Ashley was a great host.  She was in communication with us the day we arrived and was flexible to our plans.  The description was accurate.  Everything was clean in our room.  The neighborhood is fantastic!  So close to the Freedom Trail and a quick walk to the North end.

Also overall the communication was flawless. The room is exactly what is described here and what is seen on the pictures. You can have absolute privacy, since the bedroom with the bathroom has its own entrance from the common stairway in the house. The bathroom is fully equipped, and the room is generally nicely arranged. The neighbourhood is in very interesting old part of the city, and there is good amount of food possibilities (of any type from breakfast to dining). This was our first AirB&B experience, and I can hardly imagine how it could be more perfect. Highly recommended."

1102623,37856457,2015-07-11,33530849,Chris,We really enjoyed the location! It is right beside so many great historical sites and is not too far from the Transit. The hosts were ery informative and gave us great suggestions for places to eat and see and were very attentive to any of our needs. The only issue we experienced was that the room was warm in July (of course) and we wanted to resort to opening the windows but one didn't open and the other didn't have a screen so bugs came in. We would still suggest staying here as it is fantastic for someone who wants to spend the day sight seeing!

We loved being right on the Freedom Trail and right across the street from the Bunker Hill monument.  We used the public transportation system (the T) for all of our trips around the city.  The bus stop at Bunker Hill and Ferrin (or Lexington,depending which way you are going) is very convenient.  The room on the 3rd floor was exactly as described.  The bed was comfortable, bathroom was big and adjacent to the room, a fan kept us cool at night and Ashley was just downstairs had we needed anything!  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!!"

Upon booking,Ashley provided honest and helpful tips for the city and for dining in the area/city. We'd recommend the clam chowder at the Warren Tavern (5 minute walk).,,,,
Ashley was great at communicatin with us where necessary and the whole process was made simple.,,,,,
For transport,I'd recommend walking over the bridge into Boston,it's closer than it looks. There is a T station close by - we preferred this walk to the walk towards the other close option,"the T at the community college.\"",,

As the hosts are downstairs it is like being in a separate mini-flat.

Από την πρώτη στιγμή της επικοινωνίας μας φρόντισε να μου παρέχει με κάθε λεπτομέρεια, όλες τις απαραίτητες πληροφορίες καθώς επίσης απαντούσε άμεσα σε κάθε μου ερώτηση. Λίγες μέρες πριν την άφιξη μου, μου έστειλε αναλυτικά κάθε δυνατή πληροφορία από το πώς θα φτάσω από το αεροδρόμιο στο σπίτι, μέχρι το που μπορώ να φάω σε ολόκληρη την πόλη. Ήταν πολύ διακριτική αλλά και πάντα διαθεσιμή σε ό,τι θα μπορούσα να χρειαστώ καθόλη τη διάρκεια της διαμονής μου εκεί. Το δωμάτιο είναι ακριβώς όπως φαίνεται στις φωτογραφίες, μικρό αλλά πολύ φωτεινό, άνετο και καθαρό. Το μπάνιο είναι επίσης καθαρό και ευρύχωρο με διαθέσιμα όλα τα απαραίτητα (πετσέτες, αφρόλουτρα, κλπ...). Από τα μεγάλα παράθυρα ο επισκέπτης μπορεί να θαυμάσει τα υπέροχα ψηλά δέντρα. Η γειτονιά είναι πολύ όμορφη, με δέντρα και πάρκα, ήσυχη και ασφαλής. Το κέντρο της πόλης είναι εύκολα προσβάσιμο με το μετρό (12-15 λεπτά περπάτημα) αλλά υπήρχει και λεωφορίο αλλά εγώ προτίμησα να χρησιμοποιήσω το μετρό. Επίσης είναι πολύ κοντά στο NavyYard, ένα υπέροχο παραθαλάσσιο μέρος που μπορεί κανείς να περπατήσει κοντά στη θάλασσα και να κάνει βόλτά αλλά και να φάει στο εστιατόριο που έχει κοντά (εξαιρετικό φαγητό-καλές τιμές-απίστευτη θέα). Γενικά η διαμονή μου εκεί ήταν μια πολύ ευχάριστη εμπειρία. H Βοστώνη είναι μία υπέροχη πόλη που αξίζει κανείς να επισκεφτεί. Συστήνω ανεπιφύλακτα το σπίτι, την περιοχή και την Ahley ως οικοδεσπότη. Προσωπικά, όταν επιστρέψω στη Βοστώνη, θα επιλέξω να μείνω στο ίδιο μέρος. Ευχαριστώ θερμά την Ahley!"

1102623,86486458,2016-07-16,48320841,Ruth,"Ashley was easy to get in touch with, good at explaining things, and very pleasant.  The space was clean, private, and quiet, the bed was comfortable.  I was going to a conference on the waterfront but it was easy (and fast, about 3-35 minutes total for train+walking door to door to Westin Boston Waterfront) to get there from nearby subway stop so I saved a lot of money not just on hotel but on local transportation. Whole Foods nearby provided all my basic coffee and food needs. The only reason I can't say much about the neighborhood, except it was safe, had cool architecture, etc, is that I was at my conference too much. My arrival night I ate at a good thai restaurant, sweetriceBoston,  which was about 7 min walk away (same as whole foods)  Anything else the Boston area you can offer is right at your disposal, again via the subway or uber."
1102623,87943231,2016-07-22,17091788,Emma,"Very nice room with your own bathroom. Nice and quiet neighborhood, right at the freedom trail. Very good restaurants in the neigborhood. Ashley gave us a lot of tips for restaurants and they were all delicious. I would recommend to use the biking system, hereby you can move very fast through the city."
1102623,90954765,2016-08-03,79027833,Nicole,"Ashley was very thoughtful and provided plenty of information to us in the lead up to our stay in Boston. The room was ideal for us, we were out sight seeing most of the time and is was a lovely residential area to come home to late at night - we felt very safe walking around. Room was clean and bed comfy - plus a pretty outlook from the window."
1102623,98092326,2016-08-29,25886159,Marie,"Ashley was a great host. She emailed us ahead of our stay with details on travel from the airport to her place, as well as lists of restaurants and grocery stores. We had traveled on a red eye to Boston so it was really appreciated to know exactly where to go when we arrived!"
Ashley was also VERY easy to communicate with via email. She was very quick to respond and assisted when we had any issues or questions immediately. The room is as described. Personally,I struggled with the comfort of the bed because it is a futon style mattress on a bed frame. It was hard for me. Although Mark ran out and bought a pillow top mattress cover to help right away. The bathroom was a good size,they also had a hair dryer and there was an iron and board.,,,
"Note that the room does not have air conditioning but there is a table top fan.\"",,,,,
3591388,16943829,2014-08-04,16396927,Bill,"This palatial one bedroom in the peaceful Back Bay is an absolute steal.  Everything was tastefully decorated, clean, and comfortable.  The kitchen came ready stocked with breakfast foods to sate any craving (i.e. cereal, coffee, bread, Nutella, peanut butter, jams, etc...).  As hosts, Aghdas and her daughter were kind and very responsive.  I truly hope this place is available the next time I swing through Boston."
3591388,17316062,2014-08-10,2841755,Indre And Gaetan,"We had a great stay in Aghdas home while searching for a long term rental in Boston. The daughter of Aghdas welcomed us with some fresh food for breakfast which was a very nice gesture after a long trip. She was extremely helpful, friendly and responsive during all of our stay."
The apartment is very well located in one of the nicest neighbourhood of Boston - Back Bay,close to downtown,shopping,restaurants... Perfect base to explore the city. The apartment itself was very clean,quiet,had high quality linens and towels
"We really enjoyed our stay. Warmly recommended!\"",,,,,
3591388,19479961,2014-09-13,20317689,James,"Aghdas made everything very easy. We received the key as soon as we got there, with no hassle. The apartment is better than described! It has a lot of character, and I didn't want to leave when it was time to go! The tree-lined street was quiet and quite beautiful, and the Back Bay neighborhood was wonderful. I was only a couple blocks from the convention center for a conference I was attending, so this apartment is perfect for anyone attending conferences there. It's also just far enough away that you don't have conference-goers walking up and down the block!"
Other notes. The bathroom and the shower are much better than they look in the pictures. The bed was very comfortable. Also,the apartment is on the first floor,so there are no stairs to climb.,,,
Overall,"I highly recommend!\"",,,,
3591388,19956070,2014-09-21,2845415,Faisal,"This is a wonderful apartment in a very nice, quiet neighborhood. I attended a conference at MIT which was walking distance across the Mass Ave bridge.  Very close to Kemnore square, the subway, Newbury Street and all the main attractions of old Boston. A perfect place to stay!"
3591388,20304417,2014-09-27,18016435,Anna + Micah,This apartment is truly lovely. It's in a great neighborhood close to everything. The setting is private and roomy. I highly recommend it.
3591388,21000965,2014-10-09,21208049,Bryan,This was a very nice apartment in a great location on one of the quietest streets in the Back Bay. The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable. There was a great shower as well. The photographs are an exact representation of the space and the furniture. No surprises.
Azita was waiting for me when I arrived and she graciously showed me where everything was and offered suggestions for local grocery stores,etc...,,,,
This was my first airbnb rental and I have to say,"after this experience I will definitely use the service again.\"",,,,
3591388,21302720,2014-10-14,5503767,Peggy,The apartment suited my needs perfectly. Great location
3591388,21488670,2014-10-18,12813604,Sermin,"Aghdas's place was beautiful. The place was fully equiped and clean in a very nice street and neighbourhood. The location is fantastic with everything in walking distance. Communication and check in was very easy. Aghdas was away but her daughter was very helpful, down to earth and kind. She even brought her sons books for our 9 month old baby, which he loved. I would definitly recommend this place and would come back to stay here again. It was a shame we couldnt stay longer. Aghdas daughter also has 4 restaurants which we only tried one of. The restaurant was located at Beacon Hill - 20min walk. It was  persian cuisine and the food was deliciouse."
3591388,21813022,2014-10-24,17042932,Timothy,"Best stay so far.  Great and enjoyable pre stay communications, wonderful place, in a wonderful neighborhood hosted by a wonderful person."
Place is super sharp,well appointed and I loved the big comfy bed.,,,,

Highly recommended.,,,,,

3591388,22083673,2014-10-29,19517745,Darby,"Great location and large space in the Back Bay.  Aghdas was welcoming and provided breakfast foods (granola, milk, OJ, butter, fresh apples) for my stay. The apartment was even better than imagined. Comfortable beds and couches.  Easy walking distance to great restaurants and all the sights of Boston.  Thank you!"
3591388,22644329,2014-11-11,8601629,Miriam,I had a wonderful stay in this apartment
I have travelled to boston many times for conferences and this time I felt like I was living there,rather than the in transit feelings that big hotels leave you with,,,,
Aghdas was so easy to contact about nothing I needed and the welcoming supply of coffee and breakfast things on the first day great,,,,,
The bed very comfortable sheets top quality and weather great too,,,,,
I will stay there again hope it's available next time!,,,,,

3591388,32625465,2015-05-19,1796898,Mel,My co-worker Evert stayed at this location. He had this to say.
This place is a great example of what its like to stay locally in Boston. If the street isn’t impressive enough,the building certainly is. It was nice walking home everyday along the rows of brownstones. The apartment had lots of room and all comforts of home. Everything was clean,"and they even left me fresh towels. Very friendly as well.\"",,,
3591388,34878057,2015-06-13,33155682,Zhenhai,"I had a great experience in this apartment. It is very clean and elegantly decorated. It is only 3 blocks away from the Hynes Convention Center. The neighborhood is very quiet and is close to parks and many grocery stores such as Whole Food, Star Market and Trader Joe."
Aghdas kindly walked me through the apartment when I arrived around 10PM on a Saturday. I will definitely come back next time I visit Boston.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3591388,38563113,2015-07-16,2423825,Leonardo,Great location and excellent apartment. I would go back for sure. Thank you!
3591388,45489746,2015-09-03,13525816,Brent,I had a great stay at the Backbay apartment and Aghdas made sure everything was in good shape and quickly handled a couple of questions I had.
3591388,46631560,2015-09-12,40575748,Kate,"This apartment was perfect! So Bostonian and such a fabulous neighborhood! Aghdas wasn't home when we were in town, but her daughter looked after us, and gave us some top tips on Boston! We had a fabulous stay, thank you!"
3591388,47358804,2015-09-18,17099805,Phil,"Azita (sorry if I spelt that wrong) was on hand and always available by phone. This was a fine location, a really nice street minutes walk from the convention centre, stone throw from a lovely river walk, and next block is Newbury Street. That means really nice high end eateries and shops all the way into City Centre. Proper kitchen, no washing machine but that is no problem as there is a laundry 100 yards away with a one hour wash and fold service. Good local corner stores too. I (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)d the cost of hotels nearby: double the cost for a room, which what makes airbnb what it is! Our only criticism would be that the bed is not the most comfortable we have stayed in. Overall, great spot!"
3591388,48437131,2015-09-26,23305938,Colene,She was there to meet us even though we were early and showed us around and made us feel welcome.
3591388,49109288,2015-10-01,8818623,Debbie,"Wonderful apartment in a great area. Close to restaurants, shops, the green line but on a quiet residential street. Aghdas and her daughter were great, very responsive."
3591388,49856305,2015-10-06,1919944,Beth,"Aghdas was incredibly responsive to our e mails and delightful to work with in booking her unit. The photos are accurate and the unit is lovely and comfortable. The location is the best in Boston, a quiet street walking distance to everything Boston has to offer. There is a full working kitchen, but there are so many fabulous restaurants in Boston we did not cook. The bed and sheets were very comfortable and we slept very well. The morning sun comes streaming into the bedroom to start the day. This unit will be our first choice to stay in Boston every time."
3591388,50317273,2015-10-11,43682853,Julia,My host made me feel very welcome and even offered to drive me from the airport as she had just dropped off her husband which was extremely kind of her. The apartment was as described and the neighbourhood was truly delightful with many properties putting their decorations out for Halloween. It was a very relaxing and enjoyable stay overall and for me far nicer than the hustle of a hotel.
3591388,51320721,2015-10-19,1386771,Adrian,"Aghdas' apartment was an excellent place to stay. The apartment is clean, well-appointed, and comfortable. The location in the Back Bay could not be any better. Thank you for being such a great and communicative host!"
3591388,52427368,2015-10-29,14965759,Christian,This is a perfect place if you are interested in staying in the Back Bay area when visiting Boston or if you are in town for a convention at the Hynes Center. The neighborhood is great and just a short walk to Newberry street. The flat was comfortable and appropriately sized for me as a single occupant but would be just as comfortable if I was with my spouse.
3591388,53203227,2015-11-06,38472831,Graham,"Perfect location, very comfortable and my host was extremely helpful. I would happily stay here again if its available on my next visit to Boston."
3591388,76171424,2016-05-25,1919944,Beth,"This is the second time that I have stayed here and both experiences were excellent! It is a lovely home located in one of the nicest areas of Boston's Back Bay, close to everything. My hostess greeted me upon arrival and the home was clean and ready for my arrival."
3591388,82833666,2016-06-29,28284150,William,"Aghdas had her daughter Azita who also lives in the building provide the key and tour of the apartment. She was readily available to come down to assist us in getting the door to the apartment to lock (required lifting the door up slightly), getting onto the internet and providing some extra trashbags. The apartment is on a quiet street in the Back Bay close to restaurants  and shopping. The furniture and decor are well represented by the pictures, except the table is now moved into the living room allowing a small sofa to occupy the bay window. The elegant high boy in the bedroom was filled with clothes so drawer space was limited to another small dresser. But there was good space in one empty closet for hanging clothes. The kitchen was well appointed though the coffee maker is quite slow but brews effectively. There is a pleasant scent of Persian spices emanating from cupboard above the kitchen. No breakfast food provided for our visit but food shopping very close at markets on Boylston. Good central air conditioning and excellent water pressure in the shower were much appreciated. All in all we were very satisfied and may hope to come again."
3591388,87125099,2016-07-18,2214150,Benjamin,Really great apartment in a fantastic neighborhood.  Aghdas allows you your privacy but is very responsive if you need something

3591388,99348993,2016-09-04,21139304,Heather,"Great neighborhood, perfect for our needs which included moving our daughter into her dorm a block away. We had few needs, but sent a text and they questions and needs were attended to immediately.  Quiet, spacious, conveniently located near Berklee College of Music.  It was perfect."
13298014,90046011,2016-07-31,10103230,Alena,"Das Zimmer ist in einer guten Gegend von Boston, allerdings an einer großen Kreuzung gelegen. Aufgrund der dünnen Fenster ist es sehr laut und zudem noch sehr heiß, sodass es vor allem im Sommer schwierig ist zu schlafen. Das Zimmer ist sehr klein, enthält jedoch alles notwendige. Besonders schön ist die Dachterrasse (wird von den Bewohnern des ganzen Hauses genutzt). Leider ist die Wohnung an sich jedoch nicht wirklich sauber."
8469735,49060372,2015-09-30,44467029,Saiba,Bonnie was a terrific host.  I stayed at her house for about 10 days and had no complaints.  I even considered extending my stay for a couple of months had I not found an apartment.  She was always accessible and responded pretty rapidly to any questions or needs I had.  Getting to the city was pretty fast since the Blue Line stop (Orient Heights) is only about a 4 minute walk and it took roughly 12 minutes to arrive at State Street downtown.
I work pretty late hours and walked from the subway station around midnight and I never felt unsafe walking over that late.  The neighborhood is pretty safe and residents around seem pretty helpful with directions.,,,,,
Bonnie's place was kept very clean,is quite spacious and very safe.  I would absolutely stay there again without any hesitation and I plan on using it to host friends when they visit me in Boston.,,,,
Thanks,,,,,
"Bonnie \"",,,,,
8469735,49738346,2015-10-05,42490812,Karyn,"I actually never met Bonnie since she does not live in the residence...apparently. Future guests should know that the place is very spartan, though clean.  I was unable, for example, to find any silverware. It's also a bit off the beaten trail.  There were no stores in the immediate vicinity and it's a pretty hilly hike back and forth from the T station.  That said, the room was airy and large and the bed comfortable."
8469735,58004634,2015-12-31,45767073,Corwin,"I had a good time here. Bonnie is responsive and takes care of her tenants. The room is pretty big. It's a pretty quiet place, and right by the subway station. Free internet and gas stove were a bonus. It's an older house, but I've no complaints. I was here for three months."

5891012,44267382,2015-08-24,14942312,James,"It was charming to visit Paul. His accommodation is comfortable and welcoming, although modest. We all ended up cooking a dinner together - their exchange student from France and his roommate who is a non-profit lawyer - actually, Paul wasn't there for dinner! That is to say it was an enjoable place to stay."
The neighborhood is very authentic and interesting. The houses are beautiful and I trust that it is actually quite a safe area. It is a great location really. I had to problem parkng right in front.,,,,,

1425973,8145068,2013-10-17,5227497,Riette,"\"Kevin responded to my request almost immediately and it was easy to communicate with him to make arrangements.  The location of the house is very good and close to public transport and the house looks exactly like the pictures - it is indeed a beautifully restored property.  This is unfortunately all the positives I can come up with.  We arrived late in the evening and never got to meet Kevin.  Kevin's partner let us in and showed us the ropes, which included removing our shoes before walking in the house - this is made clear in the posting for the house but we missed that detail, so our fault.  She is a lovely lady but we found it quite difficult to communicate with her, which probably did not contribute to our impressions.  I was completely dismayed to find that we were sharing the house with Kevin's partner as I specifically filtered for an entire house/apartment when I searched Airbnb.  Sharing my private space is most definitely not my strong point and if I had know this, I would have rather booked into a hotel.  Our friends at least had one floor with bedroom, bathroom and kitchen to themselves.  Kevin's partner seemed very tense that we might somehow damage the property and we all felt constantly \"\"watched\"\".  For this reason we got out of the house early in the morning and came back late at night - which was not the intention.  The advertised breakfast I now realise was only intended to be cereal and in our case this came without milk - go figure.  At this point I demanded a refund for stocking our own breakfast.  We only ate breakfast at the house.  On the last night I washed a few items in the washing machine and dried it in the tumble drier"
1425973,8343325,2013-10-26,1891315,Matthew And Jon,"Kevins place was amazing. He and his partner were wonderful hosts, helpful and very nice"
1425973,8471222,2013-11-01,9485224,Juan,The house is absolutely amazing. Had a great time and Kevin was a great host. We recommend this property.
1425973,13141618,2014-05-20,11789100,Pat,"\"This Victorian row house has been meticulously restored and suited our purpose--which was a quiet family dinner for our graduating Tufts DMD--very well. The host was receptive to suggestions for smoother maneuvering around the home for future guests, and an atypical glitch with the elevator at the start should not be a problem for future guests.  Do allow time to \"\"move-in\"\" and \"\"move-out\"\" though"
This is a very special residence for that special event,one that deserves a high level of respect in return. Do thoroughly discuss expectations in advance,"and you should be good to go. \"",,,
1425973,19905047,2014-09-20,5019093,Nicole,"Kevin got in touch quickly about the availability of the room, which was great because my trip was last minute and I was having a tough time finding accommodations in Boston. The house is stunning, as you can tell from the photos. Kevin lovingly restored it himself and has added his own personal touches throughout. The room I stayed in had a comfy queen size bed and large closet. Bathroom right next door was spacious, clean and had some provisions. The whole place was immaculately clean and tidy. Location is amazing! Very close to transit, restaurants, and if you like to walk and explore, it's a great neighbourhood for that. Kevin was a great host, and a very interesting guy to talk to.

13236936,80586960,2016-06-19,34460504,Heather,There are several misleading aspects to this listing that anyone considering this place should know about.
First,I'd like to state that Jean did me a kindness by letting me stay last minute and for allowing my cat to stay there. I had an unfortunate situation with a sublease and needed a place to stay for a month. However,that being said,once conflicts arose,it was clear that Jean was in denial about the state of the place and did not take the appropriate measures to correct it. Jean has not actually been in her property for several months and has not seen the state of it. Instead,she has the two college-aged tenants there to take care of things even though they did not agree to it.
Problem 1: The minute I got there,the room smelled like body odor and nothing was clean. There was short,brown curly hair on the floor with dirt and dust. The sheets also had the same stuff on them. I was told that someone was supposed to have cleaned but apparently didn't. I suppose an unfortunate situation. I overlooked this and cleaned on my own.,,,
Problem 2: I was notified by the roommates that there is a mice problem. Two mice to be exact. I found mouse droppings in my room (which does not look like the picture,btw). When I contacted Jean,she just suggested putting peanut butter in mouse traps... no shock or apology that it was even an issue.,,,
"Problem 3: There are no \"\"nice views\"\" at this place. In fact",the only appeal to this place is its proximity to the T station. However,be warned that if  you are a girl travelling alone,you should not go outside at night. This area ((SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) it) is known for gunshots and stabbings. I heard several the two weeks I was there. Jean denied this (again,not even being in the same state) and said I must have heard fireworks. I grew up in Texas and own several guns. I know what a gunshot is and this was corroborated by the roommates. Be careful if you choose to stay here.,
Problem 4: The listing is advertised as having a washer and dryer. It is actually the worst false advertisement I have encountered. They are located in the basement of the property surrounded by dirt,filth,and general muck. It's clear the washer hose has some sort of leak so where you put your laundry in,you're standing in this gross muddy,dirt puddle. It is not sanitary or healthy in any way and she shouldn't even advertise a washer and dryer at this place.,
Look--- if you absolutely want to stay here then ok. The roommates were great. However,it is not worth the amount that's charged and you can find much better in the city in a much safer area. And if you have conflict,"don't expect Jean to deal with it at all.\"",,,
3946215,22816156,2014-11-15,10894655,Charlotte,Jason was an incredible host. Absolutely friendly and welcoming. I felt that his apartment was my home away from home. His apartment was very stylish  and clean with an awesome heating system that filled the room with a warm spring-like breeze. He was extremely knowledgable about the city making it easy to explore while I was there. Absolutely recommend him as a host and his space as a home away from home... Just minutes from downtown
3946215,23054269,2014-11-21,1978035,Patrick,"Jason was a great host and his place is really nice. Very easy to get to downtown Boston, the airport, and other points of interest. Would definitely recommend staying with Jason."
3946215,23739791,2014-12-08,13533259,Jaryd,"A very nice, clean apartment. Warm, which is not always a given in the winter. Jason was a great host, let me crash at his place last minute after a concert. Highly recommend."
3946215,25111325,2015-01-06,970960,Sean,"Jason's place is great! Very quiet and peaceful. Very convenient location. Next to two hotels, a large shopping area (with bestbuy, stop&shop, target, etc.) Next to the highway, so driving to the airport takes less than 15 minutes. Jason is also a great host. I enjoyed sharing stories with him, and even learned some valuable leadership experience from him.Jason’s place is a hidden gem in Boston. It’s definitely the highlight of my Boston’s trip. Highly recommend!"
3946215,25364894,2015-01-13,24494327,Dan,"Great location, clean and snazzy flat. Such a comfy mattress, would have been fooled into thinking it was a real bed. Jay is a top-notch guy, good Bostonian advice to give. Really nice touch to have water/ coffee available"
3946215,25563823,2015-01-19,20261863,Sunny,Awesome host super friendly.
3946215,25650864,2015-01-21,16219805,Gabe,I would reccomend anyone stay with Jason coming into Boston. It is a great place for a steal. It was in great shape. Not far from the T station about 5 minute walk to the red line.
3946215,25886670,2015-01-28,2710414,Virginia,Very nice apartment near the subway. Jason was very friendly and helpful during the snow day. It was a very short but pleasant stay in Boston :)
3946215,27285411,2015-03-01,2206785,Maria,"I stayed at Jason's apartment for a week when looking for my own place in Boston. The location is great, just 5 min walk to red line T. Due to very low temperatures outside, it was also quite fresh inside but Jason granted me a control over the thermostat and provided with many blankets. He also gave me a lot of valuable tips for settling in Boston. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for inexpensive stay in Boston."
3946215,27549912,2015-03-07,28014726,William,"Very helpful, nice location"
3946215,27708323,2015-03-09,8105517,Trent,"Jason was an awesome host. He met me at the door, showed me my room, poured me a drink and we chatted for a good hour or two. Lovely guy! He went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable. The listing is accurate and the room is perfectly simple; a comfy air mattress on the floor with a table and coat rack. Perfect for those of us who just need a place to lay your head at night. For the price, hospitality, location and ease of transaction, I'd stay here again anytime."
3946215,27751907,2015-03-10,21011440,Caitlin,"Jason was very communicative and welcoming.  He coordinated my check-in via messages and was very helpful in all my interactions with him.  The room is exactly as advertised - simple and exactly what you need for a place to stay.  Even though I arrived fairly late at night and he had to be up for work extemely early, he was very friendly and chatted with me when I arrived.  I would stay again!"
3946215,27866269,2015-03-13,18607361,Frank (And Meridith),"Quick air mattress to crash on near Andrews, just two stops from South Station."
3946215,27910193,2015-03-14,10799922,Andrew,"Jason was great, helping me find the place giving me a good orientation to the area."
3946215,28325904,2015-03-22,12203797,Patrick,"Welcomed me when i arrived, everything was exactly as stated. The air mattress was very sturdy. Wasn't much around except to sleep there but the location is very convenient, only a 5 minute walk to Andrew Square station."
3946215,28994862,2015-04-02,28193835,Mufaddal,"Jason is an excellent host! Great company and very helpful. The place is exactly as described, simple and sufficient. Walking distance to a redline train station and there are lots of places to eat close by. Security is also well accounted for, I was never concerned leaving personal stuff in my room."
3946215,29698486,2015-04-11,19872207,Seungmin,"It was my first airbnb trip. I was totally satisfied with his house. He's very awsome and kind and he replied right away to all of my requests. The house has very good advantage in location, very clean and calm. I'll visit again when Boston's weather would be fine ;-) Thanks Jason."
3946215,29808090,2015-04-12,19748389,Vishal,Very clean neat and spot on
All amenities available,,,,,
Clean sheets - crisp towel,,,,,
"Fantastic value \"",,,,,
3946215,30232757,2015-04-19,30119979,Tomas,Jason is very good guy and excellent host. He was waiting for me and gave me all needed information. The room was perfect and there was also the possibility to use shared kitchen and nice living room with TV and Boston's guide books...
3946215,30343541,2015-04-20,30531002,James,Jason was great. I stayed over just for a night during the Boston Marathon weekend (I ran the Marathon) - short stay but everything was great. Will definitely see Jason's availability next time I run Boston.
3946215,30433657,2015-04-21,31145919,Josh,The host made me feel very welcome. I had just run the Boston marathon and was planning on taking a taxi down there to not have to fumble with an unfamiliar subway ride but it was super easy to find and close to the station. The apartment is nice and Jason was very accommodating. Felt right at home.
3946215,31455835,2015-05-05,2767430,Sheryl,Jason's place was awesome. A very accommodating host who allowed me to have a flexible check in time which was pretty late. He provided bottled drinking water which is an asset if you wish to walk around Boston. The apartment is conveniently located near the train station to get to anywhere easily. And the apartment is very clean which is much appreciated. Will definitely return if I'm in Boston again.
3946215,32263169,2015-05-16,27757376,Wayne,"First and foremost, I'd stay here again. It's cheap, clean and close to public transportation. Jason is a very affable, and tries to make things right. The place is located in a largely residential, not particularly scenic, neighborhood in South Boston. He lives on a third-floor row-house apartment. You'll have to haul your luggage up (and down) a narrow flight of stairs. It's ideal for a single night. I stayed for three. I suggested to Jason that he get the air-mattress off the floor. I'm not particularly fond of air-mattresses. I realized too late that there was a little machine available to re-inflate it. I also suggested a chair to sit down, and Jason seemed receptive to my suggestions. The room has a table and a place to hang clothes. For the most part, you get the apartment to yourself. But there is plenty to see in Boston, and what's the point of staying in. Overall I was pleased. There were no major unpleasant surprises. Like I said, I'd stay here again."
3946215,33151145,2015-05-25,17261689,Jeffrey,"I had a great time staying at Jason's place. He's a great host. He made me feel comfortable and he's fun to talk with. The place is just a train away from Downtown, MIT and Harvard. If I am going to visit Boston again, I would definitely choose his place again."
3946215,33538877,2015-05-29,31531866,Sergio,"the accomodation was as described, nothing more or less. nevertheless the cleanliness is something that has to be mentioned positively. and jason was a wonderful host: i didn't sleep well the first night because of the heat (top floor apartment in three-story house), but at the very next day jason bought an air-conditioning for my room... perfect! absolute to recommend."
3946215,34260286,2015-06-06,34783302,Erik,"Great host, great place and convenient location! Exactly as described and more! Thanks Jason and safe travel Cheers"
3946215,34568137,2015-06-09,22356107,David,"This was my first time using airbnb, and Jason made it a pleasurable experience. The room was exactly as described, at an excellent price, but I particularly appreciated small extra touches and the close communication that Jason provided. If this is how every airbnb experience is, then I'll be a long-time customer! One small note: there was noisy construction nearby, but it only started after about 10am."
3946215,34744363,2015-06-11,34240429,Marissa,Jason's place was great! Everything I needed/expected.
3946215,35022568,2015-06-14,24967575,Nino,Everything was perfect and as described! Underground is nearby which is also very nice!
Would definitelly recomend it to anyone coming in Boston!,,,,,

3946215,35316324,2015-06-17,33532150,Blake,"Easy, clean, and friendly. Excellent host with good communication and clear directions. Would for sure stay there again. Also a bonus that apartment is short walk to train, target and a grocery store."
3946215,36329987,2015-06-27,35868480,John,Great place and great location near the Andrew T station. The place is also located near a shopping plaza with Target and other stores nearby. Met Jason  during the check-in day briefly. Stayed here for four nights to run errands and explore the city. Place is clean and modern and the room is simply with AC. Overall great experience. Would stay here again. Thanks Jason!
3946215,36637324,2015-06-29,17175021,Shane,"The communication was excellent! I was expecting to come in late and Jason had everything set up for me to check in. It was exactly as described, simple and comfy with drinks in the fridge."
We met briefly as I was only there for 2 nights but he was really nice and helpful. He had the room set up with everything a helpful list of everything to do. The train was only a few minutes away and took me everywhere. Since it wasn't far from Downtown as well,"cab rides were not expensive at night.\"",,,,
3946215,37023608,2015-07-03,498376,Paolo,"Jason was a gracious host. He was at home when I arrived (earlier than what was listed on the room page) and he made sure I had everything I needed to be comfortable there. The room looks exactly like shown in the picture: air mattress + pump, clothes stand, one desk -- plus A/C, a coupon for Uber discounts, towels and umbrella."
I never got to use the Uber discount :-) the apartment is close to a subway station that makes transportation to and from downtown Boston very easy during the day.,,,,,
I also enjoyed some late night conversation with him when he and the other room's guest were home.,,,,,
All in all,if you are not going to Boston for a fancy room,"I definitely recommend it!\"",,,
3946215,38314368,2015-07-14,36435580,Christina,"In term of feeling welcome I can say that Jason answered all my questions and my request.  The only request was that the air mattress should be fully inflated, as the first night my hip and shoulder where literary touching the floor.  I was expecting him to monitor the mattress as it seem it was damage and leaking air but it did not happened and it was semi deflated again by the third night.  The area was very isolated and I did not feel safe walking by myself at night. He acknowledge that the area looks shady and that he ”never had a problem with anybody while living in the neighborhood”.  This was written down on a welcome framed letter that he placed in the room."
Even though I never say him,apparently when he stopped by the apartment on my last day and he used the bathroom and left behind a semi open bathroom window.  This window it’s foggy as it’s almost the same level of the next-door neighbor apartment. I had the bad experience that his neighbored was waiting for me to get naked while I was in the bathroom ready to take a shower.  I saw the guys face as he turn around and started running when he realized that I saw him.  Very irresponsible on Jason’s behave,this windows are almost right next to each other.,,,
I would certainly do not recommend it as a place to stay,certainly if you are a woman.  I strongly recommend Airbnb to take him of their list.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3946215,38575839,2015-07-16,34211360,Nicola,"Jason has been really kind, even though  I didn't meet him at the arrival he provides everything and  than we meet the day after. He is a really nice person."
3946215,38801648,2015-07-18,38593492,Sergio,Jason fue un anfitrión genial y fue muy flexible con mi itinerario. El cuarto era cómodo y tenía lo necesario tal como Jason lo anunció. Sin duda me volvería a quedar ahí.
3946215,39339866,2015-07-22,14582425,Sabrina,"Staying with Jason was awesome. I felt very welcome and we had very nice chats throughout my stay.The room was exactly as described, simple but all you need, very clean, conveniently located with good access to the red line. One of my best airbnb experiences so far."
3946215,39713467,2015-07-25,38593492,Sergio,I'd previously stayed with Jason and he was as reliable and professional as the first time. I highly recommend his listing.
3946215,40346209,2015-07-30,36669431,Ruixuan,The cozy room made for a great Boston experience.  Jason always answered my questions quickly and was very helpful :)
3946215,40496588,2015-07-31,18126132,Kaela,"I had the incredible luck of being hosted by Jason, especially on short notice. Within minutes of walking through the door, I felt at home, and knew that I made a new friend. Jason has a very outgoing personality, which was welcomed after having spent several days traveling alone. That said, I had a lot of privacy and was able to relax as well."
Jason's apartment is very comfortable,and the neighborhood is extremely convenient to navigate,with a T stop only a few blocks away. I also visited the Target,that is within walking distance,to pick up travel essentials that I forgot to pack.,
I look forward booking again with Jason in the future,"and recommend his apartment for your travels as well! \"",,,,
3946215,40856390,2015-08-02,8106398,Jorge,Un sitio perfecto para gente que quiera ir de turismo por Boston. Cerca del centro. Bien comunidado. El lugar tiene de todo y es muy cómodo y Jason muy servicial y agradable. Mi estancia fue perfecta allí.

3946215,44488448,2015-08-26,41200921,Philip,"Simple, spacious room in a great apartment that's close to the T station. Jason is very friendly and responds quickly. Just note you may have to share the bathroom with another guest. Would definitely stay again if I'm back in Boston!"
3946215,44737513,2015-08-28,7060702,Gilles,Merci à Jason pour son accueil. Il a été très accueillant et très sympathique. Ces deux jours dans cette zone de Boston que je ne connaissais pas ont été très agréables. A coup sur une adresse à recommander pour les petits budgets ;-)
3946215,46176318,2015-09-08,6126407,Patrick,"Jason was a great host, he's an avid traveller so you may well have lots to talk about. He did his best to offer local advice when requested. Communication was simple and efficient - he facilitated my later arrival with no issue. The room is as described, with decent floor space."
3946215,47498998,2015-09-19,32848686,Jason,"Staying in Jason's apartment was a really great experience, especially since it was my first Airbnb booking. Jason provided timely information on how to access the keys to the apartment and where I could find everything that I needed (towels, washcloths, room location, refreshments, etc.). Unfortunately, Jason's schedule and my itinerary never actually crossed, so we did not get the chance to meet, however he always responded quickly if I needed to get in touch with him."
The room itself was clean and there was a window AC unit that really did a great job keeping the room cool. Which,now that I think about it,I think I forgot to turn off when I left. Sorry,Jason! The bathroom was also very clean and had everything I needed.,,
As one other reviewer had mentioned,I did end up having to share the bathroom with a couple that booked the other room,but it really was no issue whatsoever.,,,
Overall,I would highly recommend booking with Jason on your trip to Boston. His apartment is incredibly accessible to just about anything you want to do or where you want to go,he has a very nice and clean apartment and,despite not actually meeting him,was a very gracious host.,
**Please note that my not meeting Jason was very much on my end and not his. My itinerary had me leaving early and coming back very late. In light of that,"he was still very accommodating and kept in touch with me.**\"",,,,

"\"",,,,,
3946215,49571556,2015-10-04,10158699,Tryggvi,A great place to stay when traveling alone for a few days. You can lock your room and have access to a kitchen and a bath. A train station (Andrew)  is not too far away which takes you straight to the center. Jason provided information quickly when asked and was very helpful.
3946215,50339557,2015-10-11,44030331,Adam,"Jason was busy the night that I came in, but he kept an open line of communication for me to access the key to get into the space.  He did meet up with me a couple of nights later and we had a quaint chat.  Friendly guy, very accommodating."
The room is pretty much as photographed although there was an extra clothing rack for us to hang our clothes,so that was a nice added bonus.  Shampoo/conditioner provided in the restroom so that was convenient.,,,,
As for the neighborhood,it's not bad if you stick to the main street.  My first night,my GPS took me down this alley way from the bus station to get to Jason's place.  It was a little creepy,but after that,it wasn't bad if I stuck on the main street.,
"The house is located on the edge of South Boston and Dorchester which is considered \"\"far\"\" in Boston/Cambridge","but I'm from TX so it wasn't bad at all.  The subway came frequent enough and the station was minutes walk from the house so it was convenient for me to access Harvard and MIT.  \"",,,,
3946215,50995615,2015-10-16,36789796,Kyeong-Hoon,"The apartment was nice and clean. The room was very basic. And it's neighborhood was quiet and safe. The best thing I think of is the location. Very near to the downtown. Easy to go anywhere in and around Boston. Surprisingly, I didn't meet Jason though I spent three nights and he was not away :-) But there were no communication problems. He was very willing to help."
3946215,51085267,2015-10-17,17053932,Deborah,"Jason was a wonderful host. He was timely with his communication and welcoming when I arrived. We only got to chat briefly, but he is very attentive and strives to make his guests feel at home and welcomed. His place is located close to the colleges, Fenway, and major city attractions. If I am in Boston again, I would stay at Jason's place."
3946215,52441389,2015-10-29,24705224,Martha,Had an amazing time. As I arrive I meet Jason soon after and we had a drink and he made me feel so comfortable. I will orally come back. It was my first time sleeping on an air mattress and it was comfortable and the room was a good space. Very quiet and the location was perfect. Used Uber the WHOLE time and no matter where I wanted to go it was always 15min or less away so perfect location. Jason gave me good places to check.
Perfect host!!,,,,,

I really appreciated for that. His place is very neat and cozy. It's closed to T, which is easy to get to downtown or any other places. Highly recommended!"
3946215,59108381,2016-01-06,39474011,Elana,Jason was an amazing host. He is very familiar with the city and he gave me a variety of places to visit if you're new in town. His place is super clean and the apartment style building was very quiet.

The location was perfectly central, as it never cost me more than $7/8 uberx ride to get anywhere I needed to go ($5/6 or less with uberpool). The room was exactly as described, warm, and comfortable. I wish I had stayed a few more days, but I'll definitely be going back next year."

3946215,75168014,2016-05-19,36127736,Stephanie,"Jason was one of the best hosts I've had while using Air Bnb. He was very nice and helpful and was easy to reach if I needed anything. The room looks exactly how it does in the picture. It's easy to get around, the subway is a couple minutes walking distance and downtown was 10-15 minutes away.  Would definitely stay here again if I ever came back to Boston!"
3946215,75855841,2016-05-23,19194567,Fatemeh,I enjoyed my stay in Jason's place. Two days before my trip a friend asked me to join and I just asked Jason if there is any possibility for both of us to stay in his place. I just asked and he very openly made it happen with the least possible cost.
And we were getting late into his place,again he organized everything in the best possible way so we did not have any stress or issue to get in.,,,,
The booklet he left us in our room was very useful and he is a charming person,talking to him was pleasant.,,,,
"Thank you Jason :)\"",,,,,
3946215,76177235,2016-05-25,72760498,Gabriel,"Jason messaged me a couple of days before my check in with questions of my arrival and suggestions of places I could visit once I was outside the apartment. He was very flexible with my travel changes as my flights got delayed. Very understanding and resourceful, the room was exactly what I needed: a place to sleep. In all its simplicity, you could still feel some of Jason's character in the apartment, mostly in the kitchen. I would strongly recommend Jason to anyone, he replies quickly and is good with recommendations. Truly made my interview process much more manageable for there was no stress about my rooming situation."
3946215,76388174,2016-05-27,4307145,Kofi,Just what I needed
3946215,77301146,2016-05-31,71369075,Brittany,"I had a very pleasant stay at Jasons. The room was clean and comfortable. Jason has done a lot to make his place feel welcoming and has done a lot to accommodate his guest. Public transit is close by and you really feel as though you are living in South Boston, which was pretty cool. I will highly recommend Jason's place to Boston visitors."
3946215,78724062,2016-06-08,3423301,Dave,"This was the perfect rental for me... Jason was AWESOME, understanding and just a great host.  I don't know how he keeps it so personable when he has lots of guests coming and going.  Location was great as well, bc I was only 10-15 minutes away from anything in Dorchester or South Boston, with lots of resources nearby for business needs.  5 stars for sure."
3946215,79236689,2016-06-12,73205314,Frances,"Incredibly hospitable host, always happy to give advise on the area. The accommodation was exactly as described and what I needed. A great place to stay! All the thumbs up!"

Jason was extremely welcoming and  was on hand with any queries that I had about the room and where to find items and information about travelling around Boston. The apartment and the room is excellent and if I am in Boston again I will book with Jason. I thoroughly recommend this listing to anyone who is staying in Boston, you won't regret it!"
3946215,82046185,2016-06-26,43225275,Matteo,"Jason communicated very clearly before my arrival. The house is in a nice neighborhood and it's a 5 minute walk from a subway stop (Andrews, red line). The apartment is very nicely decorated and the room looks exactly like it does in the pictures - simple and clean. The air mattress was also quite comfy."
Overall a great place,"would totally go back!\"",,,,
3946215,82605453,2016-06-28,44032160,Robin,Jason was a perfect airbnb host. He set up everything like it would be a hotel. He even had a welcome drink for me! All the rooms were super clean. His apartment is nice and well equipped. Jason always responded immediatly when I had any questions.
You have easy access to the red line train to downtown,"Harvard and some other destinations. There are also some bars and restaurants pretty near Jason's place. I definitely recommend staying here!\"",,,,

3946215,83687191,2016-07-03,47659108,Joseph,Jason is a great friendly host. You literally feel that you know him from a long time ago. He gives you your private space and yet he is available whenever you need to ask a question.
His place is very clean.,,,,,
The great thing is that I was able to leave my stuff after I checked out in the morning,"because my flight was later on in the evening.\"",,,,
3946215,83834097,2016-07-04,26132903,C,"Just a couple of stops from the main train station, Jason's apartment is centrally located and convenient for travelers. It's truly an oasis in the city. Although I did not see Jason, he was very helpful over email, and I did meet his friend who was very courteous and accommodating.  Definitely recommend this spot for anyone wanting to stay in a beautiful apartment near everything in the city."
3946215,84467234,2016-07-07,71925368,Xabier,"Nice place to stay, very clean, and cozy. Good location. I didn't meet Jason, since I arrived late, but he is always at the other end of the phone or e-mail, eager to help."

My flight came in earlier than 3 and he was very accommodating in letting me drop my luggage off while I hit the city.  He also had great suggestions on where to go, and methods on how to get there! He even provides codes for discounts and free rides if you don't want to take the Tram! Would definitely stay again!"

3946215,92870891,2016-08-10,73704677,Anna,"Jason is a great host with a nice, calm appartment just 5 minutes walk away from the Red Line stop. The place if perfect for single travelers. The bed, albeit an air matrace is comfortable, the sheets were clean. The AC in the room is cooling down the room properly, even if only turned on for 5 minutes. I very much enjoyed my stay. Thank you very much!"
3946215,92883496,2016-08-10,33160815,Chelsea,Space was just as described. Easy check-in... Very friendly and welcoming host :)

The host,Jason,was in communication all the time,helped me a lot to accomodate my travel plans,"and made sure everything was ok.\"",
3946215,93769890,2016-08-13,57401602,Benjamin,"The location of the apartment was good, you just walk 5 minutes to the Andrew-station. Jason answered very fast and gave me helpful advices. The apartment was very clean and the wifi was fast."

Loved the check in kit and :)  Easy 7 minute walk to the train which, easy uber to other places.  Super fast communication!  A sparse room but I honestly just used it to sleep/shower and couldn't be happier with my experience.  Waterbottles and toothbrush were nice touches. Thank you Jason!"
3946215,95142782,2016-08-18,39291956,Jake,"I came on a very late flight, but Jason was so accommodating! Check-in was a snap, even though he wasn't there.

Defintely would stay again."

When I got to his home, you couldn't help but notice how clean and organized everything was and there was even complimentary toiletries next to the page of tips Jason setup on his own. Jason was very considerate and he even showed me around the neighborhood when he had time from work. Overall, Jason is a cool guy I was glad to meet who appreciates and respects his guests dearly."
The room itself was very spacious and clean. The air mattress was comfortable,"and there's an a/c unit right in the window across from the bed. The room also has a place to hang up clothes and nice office desk for getting work done.\"",,,,
3967611,19892625,2014-09-20,20738502,Tim,"I could not possibly be happier with our stay or our hosts. The condo was perfect and the location was amazing. Arielle & Lucas were very accommodating and flexible, even we arrived several hours later than expected. Would love to have made use of the great bikes they left us, but we brought our 10 month old who isn't quite ready to ride on the handlebars yet..."
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I was skeptical about airbnb,but not anymore. Thanks,"A&L! \"",,,
3967611,20109622,2014-09-23,20914567,Luke,"What a great apartment! The neighbor is perfect for visiting Boston- nice and close to lots of activities. The bikes were fun, and the place is cute and has an awesome roof top deck. Arielle and Lucas were prompt and helpful. Great experience."
3967611,21783119,2014-10-24,3538712,Christian,"A great apartment within a great location. Good restaurants, grocery stores and the city centre can be reached within a short walk. And the rooftop will provide you with a nice city view."
Although Arielle & Lucas were on vacation,they responded to every question friendly and quickly.,,,,
"We had a pleasant stay and would come back. \"",,,,,
3967611,33009141,2015-05-24,523652,Kristin,Arielle and Lucas' apartment is in such a great location! Able to walk most places if you've got your walkin' shoes on but also close to T stations. The building is very quiet and everyone we ran into was very friendly. The deck has an incredible view.  Very comfortable accommodations and spacious place.   Probably the only negative thing was a bit of difficulty getting the lock open on the door.
1106555,4819813,2013-05-27,5849856,Nicole,"Ed is such a hospitable host. His knowledge of the city and all the must sees/must eats is invaluable when you're in Boston for only a short while. He was just a message away if I had a specific question or needed a recommendation. The duplex was perfect for my husband and I and our two friends. It was right next to the 43 bus that took us to Boston Common and the subway. We also rented the parking space he had available for another friend driving in from Philadelphia. If we ever find ourselves in Boston again we will certainly look Ed up! I can't wait to see how his new space above the duplex turns out. I want to see pictures with that 22 foot Christmas tree, Ed : )"
1106555,5275995,2013-06-22,4744744,Brigitte,Le parking a été très utile lors de notre séjour. Recommandé à de bons conducteurs car la ruelle pour s'y rendre est tout de même très étroite et difficile d'accès. Mais avec un bon conducteur comme Martin nous n'avons pas eu de problème :)
1106555,5586400,2013-07-07,5765979,Elif Damla,It was a marvelous airbnb experience. I strongly recommend everybody to see lively Boston with benefits of South end living style in this house.
We were 4 adults and 1 child at age 5 and stayed 16 days. Edward is wonderful person who is helpful and patient in every kind of situation. We are all thankful for lovely sun flowers,delicious cheses,breads,fruits,coffee,milk and variety of marmalades ready for us before we artive.
House is well decorated for especially quality-simple style lovers.,,,,,
House and all amenities were enough for us snd i strongly recommend back garden terrace with full of bird voices:),,,,,
South end is great area in boston who wants to be close city center and really no need to drive car for this place. Back bay station,symphony metro stops are close to home. There is 24 h open market across the street and of course starbucks is at the corner:),,,,
For long stay we found everything at home,well devorated living room and kitchen forced us how we can cook better:). For children house is safe and around there are lots of playing grounds.,,,,
Bedrooms were also confortable and we again understood  what a good selection ac including house at summer term in Boston.,,,,,
Apple tv and wifi were great. Especially we appreciate all books in our bedroom and cd collection.,,,,,
These all is the success of Edward,"we hope to be in there next year.\"",,,,
1106555,11821556,2014-04-15,9796150,Nick,"This parking spot is absolutely recommended. It is significantly less expensive than the parking garages, which are also not very close. In addition, due to the nightmarish quality of driving and parking throughout Boston, keeping your car here will ensure its safety and your peace of mind."
1106555,14382288,2014-06-17,16667063,Kelly,Edward was great and very accomodating. We had to drop our bags off early to go to a Red Sox game and it was no big deal at all.
1106555,15610319,2014-07-12,14766303,Jacques,"Nous sommes arrive avant 3 heures. Nous avons pu déposer nos bagages dans l'appartement et profitez de notre séjour plus rapidement. L'appartement est très beau et propre. Nous aurions aimé être informé pour le stationnement. Lorsque nous ne sommes pas résident, il est difficile de stationner notre voiture. Malgré çela nous avons pu occuper le stationnement l'appartement. Des frais supplémentaires de $20.00 par jour. La vérification par Airbnb est trop élaborée. Ça devient un peu compliqué pour la vérification."
1106555,15740012,2014-07-14,17685458,Curtis,"Edward was a great host. We appreciated everything and his apartment was in good shape, very clean, very quiet and close to everything. I own Buick Enclave and parking was a bit of a hassle in and out but overall a good experience."
1106555,15803749,2014-07-15,17697504,Zoe,Edward is a wonderful host! His house is clean and modern. contemporary style great taste! My family had a very good one night stay. Thanks again Ed!
1106555,17716938,2014-08-16,2066409,Luisa,Thank you Edward for your help. I rented his parking space it was as described. His house is perfectly located on the hearth of Boston. I saw all properties around and even tough I didn't stay in his place I can tell it has to be an amazing property. Edward answered all my questions withing minutes which it very helpful when you are booking your trip. I'll try to stay at Edward's next time!

1106555,19764112,2014-09-17,7912714,Alverson,Ed's listed parking space was ideal and perfect for my needs that day.  The space is in a central location in the city's South End neighborhood and safe. It even better if you are staying on any of Ed's Airbnb listed places. I highly recommend!
1106555,19811411,2014-09-18,21089081,Aaron,Super helpful! Found that the directions led me to the spot without much trouble.  both streets that lead to the alley are one ways in the same direction.
Be sure to park on the left.,,,,,

1106555,20068346,2014-09-22,11150275,Sue,We used the parking at the apartment. It was very convenient and very good value.
1106555,20321153,2014-09-27,4579669,Adriana,It was great staying at your apartment. Just a nice place with a great location! And it was good to have a place to park our car in front of the house. It couldn't be better!

1106555,21428060,2014-10-17,11939735,Rose,Edward made us feel very welcome! It was great having his car park space for the days we were in Boston.
1106555,22482975,2014-11-08,13105662,Julio,We were going to a medicalcongress and decided to  use Airbnb as we are doing frequently.
After some messages,always with prolixanswers,we decided to rent.,,,
We needed the apartment for 7days but it was available only for 5days. Edward offered us the penthouse for 2days and promised to help us with our luggage because there were a lot of stairs from 1to other. Believing in it we had rent the penthouse.,,,,,
The bad things started when we arrived. The parking that wehad rent and paid separated was,a real swamp,and after a raining day,we had to walk among the mud until the backdoor. I had to walk untill the frontdoor,one square of mud to open that.,
The studio,was a basement,dark,dusty and smelling bad. If you see it at the website andsee it alive you will believe in photoshop. There were scary statues at the wall and a lot of old food atthe freezer. We found also a bag with some dirt clothes into the wardrobe. We expected somebody there to showus how to use the things into the apartment,where we could find brooms,vacuumcleaner and things to clean the place but nobody appeared. The dishes were dusty and the blackcarpet was dirty.
The towels lookslike sandpapers.,,,,,
We cleaned the things and as we didn't have toomuch time,we decided to stay.,,,,
The second day the wi-fi didn't work and we texted Edward and he told us that his wi-fi was workinggood and that he tryed to fix ours. We stayed more than 24hours without connection. Instead of invite us to go to the penthouse to use it,he suggested us togoto Starbucks.,,,,
The first time that we met him we expect something like,good afternoon or a welcome,but he was talking with his cellphone and didn't talked nothing tous. Later he knocked our door andagain just said tous that he was trying to fix the wi-fi.,,,
Changing the rooms we combine at 9 A.M. and nobody,Edward or his employees appeared. We had to carry all our luggage for a lot of stairs,very narrow,alone.,,
We left all our luggage under the stairs,with no safe and went to our congress.,,,,
Around 4 P.M. we returned,and we were invited to take our shoes off and we had to walk on a,not too clean,ground. Edward was washing 2 hand towels that he said that we left into his studio,dirt,and said that we left the studio messy.
What about the clean tax?,,,,,
I said him that I had some complains and he answered me: You have to leave this house right now !,,,,,
That time we had to look in a hurry for some available room in Boston,took our luggage and went out.,,,,
If you are lookin for a good place,with somebody gentle and helpful,forget Edward,basement (called studio),penthouse and his swamp (called parking).,
We never had been outraged like that.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1106555,23029035,2014-11-20,23019995,Anna Maria,"We stayed in Boston for two days and we found the house very comfortable and clean. The neighborhood is charming and quiet and me, my boyfriend and my two other friends were very happy with our choice. The owner Ed was welcoming and truly nice; we asked him for tips and advice and he was always ready to help us. We thank him very much!"
We went with a car and were able to book a car space behind the house from the owner,because the parking in the street is reserved for  residents. So that's a plus of the accommodation.,,,,
Overall,"this house is a perfect solution if you want to visit the city and have all the comforts of a house. Hope to come back!\"",,,,
1106555,24217404,2014-12-22,179620,Hunter,Great to have this available. Thanks!

1106555,27524705,2015-03-06,16761385,Olivier,"Again, this is a review for the parking spot only, which would have been a bit hard to find, but Ed provided great indications.  It was free of snow on my arrival, despite the huge amount that had fallen int he previous days.  Definitely a great plus to have next door dedicated parking in Boston !"
1106555,29625753,2015-04-10,22703141,Michelle Rui,Follow Ed's direction. It's very clear and made the parking easily. I park a mid size car. It seems it is good for a regular SUV. Great!
1106555,38982991,2015-07-20,28325248,Christian,Just a parking spot...but convenient and safe!
1106555,40188505,2015-07-28,3192227,Girah,Ed has it all figured out when it comes to South End Boston living. Booking this spot was easy and super convenient to park my rental car. Don't chance getting a ticket in the city!
7694365,82868019,2016-06-30,519681,Paulina,I love the neighborhood. The listing is super accurate.  Being on the 4th floor made a huge difference.  Alicia was super responsive and solved everything quickly and efficiently.  Will look to stay here next Summer.
6356533,44310939,2015-08-25,27785283,Hamza,"While the apartment and location are fantastic, there were two alarming aspects about the apartments that were not mentioned. We booked one apartment on the 13th floor and the other on the 6th floor. The 6th floor apartment was facing a construction site that woke up even the heaviest of sleepers. But we understand that construction is sometimes unavoidable...however the 13th floor apartment, it was never mentioned that the apartment was in right next to the trash chute. The awful smell of trash pervaded the entire apartment and even after we tried putting candles and air refreshens by our door, the smell persisted. We tried complaining but to no avail. We wish we had known that we were booking an apartment that was neighboring a trash chute, as we  would not have booked it otherwise."
6356533,47830100,2015-09-21,11162479,Paola,The apartment is in perfect condition. It was perfect for the purpose of the trip. Would definitely rent again!!

6356533,50374649,2015-10-11,19517747,Tricia,"We enjoyed our stay in the Fenway 2 bedroom apt 638.  The pictures on the listing weren't exactly the unit, but that was ok.  The apartment was clean and spacious.  Easy check in.  Location was great for getting to the T and within walking distance of shopping, restaurants, and bars.  Parking was more than listed, but expect to pay $51/day in building, not $32."
6356533,55928120,2015-12-07,8972939,Luigi,"Excellent organization, spacious apartment with all amenities and good location for our needs. Supermarket, Starbucks, bank office and other stores nearby as well as the Fenway subway station. 5 minutes of walk to Harvard Medical School. We will come back soon. Thank to Mike"
6356533,58190771,2016-01-01,5540779,Matt,"Apartment was nice, just as described in listing.  Our check in process was very smooth and building staff were very nice and helpful (even though, or maybe because, it was x-mas eve).  Finishes and furniture in unit are cheap, but not unbearable.  We did have an issue with the bed in the Master bedroom that became quite an ordeal.  Both mattress and box spring we're broken upon arrival, because it was a holiday weekend, it took a long time and a number of phone calls to try to work out a resolution.  Management was helpful and did try to fix the issue, it just didn't happen very quickly and we were left sleeping on a broken, and very uncomfortable bed, for 6 nights.  Because of this, they did comp us 2 additional nights at no cost.  We would have preferred a comfortable bed for the duration of our stay, but the ultimate resolution of 2 free nights was nice (although they did not offer that, I had to ask for it).  I would stay here again, but I'd check both beds upon arrival inspection to make sure there were no issues."
6356533,60273294,2016-01-21,28005396,Marie Therese,We enjoyed our stay very much.
The apartment was as described,in an excellent location. It is well lighted,clean,with very comfortable beds and everything for our basic needs.,,

Quantité de vaisselle un peu juste,mais bonne réactivité de Mike qui répondu à notre demande en 24h pour nous fournir,suite a notre demande,un fer a repasser et quelques cuillères ( il n’y en avait que 3 pour un appartement de 4 a 6 personnes).,,

6356533,78168980,2016-06-05,7201885,Beate,"The Flat is great. About the Service: It shows, that is is a Corporate Company who owns a lot of Flats in the building. So for 3 people staying 7 days, they gave us 1 dishwasher tablet and 1 sample of washing powder for the whole time! No icecubes in the fridge - generally not very generous for such a high price."
6356533,80143801,2016-06-16,62372714,Thomson,The apartment is very good. One thing that is different from the photo is the unit is not on the higher floor as describe on the photo.
Other than that it is a very pleasant stay and the staff are fabulously helpful.,,,,,

He met us exactly on time, explained the accommodations, and gave us his thoughts on exploring the city.  The accommodations were right in the center of Downtown Boston making it the perfect center for all of our daily activities.  Plus it was extremely clean, having just been refurbished, and perfect for our family of five.  Big Thank You to Mike for making our stay so comfortable."
13275308,79514334,2016-06-13,44087136,Joe,"Mike arranged for us to be met by a BNB Caretakers staff member to give us our keys and provide a welcoming tour of the apartment. Everything was so tidy when we arrived, and we could tell that the apartment had been prepared with a great deal of TLC! From the towels that were folded and placed at the foot of the bed to the complimentary chocolates, granola bars, and travel shampoos, it truly felt like we were staying in a hotel with all the comforts of a home. The beds were extremely comfortable, the kitchen was beautiful with new appliances, and the bathrooms were extremely clean!"

Very comfy beds and they were kind enough to meet us early to drop off luggage the day we arrived.  We were two couples sharing the apartment  and the price we paid was so much less than what hotels in the area were going for-- it was a bargain ! We plan to use this place again and tell all our friends.
13275308,81958033,2016-06-26,31999704,Rithika,"Mike was a wonderful host with a lovely apartment. He was helpful and quick to communicate and clear up any problems or questions.

It was right in the heart of the financial district within easy walking distance to Fanueil Hall and Rowe's Wharf.  When we arrived snacks were provided and the Airbnb caretaker provided us with a nice overview of the apartment.  We would definitely stay again at this luxury apartment in the heart of the city.  Thanks Mike!

13275308,85406753,2016-07-11,71009940,Jaclyn,"Highly recommend this place! We were wonderfully surprised with this apartment. It is in a great location - we walked to all of the sights we wanted to see. The apartment was clean and big enough for the five of us staying there. Our arrival time got messed up because of traffic (we were coming from 5 hours away), but the key exchange person was great. She contacted us via cell phone and was able to meet us when we eventually made it to Boston. Thanks for such a great experience!!"

13275308,89067172,2016-07-26,45767936,Jethro,The apartment is clean and lovely and exactly as advertised. Four of us stayed here (two couples) for four nights and found the location of the apartment was fantastic. Close to everything Boston has to offer. Michael was a good host and always responded on the rare occasion we needed him. He even came out to the apartment at 10pm when we had an issue with the laundry machine and fixed on the spot.
13275308,91066281,2016-08-03,71115253,Todd,"Plenty of space for a family of 6. Perfect location. Easy walk to Boston Public Market, Faneuil Hall, and the North End. Relatively quiet for being right downtown."
Three Pro Tips:,,,,,
* If you're there on a Sunday,take a stroll down to the Ink Block for the South End Open Market. You can thank me afterward.,,,,
* The Roche Bros at Downtown Crossing has a great deli and antipasti bar. They have all the groceries you need.,,,,,
* Beware of parking overnight in the area. I ended up parking in the Post Office Sq garage a few blocks down Milk St. for $9 per night.,,,,,

1131634,17436463,2014-08-12,11005629,Denise,Staying in Richards luxury condo was our first airbnb experience.  It was everything he described and more. It was not only organized and convenient but the level of cleaning and comfort far exceeded my expectations. The pool and laundry facilities were an extra plus. I would recommend this far above hotel or timeshare lodging.
1131634,20489199,2014-09-30,15390824,Beatrice,"Me and my boyfriend hadn't used airbnb before so we were slightly nervous, but there was no need. The apartment was huge, with everything you could possibly need. Big comfy bed, modern bathroom & kitchen, living area with a huge cable TV. The apartment block was safe and quiet, and in an amazing location just seconds from North Station to get the train anywhere, but also in walking distance of nearly everything. Richard had provided things like fluffy white towels, a hairdryer, bathrobes, just like a five star hotel, but for half the price, along with an info pack with instructions on how to use things in the apartment, maps, and suggestions of where to go and eat around the area! So helpful. Overall, a luxurious, hassle-free, beautiful apartment that was our haven to relax after sightseeing in Boston all day. Book this apartment!!!"

Few minutes from Wholefoods and CVS. 10 minutes walk to Red line subway station. Only remark we have is that since the apartment faces south-East,"the current blinds do not prevent a lot of light to come into the Bedroom. So if you want to sleep after sunrise - wear eye covers.... Otherwise make it your first choice.\"",,,,

9430774,55490874,2015-12-01,49275021,Jules,Rania's apartment was absolutely exquisite! Very clean and well furnished. She had an attendant come meet us within 5 minutes of arriving who walked us through all of the amenities. The South End neighborhood was very cute and easily walk able. I would recommend this place for your stay!
8663351,54055131,2015-11-15,48529478,Arjun,It was perfect! Amazing location so close to downtown Boston in a great area. Very accommodating and clean apartment.
8663351,54633338,2015-11-22,45958016,Christopher,"Lauren's studio was absolutely perfect for a stay in Boston. The location honestly couldn't be better. It's so close to multiple public transport options, plus so much is walking distance from Copley square, Copley plaza, BSO and the whole south end. The building is very well kept and the partner is spotless. The only issue for a Verizon subscriber was clear cellphone service in a first level apartment, but the side door out to a small shared patio solved that problem very quickly. Having my own studio felt like such a luxury. It's a no brainer to stay in this space."
8663351,55737273,2015-12-05,29922556,Pattie,"Lauren's partner Austin met with us when we arrived to give us a key and showed us the apartment.  He was gracious and friendly!  The home was neat, clean and as pictured.  Neighborhood and building is lovely.  We had an excellent stay!  Thanks Lauren!"
8663351,66070720,2016-03-19,28071190,Eddie,Lauren place was great. She was great to communicate with throughout my time in Boston. She was gracious enough to work around my check in and out times.
8663351,68382377,2016-04-04,12171832,Amanda,Great option for my brother and I traveling together as Lauren's place has 2 beds!

It is a conveniently located brownstone right near the Back Bay train station and a 15-20 minute walk from the stadium so it was perfect. Lauren gave detailed instructions on checking in that made it very easy even though she was not available to meet us. I would definitely stay here again if I were to travel back to Boston. Thanks Lauren and Austin for the hospitality!"
8663351,88808936,2016-07-25,25327134,Radha,"Lauren and I had great communication from the start. My boyfriend and I arrived later than expected, because of traffic, but Lauren was very accommodating.

8663351,97859601,2016-08-28,55593963,Kathleen,I stayed at Lauren's place with 2 college friends. It was an amazing place and great location. Lauren was super accommodating and great with communication. She was very understanding when I was running late from the airport. She answered all my questions. It was a great experience. I would definitely suggest Lauren's place to friends.
8686165,52342868,2015-10-28,17973087,Fiona,"My husband and I spent three nights at the flatbook property in Boston south end area and were certainly delighted with our choice. The property is finished to a very high standard,with very comfortable bed and couches,immaculate kitchen and all the appliances appear brand new.  Location was perfect for us to explore Boston and surrounding areas with the subway being a very short walk away and supermarket being directly next door."
"Communication with the company was always very quick and they were quick to respond to any queries and issues that we had. Would certainly book with them again.\"",,,,,
8686165,61997508,2016-02-10,36189664,Kerwin,"I recently moved out of Boston but continue to make regular trips back home. For my most recent visit, rather than stay in a hotel, I decided to look for an apartment through airbnb and am so happy I did. I used to live in the south end not far from Ink Block and I knew it would be a great place to stay. The apartment is new, clean, and well furnished with all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. Flatbook really thought of everything. The booking process was super easy and efficient and communication with everyone on their team was amazing. They responded quickly to my questions and made my stay extra special. I would certainly book with them again and definitely stay at this apartment. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Boston."
8686165,63960906,2016-02-28,33823639,Cederick,The rental apartment was nice. We liked the floors a lot. Everything was very clean and neat.  The location was great for our purpose.
8686165,64464323,2016-03-04,11790257,Brian,Check in to the unit to was very easy and fast. The unit itself was very nicely appointed with everything I needed and also very clean. The unit actually looks better than the pictures.

8686165,70679279,2016-04-19,10810345,Jenny,"New building with lots of amenities and the best Whole Foods. Great restaurants closeby and close enough to walk to Commons, etc. Have recommended it to family and friends for when they visit Boston."
8686165,72206105,2016-05-01,8046010,Heidi,"\"The Apartment is in a good South End location and it's nice, matching the photos. My check in however was most difficult, I have used perhaps 25 - 35 AirBNB locations and have never had this much stress. There are two organisations involved who don't merge well. The \"\"concierge\"\" at the door does not work for Flatbook. I arrived at 5:00pm I had a 7:00pm appointment in downtown."
"The \"\"concierge\"\" led me to the elevator and explained that the door would be open with keys inside. There were no keys. I had to call Montreal to talk to someone about it and they said they would discuss it with the Boston Manager. I unpacked",putting things in drawers and hanging up nice clothes. After lots of waiting and hassles with both the Montreal folks and the concierge (who were nice enough but couldn't do anything),I decided to leave without the key so I wouldn't be late. It was then I realised I could not lock the door without the key. My choice was to leave my valuables in an unlocked room,take my suitcases with me to the restaurant or be late for my meeting. After nearly two hours I received the keys only to find they didn't work. Eventually I had to move,repack,and switch to a different room (which was hard to get to because I didn't have a key for the elevator). The new room had only one key for two people which caused more problems when my partner returned. I was quite late and stressed for my meeting. It was  frustrating to have to send messages to Montreal for issues in Boston.
"Parking at the lot they suggested was $98 for my two nights.\"",,,,,
8686165,77988890,2016-06-04,62332798,Nathan,"This apartment was fantastic. Flatbook was welcoming by checking in with me via email to see how things were going and reminding me of checkout process. The place was just as described and looked in the pictures and very spacious for 2 people. The kitchen was fully stocked with cookware and utensils, which we utilized over the course of our stay, with the Whole Foods next door. They also provide you complimentary towels and toiletries in the bathroom. The 24/7 service at the front desk allowed us to check-in at 1 AM without any problems. As far as location, it's not the best part of town, but we never felt unsafe throughout our stay. There is a silver line bus stop about two blocks walking distance away, which you can connect to the Tufts Medical Center orange line. The red line is also accessible as about a 10 minute walk to the Broadway station."
8686165,79264089,2016-06-12,64401088,Scott,"We felt most welcome at INK. The host cared about us but left us alone. We had two questions and they were answered within 30 minutes. A short walk had us at shopping, restaurants, and theatre. It was the best place and we will stay there again if ever in Boston."
8686165,80305761,2016-06-17,55844077,Cherry,"\"This was my first stay with Airbnb and I was most pleased with the accuracy of the listing that initially attracted me to complete a reservation. Getting what's expected is so helpful during my experience of having to be away from \"\"home\"\" for several days. It was actually better than expected in many ways: unit felt bigger/more open than pictured; the windows have a nice view of the pool and outdoor common areas + nice landscaping; large closet"
"My only disappointment besides not getting to enjoy enough off time on the property was the cleanliness of the unit. As voiced to Flatbook \"\"Please improve on quality assurance of the cleaning service prior to new guest arrival. The property was in great shape",but seemed like it was cleaned in a rush or swept up with old rags. Spare linens in the closets were presented nicely,"yet I was reluctant to make use of them because all were obviously unlaundered from previous guests.\"\" Perhaps the prior guests left late and caused this slip in quality? I'm guessing this because upon my arrival",the unit had a strong smell like someone had just fried food. The cooking smell eventually disappeared,but the smell of old rags on the main kitchen island made it unusable throughout my stay.,
Advice for future guests: Make use of the trusty thermostat during warm weather. The unit faces east and the sun shines very bright,early and strongly against the bedroom windows.,,,,
I hope to visit Boston again,"and would definitely stay here another time and recommend to friends & family. Thanks for the experience!\"",,,,

Very close to Chinatown and the theater district.Most ppl living their are young ppl who are very vibrant. Its a great place for young people to hang out! A huge WholeFood supermarket is right downstairs, very convenient! The apartment is very clean except for the new smell. It has a full kitchen and definitely enough cups and plates for 5 ppl. The rooms are spacious! Even the closet can sleep one person. Not mentioning the free washer and dryer in the closet. However number of comforters might not be enough for more than 2 or 3 ppl."

Aside from the history of the location and the fabulous decor, it is well-situated and we were able to walk everywhere and access to public transportation was never more than two to three blocks away and the Whole Foods down the block was a huge positive as well.  I would HIGHLY recommend staying here!!"
8686165,94420932,2016-08-15,23700227,Monica,The listing was accurate and gorgeous. The location was great with fantastic amenities. The host checked-in via e-mail over the course of our stay to make sure we were comfortable. Great experience.

891661,3907652,2013-03-26,5012401,Angel,We needed a place to stay in Boston for a long weekend close to the sights and the convention center. I'm glad I found Maureen.
Maureen was very accommodating! She met me personally to go through the details of our stay,and was very willing to help and answer questions.,,,,
The condo is at a great location; we were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to see in the city! Beyond that,it was clean,comfortable and offered a nice view of the Boston Harbor.,,,
There were plenty of kitchen utensils,clean linens,towels and everything you would need.,,,
In short,"this is a great place to stay. Do not hesitate to stay here!\"",,,,
891661,3984169,2013-04-01,5195491,Erin,My husband and two young sons stayed in Maureen's studio apt.

We would definitely stay there again.
891661,4063541,2013-04-07,5185038,Martha,"Just spent 4 nights with my husband and 23 yr old son.  The apartment was exactly as advertised.  It was spotless! Nice view of the USS Constitution and Navy Shipyard.  Great location for all the sites.  Was concerned about the noise level because it faces a main street; however, was pleasantly surprised how quiet it was at night.  By 7AM the traffic did pick up, but still not a major issue."
Plenty of linens and towels and the kitchen was well stocked with all the necessities should we have wanted to cook full meals.  We did use the kitchen for breakfast and to reheat leftovers from the restaurants we frequented.,,,,,
Just a word of caution,the stairwell is tight and narrow.  We had one large suitcase which was a little cumbersome to navigate in the stairwell.  We expected this as we've stayed in similar apartments elsewhere; therefore,it was not an issue for us,but might be for someone else.,,
Loved the fact we could get into the apartment as early as 12 noon which gave us an extra half day to explore Boston.  Our flight landed at 11:30.  By the time we got a cab and got to the apartment it was 12:00 and Angela (Maureen's assistant) was already there waiting for us.,,,,,

Also, the towels and linen smelt lovely, and the whole apartment was extremely clean."
891661,4313087,2013-04-27,5620754,Brieanna & Danny,This apartment was perfect for what we needed.  My husband and I stayed for 3 nights while on vacation and were incredibly pleased with how central this place was.

891661,4919672,2013-06-02,2396122,Claire,"Maureen's place is in a great location to explore Boston. Communication before I arrived was easy. Key exchange was simple - I waited maybe 10 mins for Ralph to arrive with the keys. A quiet street at the steps of the bustling North End. No shortage of fabulous restaurants on your doorstep and a great local pub just a few doors down. Boston is easy to navigate on foot and Maureen's apartment was a wonderful base. You will need to climb some narrow steps so keep this in mind if you've got lots of luggage. Make sure you bring soap as it wasn't provided. All linen and towels were. There was an overhead fan to keep the air in the apartment moving - though was really warm on my last day there - and no airconditioning. All in all, a good stay."

I traveled to Boston with my two teenage sons and we were lucky enough to stay in Maureen's rental.  This quaint apartment was located right in the North End - that's the middle of everything in my opinion.  A harbor view, great restaurants, the Freedom Trail, etc...all within walking distance.  The apartment itself was clean and felt spacious for all three of us.  Ralph met us with the keys upon our arrival and was the sweetest man ever!!  Thank you for giving us a safe and comfortable place to lay our heads after some long days of sight seeing.  The staircase to the unit was a bit tight and steep, but we just considered it part of our exercise each day.  Thank you for a GREAT stay!!"

891661,5580989,2013-07-07,6236775,Chris,"Recently stayed at Angela's North End aparment over the 4th of July holiday.  Couldn't have been a better experience.  The location is perfect.  You are within footsteps of all the great Italian restaurants.  You are within walking distance of most anything else you want to see in Boston.  As with the rest of Boston parking is at a premium, but there are 2 parking lots (one garage and one open lot) that can be used and are very close.  The view from the aprtment is great as well.  We experienced 90+ heat while there and the AC in the apartment worked flawlessly.  The unit is updated and well appointed.  Overall a great place to stay if you are visting Boston."
891661,5711957,2013-07-13,6095637,Stephanie,"We enjoyed our stay at this cozy apt.  It now has air conditioning and was very comfortable on the hot & humid Boston days.  The location is a short walk from the T, but very doable.  We felt very safe at this location and throughout the city.  We stayed there with our 5 year old son.  We used the fold out bed as the full bed isn't large enough for the 3 of us.  Both were comfortable.   I wouldn't recommend more than 3 people.  Ralph was waiting for us when we arrived, making the check in process very simple.  The Waterfront Cafe just down the block is excellent, as are all of the restaurants we tried in the North End and throughout Boston.  Parking is tricky and expensive - we returned our rental car and got the weeklong pass for the T.  The best way to drop off luggage before returning the car is to park temporarily on Foster St which is right at the entrance to the apt.  We took a cab back to the airport for about $15.  Bottom line - would stay here again - great value!"
891661,6044726,2013-07-28,6167674,Jonny,"Prima gelegen en goed uitgeruste studio in North End. Vele restaurantjes op wandelafstand achter de hoek.

The heart of North End is steps away where we found great restaurants, convenience stores, and laundromats. Just off of the Freedom Trail, we were able to do much of our sightseeing on foot (the Paul Revere House and Old North Church are just around the corner). It's an easy 10 minute walk to either North Station or Haymarket Station, and the water taxi from Long Wharf down the street is a great way to see the city and travel to/from the airport."
Although the studio is in a great location,it wasn't as comfortable as we would have liked. Missing were a toaster and coffee maker,although an espresso machine was available. The shower was also difficult to maneuver in and the studio is up two narrow,winding flights of stairs. However,there were plenty of towels provided,and the space was very clean!
We didn't get to meet Angela,but Ralph was a great help and very responsive to our needs. Thank you,Ralph,"for a great stay!\"",,

This second floor walk up is just right, high enough to get the harbor view without having to climb to many stairs.  Across the street is a public pool and the coast guard.  If you take the path between you have access to the harbor with benches and sunsets.  Everything you need for living is on either Hanover or Salem street.  We walked to the apt from the train station and then to the Blue line Aquarium tram stop to get to the airport.  At the end of Salem st and across the small park you will find the Green tram line.  Both the bed and the sofa in the apt were very comfortable.  We wish we had stayed longer as the North End experience had so much to offer.  My favorite was Caffe Vittoria on Hanover for cannoli and cappuccino."

Close to everything and appreciate the maps of Boston included in the room. Our favorite was the special care we received from Ralph.

891661,7091980,2013-09-06,5685141,Krista,"\"This small studio apartment was just the right size for 2 of us staying in Boston. Mostly clean (I'm a stickler with that). But the best is location. Can't say  enough about that. Looking out the front window is the harbor and the USS Constitution (Old Ironsides) along with the Bunker Hill Monument in the back ground. Everything is within walking distance. We walked the 3 miles to Fenway Park for an afternoon ballgame. Walked the Freedom Trail. Walked to the Aquarium. Walked just a couple blocks to fantastic Italian restaurants, same street that Mike's Pastry and the famous cannoli is located. Also walked to Quincy Market. Sounds like a lot of walking, but with the location of the North End it seems at times \"\"just steps away.\"\" Also"

891661,7274791,2013-09-14,7459790,François,"The location was perfect! My grandparents, my aunt and my mother really liked it! We recommand it. The only thing: there were some dirty plates in the dishwasher (not that bad... we just want to mention it). And if you have a lot of luggages... you have to get to the third floor with them! Be ready for some exercice. Thank you very much for your place."
891661,7503135,2013-09-23,6209873,Michelle,"I have nothing but great things to say about my stay in this beautiful studio apartment and about Boston in general. Ralph was very accommodating and even though my flight was 2 hours late, was still able to meet me and deliver the keys with no delay whatsoever. The studio is nicely furnished, well equipped and was absolutely perfect for my needs. It was lovely to wake up with a view of the water and the USS Constitution every day. The location could not have been better – within walking distance of several T stations, on The Freedom trail and just around the corner from all those wonderful Italian eateries. Amazingly I didn’t put on a single pound during my stay, despite finding a fantastic deli just 5 minutes away on Commercial Street! Living in this apartment for just over a week made me feel like a local but with the luxury of not working. I was really able to get the very best out of my vacation and come back each night to relax in comfort. Next time I come to Boston – and there will definitely be a next time – I would love to be able to stay here again. Thank you Paolo!"
891661,7584754,2013-09-25,8530059,Hugh,"Paolo's place was really great. No waiting around to pick up keys, very clean and just as in description and photos. Great location by the waterfront and atmospheric North End. If you like good  Italian food, you're in for a treat. Only negative would be proximity to the main T lines."
891661,7626537,2013-09-27,8480342,Tara,"The apartment was great, bright and clean. Comfy bed, nice shower and just an overall awesome space.

Paolo was in touch via messaging and answered any questions we had."
891661,7704257,2013-09-30,8480794,Sean,Paolo's apartment is absolutely gorgeous. The location right near the water in the North End is ideal for anyone visiting the area and the apartment has everything you could ask for in a studio.
Paolo was incredibly kind and generous in all of our correspondence and even when we had a small issue with the bed,"he remedied the situation very quickly. Definitely recommend this apartment for anyone visiting Boston. I'll be back!\"",,,,
891661,7767607,2013-10-02,6676745,Deborah,Great location. Within a block of the tour bus stop. Clean with a beautiful view. Would definitely stay again.
891661,7912749,2013-10-08,6439755,Sue,Our stay at Paolo's place in the north end of Boston was very enjoyable.   We loved the atmosphere of the Italian section and enjoyed the rest of the city as well.  Our first trip to Boston - and - not our last!
Both Paolo and Ralph were very accessible and easy to communicate with.,,,,,
As others have commented,the stairs can be a bit daunting after a full day of trekking the city - but a good workout - and the view from the apartment window is a bonus once you concur the stairs!  Would love to visit and stay @ Paolo's place again.,,,,

Еще быстрый интернет, новое, свежее постельное белье и полотенца.

The view of the USS Constitution and the location in North End really made it a wonderful stay. The stairs were narrow, but manageable. Other reviews had mentioned no soap, toaster, or coffee pot, but all of these were there. I had expected the neighborhood to be a little noisy, but it was quiet even on the weekend nights. We were not sure if the sheets were clean, but there was another set in the cabinets and we changed them out just in case. We definitely recommend this place."

The place is very nice and incredibly convenient---a great location right near Hanover st. in the North End and a quick walk to both North Station and Haymarket.

It's in easy walking distance to amazing restaurants and bakeries. There's a 7-11 down the corner in case you forgot to pack anything and there are a handful of subway stops nearby. Everything was as stated in the listing, communication was fast and easy, and the check in and check out process was also seamless and smooth.

The neighbourhood is lovely,we loved being in the North End,so much good food and interesting things to see. We walked everywhere from the apartment,into the city,and over to the USS Constitution etc. It is walking distance to most places if you are reasonably healthy and able bodied,but if not maybe consider staying in the centre of the city
The views from the apartment are also pretty nice,over a sports field to the water.,,,,
It was reasonably quiet here too,slightly away from the hustle and bustle of the main street in the North End,but still close enough to enjoy it all.,,,

891661,15127788,2014-07-03,7272265,Melvin,"This was an excellent choice for a couple and their 15 year old grandson,  Not a large studio, but adequate for a week.  View of the harvor and old ironsides in the Navy Yard across on the other side.  The Navy shoots off a cannon at 8 AM and 8:23 PM.  There is a park with ball fields across the street.  Only drawback, the bus runs only for a couple of hjours in the morning and a couple of hours in the afternoon.  Thus, for public transit we walked to the North Station (about 0.5 miles) or the Aquarium  Stop (about 0.7 miles.  There are many restaurants nearby, the Waterfront Cafe being only two doors down from Foster Street."

If you fly into Boston the best way to get there is to get the free SL 1 (Silverline 1) shuttle bus from the airport and get off at South Station,go up to street level and get a cab from there to the apartment - it will cost 10 bucks including tip,not worth messing about with anything else. Car not needed in Boston,"if you do get one good luck with the parking of it! \"",,

We loved the veiw of the boats coming and going particularly at sunset. The proximity to little Italy was perfect for us. The narrow streets,historic buildings and range of places to eat is just FAB. We walked the town, using the subway just once. We would highly recomend this accommodation to anyone. Do note there is a fairly narrow spiral stair case and you are on the second level. Certainly not an issue  for us but may be a problem if you have very large heavy luggage or  are not fairly able."

The area is fantastic and only a few minutes walk from Hanover Street which must have more great restaurants than any other street in the world.  Could see both Bunker Hill monument and SS Constitution from our bed!  Would love to stay here again.  Only negative was the traffic noise ( take ear plugs) but then it is a city.

The apartment was clean.  The bed was comfortable.  The view includes the harbor and the USS Constitution just across the water.  We were made aware of the winding steps and they were no problem for us.  If you have difficulty with steps you might want to take that into account.  The purpose of our trip to Boston was to see the historical sites of Colonial Revolutionary Boston and that is what we did.  This location is perfect.  The North Church (one if by land . . two if by sea ) was only 219 paces from the door.  We walked to all the locations on the Freedom Trail.  We explored all the sights from the Boston Common to Bunker Hill.  Added to that we were in the North End and the Italian district with great restaurants, and bakeries.    During our stay we took the T to Cambridge, watched the Regatta on the Charles and toured Harvard.  Another day we went to some of the Boston fine arts venues.  And of course we had to take the ferry ride to Salem.  The ferry docked a few blocks from the apartment."
We were pleased with the communication with Paolo.  He provided us with detailed directions and helpful hints including the best ways to get from the Airport to the apartment.  The local contact,Ralph,was very accommodating and helpful.  When our flight arrived later than planned,Ralph gladly adjusted his schedule to meet us at the apartment.,,

The suburb of North End was amazing,so many awesome Italian restaurants,bakeries,small bars and a great comedy spot that we went to called Improv Asylum.,,
It's very conveniently located,a short walk from so many great Boston sites.,,,,
I was sad to leave and will definitely try and stay again when I come back to Boston.,,,,,
"I would happily recommend this apartment to anyone.\"",,,,,
891661,24527989,2014-12-30,22685779,Martina,"Everything was perfect, including the weather :) The location was excellent for daily trips and the view of the harbour was great as well. We had no problems to get our keys and were warmly welcomed. We would definitely recommend for anyone needing a place to stay in Boston."
891661,24700872,2015-01-02,459638,Tatsuko,"I had a 4 days short trip in Boston with my boyfriend & his best friend for the New Year's Eve. The location of the Paolo's apartment is perfect for us who love North End, that's why we choose his place. It was his agent Raph who welcomed us and everything was very smooth and easy. The apartment was just as we expected, comfortable and clean."
We had a great stay there and we really thank Paolo & Raph!,,,,,

891661,25263501,2015-01-11,18435596,Jo,We had a great time at Paolo's place. Ralph was easy to get in touch with and the apartment itself was perfect for what we wanted. It was just a short walk to the nearest T stop and the Italian influence of the North End meant there was plenty of places to choose to eat at. Highly recommended :)
891661,25364174,2015-01-13,22474079,Janet,"I had a bit of a panic because calling 24 hours before arrival, as required, had been very difficult and I hadn't done it.  This didn't turn out to be a problem as Ralph was on hand to let us in."
Up 2 flights of narrow stairs with suitcases was tricky but Ralph helped.,,,,,
Apartment was clean and as described.  Very well stocked with linen,towels,toilet paper etc. and had little conveniences like sachets of sauces and shampoo.,,,
Main bed was very comfortable,shower was good and hot,though a little patchy in spray distribution.,,,
We used the sofa bed which had the comfort of a sofa bed.  Once it was pulled out though,there was very little room in the place to house our 2 open suitcases.  It is a one room,small apartment which was fine for me and my son but any more than 2 would start to get quite impractical.,,,
It was lovely and warm as we were there in winter.,,,,,
Only down side would be that it is one a bust street,"so it's a bit noisy. In the middle of the night there wasn't much traffic but as soon as 6 am rolled around it was getting busy.  You can also hear people walking around upstairs.  Not a big deal and not much anyone can do about that. \"",,,,
891661,25923689,2015-01-30,11925547,Gary,Great place in a good location.  Nice apartment with all the amenities you'd need.  Close to pretty much everything within walking distance to most too.  Really well looked after by Paolo and Ralph!
891661,26413307,2015-02-12,21945321,Delphine,"Super! Nous avons passé un très bon séjour. L'appartement est particulièrement propre et très bien équipé. Nous étions à Boston en pleine tempête de neige et il était agréable de rentrer dans un appartement bien chaud bien qu'il fasse -15°C dehors. La literie est très confortable, l'appartement est spacieux. L'appartement est un peu bruyant à cause de la circulation mais je pense qu'il y a peu d'appartements réellement calmes dans une ville aussi grande. Si nous devions retourner à Boston, nous n'hésiterions pas et retournerions avec plaisir dans cet appartement."
891661,26595734,2015-02-16,11179,Barbara,"This studio is in the perfect location in the North End! It is well equipped and was very clean. Ralph the caretaker is charming and extremely helpful. Light sleepers should bring earplugs if not used to city noise as it is on a corner of a busy street. The local and easy to walk to restaurants, Italian market and pastry shops are divine!! Would definitely stay here again."
891661,27290537,2015-03-01,23563601,Suzanne,"Paolo's place has a lovely view of the water and is situated right near everything a visitor to the North End would need. He made arrangements for Ralph from a local reality office to meet me at the building, give me keys and a tour of the apartment. The unit was well appointed and the building, although on a busy street, was quiet."
Paolo was a pleasure to deal with as was Ralph. I would recommend this unit. It's a terrific location,"situated on the Freedom trail and close to many restaurants and shops.\"",,,,

Modern appliances and plenty of equipment for cooking.  The location was terrific.

891661,28783762,2015-03-30,24819701,Elizabeth,"Paolo's apartment was the perfect spot for me. My daughter lives around the corner and just had twins. During this stressful time of premature twins, it meant so much to me to not have to worry about where I was sleeping at night. It was so convenient to be able to be there to help her first thing in the morning (after I had enjoyed a nice cup of coffee that I made for myself in the apartment) and then return at night, exhausted, and fall asleep in the comfortable bed. The apartment was clean and had everthing that I needed."
When I arrived in Boston,Ralph walked over to my daughter's and met me there with keys and the necessary info. He was very welcoming and kind.,,,,

Hay dos estaciones del metro cerca, North Station y Aquarium, aunque en el mapa parece retirado, no lo son. En el departamento hay guías para visitar Boston, las cuales nos fueron muy útiles."

The apartment was clean and comfortable although you have to be prepared for that walk to the third floor.  It is conveniently located within walking distance of the heart of the North End so I was able to enjoy the dining experience and the view is very nice from the apartment.  There was a little noise from the upstairs tenant as they had company watching a sporting event the first night, but aside from that it was enjoyable.  I would definitely do it again."
891661,29810156,2015-04-13,22122845,Cody,the apartment was ready when promised and the representative was polite and informative.  The location is great--in the North End near the Italian restaurant district and close to the TD Garden where the games we came to see were held.  The place is cozy but perfect for what we needed. You do hear some traffic noise but not horribly so.

We had no trouble finding the studio and we had Ralph (from the local real estate) that came to meet us.  He is a very nice man and he was able to explain everything we needed to know.  The studio was exactly what we expected.  It was clean and we had all the advantages with the kitchen, extra towels, internet...  Nice neighborhood, especially being so close to the waterfront.  It was nice to run there.  We were able to walk everywhere; lots of restaurants walking distance.  We had a very nice time."
891661,30597989,2015-04-25,20629974,Matt,Thank you so much for letting us stay at your place! Ralph was so helpful and we appreciated him so much. Only suggestion we would make would be to add amenities on the site (iron etc...) but honestly we have no complaints!
891661,30760870,2015-04-27,26862828,Joy,"Wow!  What a great place.  We were very impressed.  The apartment had great views, large kitchen, and a good sized bathroom, and very clean.  Lots of windows that let all of the sunlight in.  Plenty of towels and extra sheets too.  Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend Paolo's place to others and stay there again myself.  A couple of points that others have mentioned, the stairs to the apartment are spiraled and steep, which wasn't a problem for us.  Also since it faces Commercial St. there is street noise.  Again, not a problem for us at all.  Thanks Paolo (and Ralph)!"

We received the apartment in a very clean condition and in a god shape.  A few amenities we would have appreciated would be a laundry and dryer machine. When we got there we found no shampoo or soap. Besides, the entrance door was not a strong one.  Finally, it was a second floor through a steep ladder. If you have certain disabilities it might complicate your stance."
891661,33424713,2015-05-28,23494944,Jason,Paolo's apartment was exactly what we were looking for during our stay in Boston. Bright and spacious with good views and in a good location.

We parked around the corner per Ralphs recommendation, $34 - but that is typical for downtown. We were able to walk to the Old Town Trolley Tours which included a Harbor Cruise that gave us a great overview of the City. We then after our second trip around we hopped off at the visitor center beginning to do the Freedom Trail (walking tour), which takes us practically right to the flat. We drove to Bunker Hill the next day and climbed 294 steps. The USS Constitution is in dry storage. The weather was a bit rainy, and cold, but the flat is well insulated and stayed warm. Used the fridge, oven & coffee pot! The flat was very clean, we came right when the house cleaners were finishing and everything was well disinfected - spotless.  Thank you, it was a fabulous trip for us!"

We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again the next time we visit Boston."

Apartment was clean,modern,and had more than enough room for two,with separate beds (using the convertible sofa). Neighborhood seemed safe and quite,other than the street construction currently active during the day.,
If I'm going to pick out anything negative to say it would only be these two very minor details:,,,,,
1. We figured it out soon enough,but the first walk down the stairs of the shared hallway in the dark was treacherous. Then we found the light,literally,so no problems. Would be helpful to point that out during check-in.,,
2. There was no cable TV,just off the air local stations. I had no problem with that--we weren't there to watch TV--but my son was a bit disappointed.,,,,

"Thanks Paolo and to Ralph and Richie for easy access!!\"",,,,,
891661,59459612,2016-01-11,39601383,Maxime,L'appartement était exactement comme sur mes photos.
L'organisation à été très claire et facile,il est simple de communiquer avec Paolo. Ralph nous a répondu promptement ce qui nous a facilité l'entrée dans le logement.,,,,
L'accueil fût génial,la personne nous aillant remis les clefs était très sympa et nous a tout très bien expliqué en insistant qu'elle restait à notre disposition 24h sur 24.,,,,
L'appartement est bien situé dans Boston,proche d'une station de métro et à seulement 10min en taxi de l'aéroport.,,,,
Notre séjour fut agréable notamment grâce au studio.,,,,,
Seul hic le clic clac,en mode canapé il est très confortable,seulement une fois passé en mode lit le matelas est très fin,les ressorts vous massant le dos. Je le recommande pour 2 adultes sans soucis,pour 3 si vous êtes courageux pour le clic clac. ^^,
Mis à part cela l'appartement est très bien équipé,"en somme une très bonne adresse !\"",,,,
891661,60151993,2016-01-19,44507093,Sam,"Staying at Paolo's place was fantastic! He was very helpful and communicative on all the necessary details, even while he was out of the country during our stay. The apartment was clean and quite spacious for two people, and a north end waterfront experience is hard to beat. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Boston."
891661,60610167,2016-01-25,9805832,Amanda,"I would definitely stay at Paolo's place again. Paolo and the property manager, Ralph, are easy to work with.  We had one hiccup in scheduling, but Paolo righted the situation immediately.  Paulo's place is such a short walk from the Old North Church.  Very convenient for walking the Freedom Trail.  The neighborhood is safe and there's several Italian restaurants and convenience stores within walking distance."
891661,61760270,2016-02-08,10891588,Caitlin,"We coordinated with Ralph, who was helpful getting us our key, showing us the place, and recommending a place to eat. The studio it pleasant and looks like it does in the photos. It was perfect for my husband and me."
891661,63329203,2016-02-22,16641653,Chris,"We really enjoyed our stay here - the picture is out the main window and is accurate - you can see the water, baseball field and a bit of foot traffic."
Inside was as described - 1 bed and a pullout (slightly uncomfortable) - great for 2 people.  Tracy helped us get in the building,she recommended we park in garage (about 3 minutes from place).,,,,
It's a decent price for a decent place in North End - 15-20 minutes walking can get you to the Aquarium,breakfast (Theo's),pizza (Regina),bar (Roccos),TD Garden,Quincy Market
891661,64053908,2016-02-29,17872687,Rebecca,"Location, Location, Location! Our family of 4 enjoyed several days enjoying the North End and Boston sites and found Paolo's place a perfect landing spot for our trip! Ritchie met us promptly upon our arrival and oriented us to the place and was more than hospitable. There were plenty of towels and the shower was hot.  No complaints at all.  We really enjoyed being able to walk where we needed to go relatively easily.  Our kids enjoyed the little playground across the street as well. We found the best parking for our needs was just down Commercial Street a few blocks at about $34/night."
891661,65138464,2016-03-11,1479822,Tom,"Paolo has a great apartment in the Italian quarter of the city. Next street over is Hannover street with all sorts of delicious dining options. Just a short walk to downtown and the metro. The apartment was cosy and comfortable, easily suitable for a couple, or 3 people."
891661,65416970,2016-03-13,41249495,Michelle,"I was met promptly by a representative of Paolo's and she was helpful and gave us everything we needed.  The studio was just what we expected; clean, modern and efficient.  The location was fabulous with many great restaurants nearby and the river right across the park.  The only drawback was the lack of nearby parking.  We did find a lot 5 blocks away and I'm sure $63 isn't too bad for 2 days parking in the city.  We put the car in the lot and used the subway and taxis the entire time.  Overall terrific experience! We would like stay here when we're in Boston from now on!"
891661,66145638,2016-03-20,28440714,Aida,"The apartment is small but cosy, with many windows and inspiring view it feels spacious. Great neighborhood, vibrant North End with historic places just around the corner. The host was precise and helpful. Internet connection could be faster and more stable."
891661,66968478,2016-03-26,47417726,Randy,"Location, Location, Location!  A great location in Boston in Little Italy!  The apartment was the perfect size for me and my wife.  We went to Boston for 5 days and wanted to see the sights.  The apartment was perfect for us in a very safe neighborhood with easy walking access to everything.  This whole transaction with Paulo, Ralph and Ralph's nephew was great!  They are friendly, knowledgeable of the area and gave us  some great local places to go, see and the local restaurants they recommended were outstanding!  The apartment had all the necessities for a week's stay.  I can't recommend this location high enough.  Thank you for letting us stay in your home!"
891661,67607480,2016-03-30,61535116,Yang,"It was a wonderful experience. Ralph was very helpful, friendly and welcoming. Its at a great location as describe. Easy access to different places, and a safe neighbor."
891661,68668560,2016-04-06,31592036,Barb,"Paolo was very helpful from the time our reservation was confirmed.  He provided driving, public transport directions, where to park for free, contact info for himself and real estate agent Ralph., and more. The apartment met our needs perfectly: clean, convenient to The Garden for a week of figure skating, had all we needed to make ourselves at home.  Ralph was an asset making our arrival so smooth.  Very nice view."

Although Paolo is out of the country,he has a great arrangement with a real estate firm to check guests in/out of the apartment and they were great to work with. They even helped us carry all our luggage up the stairs. When I left a pair of earrings in the apartment after we checked out,I called Ralph and he tracked them down and shipped them to me.,,,
We did hear some street noise at night,"but all in all we would definitely recommend the apartment.\"",,,,
891661,70626642,2016-04-19,7108291,Elizabeth,"Paolo was very responsive to our emails, and his representative Ralph was friendly and welcoming. The apartment is in a great location if you like Italian food and a homey, down-to-earth neighborhood.  The view is great too, with a bay window that not only looks out on the water but also up and down the street.  The place is clean and well cared for, with a generous, functional kitchen and comfortable bed.  Can't think of anyplace I would rather stay in Boston!"
891661,71760850,2016-04-28,64246331,Andrew,North End is amazing. Thanks for the great apt!
891661,72149890,2016-05-01,32664895,Candace,Our stay at Paolo's place went great. The real estate company that met us was very friendly and made us feel very comfortable. The North End area is so beautiful and you can't beat the close access to amazing restaurants and historical sites.

891661,75137037,2016-05-19,61798310,Ralph,"Paulo was unable to meet us personally, he sent a relative to meet us. This person handed over the keys and explained how everything worked. He was also helpful in describing where we could go and good places to eat."
891661,76293780,2016-05-26,46572179,Jonathan,Great location for exploring Boston. The flat is comfortable and well maintained.
891661,76861416,2016-05-29,13868752,Jenna,"Perfect location! This was a super quick uber ride from the airport. We had a view of the harbor and could walk to all of the major historical attractions with ease. We were right around the corner from The Old North Church, which was really cool. The apartment was cozy and had everything we needed for our short stay. It was very clean and comfortable. The kitchen was sell stocked but we didn't use it since there is so much amazing food in Boston. We did store some of our leftovers from Modern Pastry in the fridge though. I will for sure stay here again the next time I'm in Boston. Checking in was a breeze."
891661,77542901,2016-06-01,48414729,Andrew,"The location was incredible - incredible access to the North End. Apartment was spotless. Plenty of essentials, and the owner was very responsive.

891661,78757414,2016-06-08,67646048,A.J,Paolo's place was in an incredible location! A short walk away from anything worth seeing on the north end. It was very clean and Ralph was more than helpful! Thanks for making our first visit to Boston a great one!
891661,80268877,2016-06-17,26264705,Mark,"Convenient Northend location and property as described, with a light and open studio apartment in a quiet building, albeit a busy street."
Nice folks met me with the keys and made sure all was well on arrival,which it was for the first night.,,,,
Unfortunately,someone changed the password on the wireless router by next morning,so my two day biz trip was hampered since I needed to camp out at Starbucks for internet between meetings.,,,
I called Ralph,the unit's manager,and he was unsure of where/how to fix the router.  2nd morning,still not resolved,,
Great spot for tourists visiting Boston and looking for a good location.,,,,,
Beware though,heavy construction starts early in the morning on Commercial St (which it looks over),"as they're adding a bike lane this summer.  I also forgot about the truck traffic on Commercial St in early AM.\"",,,
891661,80786703,2016-06-19,27715593,Monica,El departamento es muy lindo y la ubicación inmejorable.
Pero tuvimos algunos inconvenientes que no se solucionaron y nos crearon dificultades,,,,,
El mas importante,fue la falta de internet,fundamental para nosotros al buscar alojamiento y muy importante para ubicar lugares de visita,no solo eso,lo peor fue no poder hacer check in del vuelo,hubo un cambio de ultimo momento  y perdimos el avión
No funcionaba la television,habia muchos elementos privados del dueño,que como huésped complican la estadia.,,,
Poca preparacion para recibir a los huespedes (jabones,shampoo,etc,dejados x los anteriores),,
No habia blackout y la cortina  insuficiente,al ser un departamento muy luminoso,no nos permitia descansar,a las 5 de la mañana,"ya nos despertabamos porla claridad\"",
891661,81522056,2016-06-23,27946717,Don,First time visitors from Arizona.   Perfect location in the north end.   Don't look any further if you are planning to do all the tourist things.   And just a couple blocks from little Italy with the best food and pastries in Boston.    Thank you Paolo for making our visit to your apartment very comfortable.

The apartment is not large,"but it was perfect for us ( a young couple in Boston for a couple of days) as it is clean and has everything needed.\"",,,,
891661,87778116,2016-07-21,1220564,Victoria,The apartment is lovely. Exactly as shown in the pictures. We were welcome by the cousin of the manager with is a lovely person! He also helped us with the luggages and the stairs. The location is perfect for a short stay in London. We hardly recommend this place.
891661,89447527,2016-07-28,38473799,Jule,"Lovely apartment, has everything you need for a few days in beautiful Boston."
Our flight got in pretty late but thankfully Ralph organized everything so that we could get in. Thank god for the A/C since it was extremely hot,there's also a pool right opposite the apartment that you can swim in. Very close to Little Italy with a bunch of nice restaurants.,,,,
Overall very good experience,"would definitely stay again. \"",,,,
891661,93433725,2016-08-12,51746688,Jason,Perfectly located apartment in a fun part of the city. Many thanks to Ralph and team for getting us settled even though we arrived a little late. A nearby 7eleven was useful for supplies and there are oh-so-many wonderful Italian restaurants to choose from if you want to go out. Thanks again!
891661,94732730,2016-08-16,24496925,Mark,Fabulous location. Nice waterfront view from this corner unit. Super easy walking access to restaurants in North end.
891661,95229377,2016-08-18,22747683,Stephen,Great location and as described. Ideal for 3 of us and easy access to restaurants in north Boston and central areas. Local contact very helpful for checking in
12603280,75344243,2016-05-20,69040900,Natasha,"I arrived relatively late at night outside the apartment block, which was located on a quiet residential street in Back Bay. A beautiful location - great first impression."
Sadly,the check-in process wasn't as smooth as I'd hoped it would be. There seemed to be some miscommunication between the Apartment Concierge at Garrison Apartments and the Host,Furnished Quarters,which meant I wasn't able to access the apartment until an hour after I arrived that evening.,,
That said,Furnished Quarters were very helpful and apologetic. (I just hope that any confusion is ironed out for the sake of future guests).,,,,
The apartment itself was very nice - clean,modern and fully equipped,as promised. It felt luxurious,peaceful and safe - a good option for business travellers. I did notice that the images on the AirBnB advert didn't quite match the apartment itself. The ad features a living room with high ceilings and a fireplace but my apartment was a good deal smaller and didn't have the same set-up. I can only assume the Host has multiple apartments in the block with similar furniture. Not a huge deal but I think it would be good to curate the ads for each apartment to set expectations.,,
The location was great- just a stone's throw from The Prudential Center,which boasts amazing panoramic views and the cocktails at Top of The Hub (52nd floor) are worth sampling. There are lots of great restaurants and coffee shops in the area too,"(I recommend Boston Chops) and Newbury Street is just a 10 minute stroll away - a great place for high end shopping. Central Boston is just a 20 minute walk away.\"",,,
9496325,54803068,2015-11-23,41678010,Woojun,The host was very kind and fast in the response to the message. I have not met him but i can tell he was a nice person. The place is exactly mentioned as descrived the bed was big and comfortable and the living room was good for hang out with some friends. Location is close to Fenway station and also Fenway field. Overall very comfortable experience.
9496325,55490633,2015-12-01,49134377,Natalie,"We had a great trip, the location, near the MFA was great. Flo was organised. Thumbs up for Boston!"
9496325,61473971,2016-02-04,13918341,Kyla & Warren,The host canceled this reservation 71 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9496325,95233156,2016-08-18,57336545,Lindsey,He communicated well and left the towels on the bed and the note he left was very clear instructions. Other than no air-conditioning it was perfect it was just too hot which there is no control over for the host. Very comfortable and easy to get places. Either by Uber or train.
9574727,68227367,2016-04-03,14816981,Kari,"Lovely flat in an amazing building, with tons of amenities. Having a huge Whole Foods in the complex is wonderful and a real time saver for a working trip.  Vibrant arts scene a few blocks south, and I walked through Chinatown to my conference every day."
Abdin was communicative and everything was just as described.  Comfy bed,high quality linens,"very good value for money.  Looking forward to staying again! \"",,,

La chambre est agréable (calme et lumineuse). Concernant l'appartement,il faut noter qu'il contient 3 chambres toutes louées sur Airbnb et qu'une seule salle de bain pour les 3 chambres.,,,,
Le principal défaut est que l'adresse ne permet pas d'accéder au centre de Boston et de faire les principales activités touristiques à pieds. Il faut systématiquement prendre soit les transports en commun soit un taxi,,,,,

We missed each other because we were so on the run but he always stayed in contact with us and was very helpful. VERY CLEAN. Nice comfortable mattress. Well decorated. Nice dining area and great spacious kitchen with a keurig. He had dove shampoo and body wash and nice fluffy towels. Wish we could have met him. Easy to get anywhere from this location.
13391024,96113383,2016-08-21,6397067,Steven,"Hochiang was a very gracious host and I connected with him a number of times during my stay (unlike some AirBnBs where you don't see the host at all).

We had no problem finding a parking spot to unload the bags before parking in Boston Commons garage which is just a short walk away.
The apartment is as shown on the photos and in a perfect condition.  Despite July heat the AC kept the temperature inside at a very comfortable level. There were lots of nice details like shower baskets and K-cups as well as detailed instructions about various aspects of our stay. It was a lovely place to come back to after a long walk around Boston.,,,,,
Mike responded to my messages almost immediately and offered a lot of helpful advice and recommendations.,,,,,
We traveled with my 10 month old baby and both the hosts and the apartment were very kid-friendly. There was a good space to keep the stroller,plenty of fun playgrounds nearby and being able to walk everywhere was a huge bonus.,,,,

6006121,31242779,2015-05-03,12749118,Courtney,"Jake and Danny made me feel super welcome and were amazing hosts. I wasn't there much, but they were super lovely when I did run into the two of them.  Southie is a great part of town and super central for getting into downtown, and has some nice restaurants right around the apartment. Getting into the apartment was really easy, and they provided loads of Boston literature just in case you wanted to tour the city.  The room was right at the front of the apartment and had a private bath across the hall!  Hope you guys come to Germany soon xx"
6006121,32088901,2015-05-13,10935764,Sallie,"Jake was very accommodating, even though my reservation fell on a weekday when he was not able to be home on my arrival. He left me timely and simple directions for accessing the apartment and the room was perfection. My stay was comfortable and quiet."
6006121,32147885,2015-05-14,719497,Cinjon,Jake was great. I had very few requirements for the place but he was gracious in talking with me while I ate takeout and was there if I needed anything. The room was also quite nice and spacious.
6006121,32275200,2015-05-16,3952327,Mary E,"Jake has a lovely apartment and South Boston proved very convenient for me. The listing is for the room only (not use of any other part of the apt) but Jake made up for it by helping out with small courtesies. I only met him briefly and his husband not at all, but the theater memorabilia in the apt made me wish I did!"
6006121,32557875,2015-05-19,16475713,Keleher,I received an email on the date of arrival with easy to follow directions for apartment access. The room was well appointed and very private.
6006121,32863568,2015-05-22,33489600,Katherine,The apartment was beautiful and Jake was great & friendly. Thank you!
6006121,32947897,2015-05-23,31688197,Katie,"Jake and Danny were pleasant hosts and the room was very comfortable. The location was great for those wanting to be only a short distance from the downtown area. The only downside to this place was the parking. This is a residential neighborhood and most streets require a residents sticker. Visitor parking is available, but the pickings are slim and the signs are confusing. We ended up with a parking ticket despite being parked in an area that a local assured us would be ok, because it was a street cleaning day. Jake did attempt to help us navigate parking both during booking and once we reached the city and was very responsive to our other questions as well. Overall, a good experience in Boston."
6006121,33392852,2015-05-27,3471580,Stephanie,"This is a real treasure not far away from the City Center. Jake and Daniel made us feel very welcome in their wonderful apartment. Comfortable bed, conveniently located private bath, bottled water awaiting us, very hospitable hosts. Great communication. My daughter and I enjoyed our stay there very much."
6006121,33586871,2015-05-30,22345930,Marcella,Jake and Danny were very hospitable and friendly even though we saw little of each other.  The accommodations were exactly as advertised - comfortable and clean.  I appreciated coffee in the morning and the cute kitties.  I definitely recommend staying here and would stay again.
6006121,33944559,2015-06-02,21261379,Sam,"We absolutely loved staying here! Our hosts made us feel incredibly welcome. (It was my partner's bday, and we found a card and bottle of wine when we arrived!) The room is lovely, and we were crazy about the neighborhood. Lots of restaurants, bars and more nearby, and not difficult at all to get to other popular Boston locations. We also hung out on the rooftop deck, which was really cute."
We would happily go back!,,,,,

6006121,34149671,2015-06-05,32307203,Peisy,Jake's apt is a clean and lovely place. Jake and Denny are great hosts and very accommodating. The neighborhood is safe and quite and very convenient to downtown by bus.  We had a wonderful experience. Just one thing: the bed seems to be a double size rather than a queen size. My boyfriend and I are both Asian and in regular shape. The bed is too small for us. We ended up with my bf slept on the futon in the bedroom and I used the bed. The futon and the bed is comfortable though.
6006121,34236784,2015-06-06,1000527,Dominique,"Good adn quiet place! A little far (less than 2 km) from the T (underground - redline) if you have loads of luggage, but conveniently located and next to eating and facilities and a couple of shops. First time we rented a BNB in which the renters actually lived, but Jake and David are very easy and made us feel confortable at once. Private bathroom is just across the hallway (2  yards) of the private bedroom. Very good in communicating and flexible with arriving and departing hours."
"AWESOME roof terrace. Get your take-away breakfast or coctail and go consume it upstairs. Breathtaking view! \"",,,,,

They were incredibly helpful assisting us as we navigated their awesome Southie neighborhood and gave great advice on what to do/see across the rest of the Boston area.  They are tremendously gracious and sweet guys, and we would stay again anytime! Our room was clean, comfortable, and very private. They made our first AirBNB experience smooth sailing from start to finish - we simply couldn't have asked for more! Thanks guys! XO"

They were helpful with directions and ideas about things to do.  The room was just like being at home.  We especially like the Boston tour guide books.  The neighborhood was quiet and we felt comfortable walking."
6006121,37794713,2015-07-10,37066076,Jenna,"Staying here was a great experience! The room and bathroom were both large and clean. My roommate and I were on an apartment hunt and either running around like crazy all day or exhausted in the evenings, so it was nice to come back to a place that was comfortable and easy to get to."
6006121,38602143,2015-07-17,13136829,Emma,"Jake & Dannys flat was in a great location,  9 bus in to centre of town in 15-20mins. Broadway 'T' the closest but a good 15min walk to the flat & not suitable with luggage. Loads of bars & restaurants locally with Stats bar & grille 2mins from the house."

Jake's instructions on how to get to the apartment were clear, accurate and timely. I had told him about coming in from South Boston station. I had never been to Boston before. I got to his place without problem. The public transportation system is very efficient."

I had a conference at the World Trade Center which was very close by.  I brought my bike with me and biked into the conference each day which was about a 15-20 min bike ride.  It was a little tricky finding parking, I ended up parking in the wrong spot a few streets away and got a $25 ticket, but I could have probably paid closer attention to the signage, but it was confusing.  I didn't have much time to socialize, but all in all the place was clean including the bathroom and the bed was comfortable.  Thanks J!"

The bathroom was across the hallway and was spacious. Jake was there to greet us and we met Danny a few days later. The neighbour was great! Lots of pubs, restaurants and coffee shops for breakfast - we loved Cranberry Café! It was quite a walk to the Broadway subway station but as soon as we figured out that we could use the No.9 bus it was much more pleasant. It is easy to access Boston City Centre and the tourist attractions with the busses and the subway. We were there over St Patrick's Day and with so much Irish heritage in Boston it was very festive! Some coffee in the morning at the apartment would have been nice but we were also happy to head down to a nearby coffee shop everyday. We weren't aware of the roof deck but it was too cold for that anyway :) All in all a great stay!"

Parking was a little crowded on the street, but we were able to find a spot even late when we got back from exploring the city. Multiple warnings are written in instructions to not tell neighbors you're staying as a renter through AirBnB but the warnings seemed more so from previous disruptive renters. I never ran into anyone asking who I was or something like that. There was no problem getting into the apartment and overall was a good experience."
6006121,67763612,2016-03-31,42696233,Pierre,The place is quite well located and the room is very nice. But I've found the atmosphere a little stiff. You sometimes feel you're bothering the hosts...

Very comfortable and spacious room with great attention to detail, from clear instructions about amenities to complimentary bottles of water to tasteful decorations throughout the apartment. Not pictured in the photos of the room is a small sofa which can be unfolded into a single sized bed. Although not officially mentioned as an option, J&D happily provided some spare sheets and blankets, and I slept here very comfortably, since I preferred not to share a bed with my male friend. Apartment meticulously clean and kitchen well-equipped. Thanks for a great time in Boston!"

6006121,71448927,2016-04-25,32865829,Jacqueline,"J and Danny's house was absolutely beautiful, and exactly as pictured in the listing. In addition, the bathroom was large and accommodating, and the cats were exceptionally friendly."
I was not able to meet J during my stay,but I was able to have a small chat with Danny,who was an incredibly gracious host.,,,
Check-in and check-out were a breeze,"and I had an overall excellent stay in Boston.\"",,,,
6006121,71777737,2016-04-28,18866839,Svetlana,"I came to Boston for training and had a great stay at J's apartment. While the location is not central, I found it nice and easy to walk downtown and back. The room and the bathroom were clean and had everything I needed to be comfortable."
6006121,72085142,2016-05-01,64837471,Dominic,"Loved the apartment! It was in a beautiful part of town, not too far from anything. We didn't see the hosts much, but they were nice when we did see them. The bed and bathroom were both nice, and it felt homey."
6006121,72891894,2016-05-05,18142861,April,"Jake & Danny's place was very comfortable and cozy and they are very nice hosts.  The room is just as pictured and was nice and tidy.  It was really quiet which was surprising for staying in the city. It was easy to get in and out of the building.  It is really close to the main street in Southie and easy to walk to coffee shops, bars and restaurants or catch an Uber into downtown Boston.  I had a rental car and its pretty hard to have a car there because parking is a hot commodity but there was overnight parking just a few blocks from the apartment and made it easy to have my car. I would definitely recommend this place."
6006121,73599585,2016-05-08,10512815,Denise,Room comfortable. Quiet area. Minimalist welcome.
6006121,73796745,2016-05-10,25761835,Alex,Perfect Stay. The house and flat was easily found and what I found was a beautiful place located in a nice and upcoming part of South Boston. The hosts are extremely friendly and helpful and I would certainly stay again!
6006121,73945082,2016-05-11,44940403,Matt,"Had an easy and pleasant experience staying with Jake; room was nice and clean as expected, and hosts were very responsive and accommodating!"
6006121,74136727,2016-05-13,69445438,Luke,"Everything was as described, and Jake is a gracious host."
6006121,75089521,2016-05-18,67139768,Philip,"\"My flight was delayed and so I didn't get in to Boston until late on Saturday evening. J was flexible and, thanks to his instructions, I was easily able to find my key and get into the room despite it being late. I didn't see J & D much but they made me feel welcome. The room is larger than it looks in the photo and the location is good, especially for the Convention Center. There is one of the public bike hire stands (\"\"Hubway\"\") nearby and these were great for getting around - cycled to Castle Island / downtown. Also PS Gourmet Coffee is great when you are jet lagged!\""
6006121,75738853,2016-05-22,10719089,Susannah,"We had an excellent experience staying in the guest room at Jake & Danny's condo in South Boston. It was clean, quiet and convenient. We met each of our hosts briefly and separately. Mostly, we came and went without seeing them."
6006121,78442844,2016-06-06,10955578,Sherry,J was very consistent in his communication and gave easy to follow instructions! The apartment is an easy 15 min walk to the nearest T station and the room is very comfortable. Loved my stay!
6006121,79085296,2016-06-11,72731933,Karen,"I enjoyed our stay at J and recommend it.  The room was as nice as the picture, comfortable and more spacious than shown.  The bathroom was across from our room which added to privacy.  South neighborhood has good restaurants and easy accessibility.  Our hosts were accommodating and provided lots of tips in getting around the area.  Even though there was a miscommunication and we checked in much later than was convenient, I cannot hold that against my review.  Stuff happens and when you travel, you have to learn to roll with it.  I definitely recommend staying here."
6006121,79776833,2016-06-14,36841586,Michael,"Location is good, pretty close to downtown Boston and even street parking is available, yet you gotta be carefull with the signs. Bus stops are close but the subway (Andrew station) is about a 20min walk - for us it was not a problem at all and within 10mins your are in the city center. The room is nice and quiet, the private bath very convenient. A real highlight is the rooftop patio with a good view of the downtown skyline. J & D are nice hosts and their cats were very cute."
6006121,80051582,2016-06-15,5688057,Wim,"After the timely, detailed communication with Jake and Daniel beforehand their place was easy to find. They were both very helpful and informative. The location is great, and so is the room. Especially for visitors who love cats, and donot mind occasional airplane noise in the morning."
6006121,81457086,2016-06-23,39469984,Michael,After a long day I need a place to lay my head. My hosts got me into the well decorated apartment with clear directions and no issues.
After a quick,but relaxing shower in the spacious bathroom,I promptly fell asleep and unfortunately did not have an opportunity to meet my hosts.,,,
If I need to stay in Boston again,"this will be at the top of my list. \"",,,,
6006121,82870463,2016-06-30,15732779,Vítor,"I stayed in this room  for a few days and I definitely want to highlight the comfort and great conditions provided by the hosts. I was enrolled in a work trip and could not have asked for a better room and location. Everything was clean and tidy, the neighborhood was nice and the hosts were gracious and welcoming."
6006121,83395974,2016-07-02,13904086,Marísha,"The neighborhood is quiet, safe and nice. Everything as is described on the listing, and we were warmly accommodated during our stay by the guys when needed."
6006121,85758344,2016-07-13,5454266,Melissa,"Nice room, everything was as described. We didn't spend much time in the room, so we only saw our hosts briefly, but they were nice and accommodating."
6006121,85826504,2016-07-13,63292212,Gina,Jake and Danny were great hosts! They were friendly and responded very quickly to messages I sent. Their messages were very detailed and all the instructions they gave were accurate. The bedroom was much more spacious than the pictures appear. The bedroom and bathroom were both extremely clean and the space was comfortable to stay in. We only met Jake and Danny briefly late at night on the day we checked in and saw them a bit in the morning. They were both very friendly and made us feel very comfortable. I would absolutely stay here again!
6006121,86321407,2016-07-16,23999777,Joan,"We had a good experience at J's apt. It's in a nice, safe neighborhood and the photos are exactly as they appear in real life!  We were buzzed into the apt.  and all of his directions were clear. We had fun walking back to apt. from Harpoon Brewery!"
6006121,87829132,2016-07-22,66848186,Yemi,The hosts were quite cordial and very helpful in getting me situated. The residence looks as described in the pics and was kept in nice condition.  It is quite convenient for getting to the airport or the city. Parking is a bit challenging since mostly for residents with a resident permit. All in all a pleasant experience.
6006121,88549187,2016-07-24,54097161,Jacob,My wife and I came to Boston for a concert at the blue hills pavilion and we were looking for a walking distance place with comfort and good eats around. J's was great! He was very accommodating and provided all the amenities we needed. The location was very close to the concert and we loved The Lincoln which was a local American food place with wood fired pizzas. I would definitely recommend staying here to a friend.
6006121,89219201,2016-07-27,38075712,Sarah-Maud,"Great sunny room, bigger than what the photos show. Private bathroom. J was very quick to respond to email and great location!"
6006121,89448489,2016-07-28,64234552,Shalane,"The room was very nice, bed was VERY comfortable. Private bath across the hall was very clean. Cats were an added bonus. I didn't see my hosts much, as I kept early hours, but if I texted about something, they responded quickly. Neat neighborhood, lots of restaurants and bars nearby."
6006121,94138226,2016-08-14,18144013,Karen,We had a great time staying at your place!
Close to the convention center and quiet enough to sleep well.,,,,,
"Thanks for having us!\"",,,,,

6006121,97369504,2016-08-27,24363154,Amy,"I slept very well here and found the neighborhood very charming. Not in a super upscale way, just a true Boston neighborhood.  I did feel safe at all times in the neighborhood. Easy to get to many things. A local friend and I walked from the neighborhood to the ICA and back.  An Uber ride in the morning to the Boston Design Center took about 10 minutes. I didn't check out public transportation, but the hosts give you good directions if you need to use that."
I am a kitty person,so I found it nice to have cats in the house,but they were fairly independent and didn't bug me at all. I didn't end up meeting the hosts. Overall,"a great experience.\"",,

12707324,80841398,2016-06-20,48259792,Yuntao,"The location is convenient and I can park my car at the back of the building during the weekend. Yida is not at home during my stay, and his roommate took care of me nicely. No complaints."
12707324,91886061,2016-08-07,4185987,Christine,"Yingda wasn't here during my stay, but his roommates (a couple) were incredibly helpful and very quick to respond. They met me downstairs to help with luggage since there are quite a few stairs to climb! Like the post mentioned, this place is VERY close to the green line, 66, and 39 bus. It was very convenient to walk to the Longwood Medical Center, and the room offered plenty of privacy. The posting mentioned linens, shampoo, and a hair dryer, but I just brought my own. I don't think there's a hot tub in the building... unless it's a hot drawn bath in the bathroom? The kitchen is great for cooking, but it's Boston so don't expect too much room and there's no microwave. Laundry is coin-operated on the first floor. I wouldn't absolutely recommend this room, it's very affordable and the roommates were the best!"

Wir wurden nicht enttäuscht. Danielle ist und bleibt eine hervorragende Gastgeberin. Die Gespräche mit ihr sind sehr inspirierend, sie ist sehr hilfsbereit und ihr Haus ist sehr schön und sauber. Wir würden jederzeit noch einmal kommen und können sie nur empfehlen."

The house is exactly as shown, and I found it very nice, extremely clean and comfortable. The location was perfect, very close to the shops one might need and to public transportation. I would definitely recommend Danielle's place to anyone who wants to spend some time in Boston."
6019555,39672755,2015-07-25,32097900,Jakvindaer,This was my first AirBnb experience and I certainly was not let down. Danielle's place is conveniently located and has every amenity you would require to enjoy a pleasant stay. The room and beds were extremely comfortable and the WIFI was very strong. Everything was clean and tidy. I really appreciated the coffee in the morning and danielle was more than happy to assist me in planning my day.

Everything was exceptionally clean and Danielle even had snacks out for us each morning! The location was perfect because it's just a short 5 minute walk to the Orange Line (T); which only took 15 minutes to get downtown. On top of this, Danielle was very helpful and kind! We really enjoyed getting to know her! Overall, it was a fantastic place to stay and we loved our experience."

The location was good as it was close to the subway stop and we could travel into downtown Boston in about 20 minutes. The house was clean and welcoming. I would highly recommend it to other people.
6019555,45578984,2015-09-04,39770293,Michael,"Just perfect, very nice place, very comfortable. Parking can be a bit of a chore. I loved the location - checking out the cemetery is a must."
6019555,46163382,2015-09-08,38609071,Mary,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and now the bar is set high for the next one. Danielle was an amazing host. Her house was comfortable, clean, and easily accessible to public transportation. Danielle made sure I had all the information I needed and would readily answer any questions I had. Her friend and neighbor Leah was also a huge help. I could not be happier with this experience."
6019555,46595738,2015-09-12,38203299,Yung-Hsin,Danielle and Leah (her friend) are perfect hosts. Danielle’s house was comfortable and clean. Everything in her house was very good. The location was perfect as it was close to the subway stop (less than 5 mins). We strongly recommend her house.
6019555,48745216,2015-09-28,1199637,Madeleine,Superbe séjour chez Danielle! Elle n'était pas la (partie en voyage) mais Leah sa meilleure amie nous a très bien accueilli. Elle a répondu à nos questions à l'avance et ce très rapidement. Elle nous a trouvé un stationnement gratuit et sécuritaire pour les cinq jours où nous logions chez Danielle. Le logement était conformé aux attentes propre et très pratique pour y cuisiner et relaxer. Deux autres couples étaient présents durant notre séjour mais nous nous sommes à peine appercues de leur présence. Les lits étaient confortables. Le cimetière à côté en vaut le détour. La station de métro est a 2 min de marche et le centre ville y est a 20 min. De métro. Une épicerie se trouve à 10 min de marche. Quartier tranquille pour se reposer au retour d'une journée animée au centre ville de Boston. Ma sœur et moi avons adoré notre séjour chez  Danielle !
6019555,50491371,2015-10-12,4758262,Silvia,"La ubicación del lugar estuvo muy bien para el propósito de nuestro viaje a Boston porque estabamos a 1 cuadra del Shuttle para la BAA Half Marathon.  La habitación, el baño y la casa en general estaba muy organizada y la estadía estuvo a gusto.  Danielle tiene muy bien señalizadas las cosas que puedes hacer en la casa y los alrededores son muy bonitos.  El único tema para mejorar es que la opción de cama king pegando las dos camas no es tan cómodo ya que la división queda en la mitad de la espalda"
6019555,52486697,2015-10-30,42700718,Michelle,"This was a great find.  The house is very comfortable, well equipped and in a great location.  The bedroom was very comfortable and cosy and everywhere in the house was very clean.  Danielle left coffee and tea and treats out for guests which was very welcoming.  She also left clear instructions for everything you might need to use in the house.  The house manual was very useful, it contained lots of local information which I used and found invaluable.  The house is right by the underground train line so a trip to anywhere in Boston is very cheap and fairly quick.  The neighbourhood was really nice as well.  I don't think AirBnB gets better than this!"
6019555,68523164,2016-04-05,7402744,John,This abnb is terrific. My grown daughter and i stayed 3 nights at Danielle's lovely apartment in pleasant residential section of JP.
Danielle is excellent communicator,responding quickly to questions with helpful information,,,,

The lovely two floor apartment is fully and nicely decorated and clean. Bedrooms and bathrooms are too. Temperature perfect. Towels and washcloths provided.  Beds comfortable,plenty of pillows,blankets and comforters.,,,
Everything in kitchen is labeled and so easy to find what one needs quickly. Breakfasts offered hot oatmeal,daytime snacks,fresh fruit,coffee and teas and instructions on how to use coffeemaker. Milk for coffee/tea.,,
Shoeless to protect clean light colored carpet. Deep warm sofas in living area where Danielle was hanging out making us feel welcome inviting us to join her at TV or reading.,,,,,

Conversation with our host Danielle was friendly and engaging.  We had easy access to information about local stores, eating establishments and transportation options.  The accommodations were exactly as advertised, in a quiet neighborhood that nonetheless was in close proximity to the metro leading downtown."

6019555,76083542,2016-05-24,67458932,Kathy,This was the first time my daughter and I have used Airbnb and it could not have been any better.  What a wonderful place to stay very inviting and cozy.  Did not have the pleasure of meeting Danielle but met Leah who was very kind and she kept the kitchen stocked with breakfast goodies.  We had a wonderful time in Boston and if we come back then I definitely hope Danielle's place will be available!
6019555,76513579,2016-05-27,26992028,Jane,This was a great place to stay while visiting Northeastern University with my son.

6019555,82612092,2016-06-28,62795560,Alexandra,Danielle and Leah were extremely hospitable though we didn't physically meet. We felt so at home. The detail of how Danielle laid out notes around the house made us feel so welcome. Both Danielle and Leah  were very communicative which put us at ease because it was our first Air B n B experience.  The neighborhood was perfect to experience the more calm side of Boston. Overall we had a great time and already recommended this place to others.
6019555,87973270,2016-07-22,20237468,Lynn,We enjoyed our stay at Danielle's. Wish we'd had more time to explore the neighborhood. We purchased the 1 week pass for the subway system and were able to get around Boston quite easily without a car. The house is just a short walk to Forest Hill station at the end of the orange line.  Danielle and Leah were available to answer any questions.

6019555,90828068,2016-08-02,6856466,Yann,"Danielle n'était pas sur place à notre arrivée mais Leah nous avait envoyé toutes les informations nécessaires pour entrer et nous installer. Il y avait des petits post-its sympathiques un peu partout pour nous indiquer où se trouvaient les choses (vaisselle, collations, etc.). La chambre était confortable et nous avions accès au reste de la maison (cuisine, salle de lavage), ce qui fut très apprécié. La climatisation centrale était silencieuse et efficace. La maison est à 5 minutes de marche de la station Forest Hills (20 minutes en métro pour accéder au centre-ville) et de nombreuses lignes d'autobus, les déplacements ont été très faciles. Nous avons beaucoup aimé le quartier Jamaica Plain (crèmerie JP Licks, Fiore's Bakery, City Feed and Supply...). Tel qu'indiqué, le stationnement est un peu complexe, mais nous avons trouvé une place à 15 minutes de marche où nous avons pu laisser gratuitement la voiture pendant 4 jours sans problème. Nous recommandons et y retournerions sans hésiter !"

3788075,17418122,2014-08-11,17679387,Patricia E.,"Mi experiencia en esta habitación ha sido buena. La localización es estupenda para visitar Boston, porque está muy cerca de la línea roja, que tiene paradas en los principales puntos de interés sin necesidad de hacer transbordo, es frecuente y rápida. La habitación es limpia y agradable y está junto al baño compartido, lo que es muy bueno. Además, la llegada es flexible y eso facilita mucho las cosas para los imprevistos. Tal y como Steve describe, puede haber otros huéspedes pero la casa es grande, si no eres quisquilloso con los ruidos normales de una casa, está bien. Comer en el barrio es complicado, porque no hay mucha opción, pero la cocina de la casa se puede usar, es agradable y tiene todo lo necesario. Si quieres una vista diferente de la ciudad y de la Universidad de Massachusetts, sube al parque que hay cerca de la casa (gracias K!)."
3788075,18504381,2014-08-27,16521838,Rubina,"Staying at Steve's was absolutely wonderful. Located in Dorchester, it was only a few mins walk to the Field's Corner T station nearby. Field's Corner is also on the red line which is fantastic because it is a straight train to the city center and connects you to the other lines very easily. There are also stores and good eateries nearby."
The room and the house was great. Very clean,bright,comfortable and and with lots of space. There were also other guests living there so the diversity was lovely - led to many great conversations!,,,
Lastly,Steve is a fantastic host - it was my first time in the city and I was immediately made to feel like a part of the family. Everyone was so nice,"warm and friendly and the hospitality was amazing. I had a very warm welcome to this city and feel very lucky to have met such lovely people. Highly recommended.\"",,,

The bedroom was comfortable with plenty of space,  while the bathroom and kitchen was both clean, modern and easy to use. The house was also only a short walk to the red line and an easy commute into the center of Boston. Would recommend both Steve and this room to friends and family."
3788075,32631950,2015-05-19,17402476,Peter,"There is a great host present in the house. Very friendly and welcoming. Many interesting people staying at the place. Close to the redline stop (there is a shortcut to get to the house, but that will be explained to you). Quiet area. Kitchen, bathroom: basic, shared with others but is OK. Good wifi connection"

The neighborhood felt quiet and safe, even when I was walking home at 11pm or leaving for South Station at 5am.  The house itself is big, and I happened to be there when many other guests were coming and going."
3788075,35273787,2015-06-16,33152143,Carla,"Steve was a very kind host and was very good with responding to questions inquires in a timely manner. The neighborhood seemed safe.  Even though Steve was not there when I first arrived, he had another guest assist me which was very helpful. The privacy of the room was great and was quiet, I did not have to worry about noisy guests. The house was clean as well as the room. I had a great two nights there and would come back if possible."
"Thanks Steve! \"",,,,,
3788075,35442369,2015-06-18,14041306,Courtney,"\"The host assigned to the property by Steve was very nice and accomodating. He was especially interested in me seeing the neighborhood, so he sort of pushed me into taking a walking tour of the area. Not particularly welcomed after a very, very long travel and work day, but I know he meant well. The bedroom is awesome as is the bed. Everything you need to be comfortable. There was another guest who was \"\"sick\"\" and basically took over the living room and television for the night I was there. Perhaps if Steve was there"
3788075,36804495,2015-07-01,23890915,Amy,"Its my first experience on airbnb,and luckily that Steven is a nice,talkive and helpful (URL HIDDEN) was a nice stay there and it is convenient to red line."
3788075,38239326,2015-07-13,31600177,Alexander,"Even though I never met Steve, he made sure that I was taken care of from start to end and kept the lines of communications open. The room was clean, spacious and welcoming."
3788075,39436655,2015-07-23,34476277,Matthew,Steve was an extremely welcoming and accommodating host. Happy to chat any time and suggest places and restaurants to visit. The house was wonderful and extremely well taken care of and maintained. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet and the atmosphere was fantastic. Being so close to a major train station made getting into and out of Boston a breeze at any time of day and the walk to and from the house was minutes. An all-round excellent place to stay!
3788075,41297967,2015-08-05,31855786,Tiggy,Place was great! Really nice other guests. Never met Steve but it was very easy getting in and out.
3788075,45042881,2015-08-30,39258111,Jennifer,"Steve and Salif were both so easy to communicate with and were extremely helpful in my arrival and departure. Salif helped me carry by bag upstairs, was friendly, inviting and help show me around the house. Steve was there for any questions - I'd missed him but chatted with him a bunch so it made everything more comfortable. The room was great. Comfortable bed, clean sheets, air conditioning, a good amount of space and a safe environment. I enjoyed meeting everyone in the house and would highly recommend Steve's place to anyone traveling in the area. I did have a rental car and was able to get around that way. I'm not sure of the public transportation in the area but it doesn't seem too far from downtown."
3788075,80072777,2016-06-16,76750130,Benjamin,"Steve was incredibly helpful and pleasant. Met me at the door, showed me around, gave me dinner suggestions and troubleshooted a booking issue. Thanks Steve!"
3788075,81425037,2016-06-23,44738729,Shivani,"Steve' house is very conveniently located on the red line. That is very useful to get around anywhere in Boston once you get a Charlie card (which is very cheap, we think). The other occupants were very friendly and made us feel very comfortable. Steve is also very helpful and is a great host. He was also at the accommodation every morning which was helpful in case you need any help/advice. We would highly recommend this place to everyone looking for an accommodation that is good value for money."
3788075,84186324,2016-07-05,80777603,Brooke,"Steve was an excellent host! Even though we arrived a couple hours early, while they were still cleaning and setting up, they were very welcoming and invited us in to stow our belongings before we headed into Boston. Steve provided helpful tips and suggestions for how to get around and what to see. The room was comfortable and we felt very at home. Definitely recommend staying here if you are traveling to Boston!"
3788075,87213067,2016-07-19,57891567,Marcus,Steve was very responsive and helpful throughout the stay.  The place was hostelish.  The other rooms in the house were also rented so the house was full of other travelers.  This isn't really what we expected but not necessarily a bad thing.  Bathroom was a bit dirty.
3788075,88295292,2016-07-24,71365143,Brian,Steve was a great host! I liked the place - it reminded me of European pensions I have stayed in. The room was quite large. There were also a lot of brochures and books on the local area. I was happy to hear we had kitchen privileges but I did not carve out the time to cook lobster! The place is conveniently located near the T train that goes into Boston. Note: The area is fine in the day but definitely sketchy at night. I was traveling with my two teenage daughters and preferred the inexpensive uber back at night.
3788075,89399935,2016-07-28,85197036,Duong,"Steve was so nice to me, my mom and sister. He has a futon that can be converted into a bed so we, 3, can sleep comfortable in 1 room. Room has TV with cable. Internet is fast. We didn't use the kitchen since we wanted to enjoyed the food outside. I had some mosquito bites, other than that, the room was perfect to me."
3788075,89881946,2016-07-30,80368306,Jianli,"非常好的房东,房间干净整洁,房东热情好客,一个理想的旅游休息之地。"
3788075,90838711,2016-08-02,2165412,Joel,"Steve was incredibly accommodating, especially given our crazy schedule. The house was nice and cozy, exactly as shown and described. Had absolutely no issues and couldn't have asked for a nicer stay. When we got up they had some croissants for us and made good conversation before we hit the road. They gave us a number of cool places to visit in Boston. I highly recommend Steve's place to anyone passing through the area."
3788075,92554533,2016-08-09,5225646,Christopher,"Steve was very friendly. And a great communicator, very responsive. Our room was very nice, fit our needs perfectly. Although the bathrooms were shared, and the house was full, we never had to wait. We enjoyed the international feel, since several exchange students are there -- kudos to Steve for his efforts and dedication in providing them with a nice place to live at a very reasonable price. The location was great, only a few minutes walk to the red line (fields corner). We also found a great pizza place nearby. And we enjoyed the economic and cultural diversity of the neighborhood - a nice working class one. Thanks again Steve"
3788075,94274014,2016-08-15,1887091,Britton,"These guys have thought of everything. Each room has it's own key, communal bathroom. Really comfortable beds. Made it easy to find, get in and get out. We only stayed one night but will stay longer on our next trip. Beautiful home as well."
8319253,50810658,2015-10-14,22424178,Rochella,"Edith and Albert were amazing hosts!! Everything was so clean and my room was so comfortable. It was minutes from the bus stop and in a great location. They made sure I was well taken care of and from check in to check out, everything went so smoothly. I will definitely stay with them again whenever I come back to Boston."
8319253,51402282,2015-10-19,46107329,Rick,"We booked this room in the city to attend our daughter's college Parents Weekend. Upon arrival around 5pm we were presently greeted by Albert as Edith was away at the Cape. The room is on the third floor of a newly refinished three family home with the AirBnB rooms on the third floor. The house was filled with a not so pleasant cooking odor that made my spouse feel nauseous during our brief check-in time, about an 1.5 hours, before heading back out for dinner. The space was adequately appointed with most needs for a brief stay. The hosts even put out an ice bucket, soda, juice drinks, and some fresh fruit which was appreciated. The bathroom was very clean and included some shampoo and body wash in case you needed some. Our room was at the end of the hall behind a self made louvered door with padlock. Albert professed he was not a carpenter and built the 'door' himself. This entry was lockable on the inside but not totally private for a romantic evening. The room included a very nice AC unit, dresser, clothes rod, and queen size bed. The comfort level of the bed was C+ as it made a paper/plastic crinkle sound when you rolled over. The headboard was amateurly fashioned to the bed frame and may have contributed to the problem. All in all the room was adequate. One other issue we had was a chirping CO detector. Upon our return to the room we happened to bump into Albert on his way to work and again he very presently greeted us. We made our way up to the room and heard this chirping after settling into bed around 11:30pm. Not being able to fall asleep due to the louvered door I got up to investigate. I discovered the CO detector alarm was going off and called Albert. He graciously left work and came back to the house! We determined it was the batteries and confirmed the issue with a second detector. He gave us the second detector for our room to ease my spouse's concern we might not wake up in the morning. This little unexpected event had us up to about 12:45am as I troubleshooted the issue for Albert. All in all it turned out to be a non-event. In summary we had a great time in the city and the centrally located room made our visit most accommodating. We could have done without the cooking odors and night time electrical project. Dead batteries are not really Albert's fault per se as these things happen. This stay due to the issues we experienced we barely tolerable as the room cost was over $200 which is overpriced for what we experienced. For $100 I wouldn't think twice about going back to stay at this location. Albert has learned from our experience and I am positive those who come after us will have a better experience than we did. My rating is based only upon..."

1) shower pressure was very very slow.,,,,,
"2) this home was located next to trash chute and smell was awful. I hated this part.\"",,,,,

He even built a guidance that helped us to know how to use the wifi, where to park the cars and etc.  Besides, the house is very beautiful and the furniture is new!  I will definitely come again if I need renting house in Boston in the future!"
6317446,34739864,2015-06-11,22783256,Ngo,Jason's place is the nicest and most professional Airbnb we have ever been too.

6317446,35424554,2015-06-18,35486471,Sandra,"This was our first AirBnb experience and it couldn't have been better. The apartment was as nice, if not better, than the photos indicated. Jason was very attentive to our needs. If your travel plans take you to South Boston, this is the place to stay!"
6317446,36037097,2015-06-24,34405542,Bruce,"Our family of 4 enjoyed the apt for 3 days of touring Boston. Jason is a fantastic host. He's incredibly responsive (by text, email, phone), detail oriented, and professional. He provides clear and detailed instructions and recommendations. The apt is just as described in the listing and photos. It's a beautiful apt in brand new condition (June 2015). It is comfortable, fully-stocked, and well-located. We enjoyed the South Boston neighborhood and one of the neighborhood restaurants recommended by Jason.  Mostly, we used it as home base for touring historic Boston.  All of the major sights are conveniently accessible by Uber (10-15 minutes) and Logan Airport is just 15 minutes away. I have only positive feedback regarding our experience. 5 stars."
6317446,37273569,2015-07-05,17040993,Eugenio,"We were very happy to stay on this place, the apartment was wonderful, warm, charming, with everything that you could need, completely new and as is presented on the web."

Checkin and checkout process was extremely easy. The laundry machine was also useful. Overall,I had no complaints about the pad. Kitchen had all he plates and cups we needed and there were toiletries available for us.,,,,
Lastly,"the pizza place across the street had some amazing pizza. \"",,,,
6317446,40339823,2015-07-30,7068093,Mieke,"Great, brand new apartment, just as advertised. very comfortable. Jason is a quick communicator and responses immediately upon any questions. Location a bit far from downtown, but with a 15 minute Uber taxi ride you are at Haymarket. We greatly recommend having a sailing trip with Janson's dad Larry, who is not only a great host, but also knows a lot about Boston history."
6317446,40965846,2015-08-03,37839598,Yvonne,"This apartment was absolutely beautiful and everything was in perfect working order. It was exceptionally clean and the beds were so, so comfortable. Unfortunately our mornings started a little earlier than we would have wished, due to the quite loud movements of the upstairs occupants, so hopefully a friendly word from Jason could rectify this. It was easy to find and there were no issues getting in (apart from my sister being awful with a set of keys !) The neighbourhood had a very safe feel, although it didn't necessarily have any attractions itself. We would have preferred if we had been a little closer to the city centre, so we could pop back during the day, especially seeing as the apartment was so nice to be in. However taxis were very reasonably priced and the bus went from right outside the apartment, though the red line is a solid 15 minutes walk away, so that did feel like a bit of a trek when we were taking it. Jason was extremely efficient replying to any queries I had from the moment I booked. I would most definitely recommend this apartment to anyone staying for a few days.  Jason and his family clearly know how to keep 5 star accommodation."
6317446,41410972,2015-08-07,37730250,Steve,Apartment was fantastic.  Exactly as advertised.  Jason was super attentive and willing to help.  Neighborhood was beautiful.  Overall a fantastic trip and apartment.

Jason made checkin and checkout easy and it was no problem to store our bags for later travel. Take comfortable walking shoes as it's about a 15 minute walk to the nearest train station. Uber was a convenient alternative as they were always just a few minutes away.\""
6317446,44817908,2015-08-29,39970085,Rob,"Jason was very welcoming, accommodating and professional. A detailed information package was provided giving lots of great info on the neighbourhood. The apartment is as beautiful as the photos depict. Everything is brand new and the unit was spotless. Beds were super comfortable. The location was perfect for us, located close to transit to downtown, and close to the harborwalk and U Mass Boston. Some great local restaurants were nearby. We hope to stay there again and highly recommend this unit."

6317446,49954062,2015-10-07,45502689,Mohan,Jason was a great host. He left great instructions and was very tentative when we reached out to him. The place was very clean and about a 10-15 min walk from the red line.
6317446,50147194,2015-10-09,2898128,Xi,We booked this apartment two days prior to our arrival at Boston.Thanks Jason for your offer and coming to show us at late night how to enter the doors along with your lovely Teddy!My son really likes Teddy!The apartment is more than nice and the highlight is the outer balcony for us to enjoy coffee time.Highly recommended to all my friends and their family wish to stay in Boston!

The apartment is beautiful,well furnished and just as described. The neighbourhood is wonderful with lots of shops and eateries. We found several great restaurants recommended by Jason. (Blue Dragon and Lincoln Tavern and Restaurant) We stayed a couple of days after a business trip,"but would enjoy coming back to Boston and staying in Jason's place again.\"",,,
6317446,53742164,2015-11-12,30932532,Sarah,"The apartment was beautiful, even better than it looks in the photos. Extremely clean and well presented. The bedrooms are spacious and well appointed. Jason was great at communicating with us during the booking process and prior to our arrival. The check-in process was extremely easy and hassle-free, with the keys in a lock box at the front door when we arrived. The apartment is in a nice street in South Boston with some good bars and restaurants around but is about a 2-3km walk into the main city centre. This was fine for us as we enjoy walking but if you're not up for the walk you may need to catch a cab as the metro station was also quite a distance away."
"The apartment had a lovely view of the city from the lounge area which was a nice surprise. I would highly recommended this apartment for those looking to stay in the South Boston area.\"",,,,,
6317446,54017594,2015-11-15,47579780,Kenissa,The condo is absolutely beautiful and the pictures are identical to how it looks. It is a quiet area that is centrally located. The layout of unit itself is smaller but is very spacious and you never feel crowded. Three of us stayed in the unit and my sister and husband came to visit for a couple hours the night before we left without any issues of where to sit or feeling cramped while hanging out in the living/kitchen area. Jason was a delight to work with and I would recommend staying here in the future. He made my stay very easy and comfortable. He was very polite and quick to reply to my messages or questions. It was my first time using Airbnb and it will be hard for another host to top this experience.  He was out of town during my visit but always a quick email away. Jason's hospitality and gorgeous property made this stay memorable. I would highly recommend staying at one of Jason's properties. I know it will be the first place I look when returning to Boston in the future.
6317446,54598250,2015-11-22,15355169,Eri,Jason was a great host!!

There was plenty of room for four people. We liked South Boston a lot. First time staying in that area. There are some nice new restaurants within a few blocks which was important to us since we were there for work and we're tired at night and didn't want to have to go far. I'd definitely recommend this place if you want to be in South Boston!"

It was an easy 10-15 min walk to the convention centre. It is also a 10-15 min walk to Broadway metro/ 'T' station which makes it so easy to get to Cambridge or the Boston common area for sightseeing. It is located in the newly gentrified 'Southie' district on West Broadway hence some great popular restaurants and bars such as Loco are a 5 minute walk. The pizza place just across the road also does great cheap pizza, perfect for a snack after a late arriving flight."
The apartment itself is exactly as described. Recently renovated with brand new fittings and furniture. Cable TV and wifi work seemlessly. Also well equipped with essential toiletries and good quality linen.,,,,,
Jason was easy to communicate with,attentive and organised. He provided clear and detailed instructions on how to gain entry to the apartment well ahead of time and without need for prompting. We had some credit card issues and Jason was able to provide access to a landline phone to enable us to contact the bank.,,,,

6317446,89859672,2016-07-30,82215735,Cary,"Beautiful condo, great neighborhood with good access to public transportation if you are in Boston without a car. It was a breeze getting to the condo from the airport. Bedrooms are located back off the street which was quiet and the back outside deck area was a nice extra for enjoying an evening glass of wine. This is a comfortable walking neighborhood with plenty of amenities for all. Loved the helpful area suggestions provided by the hosts."

Patille was also always available and responsive to texts and phone calls. Overall we had a great experience staying here. The place is a bit far from downtown, however we had easy access to buses. Id book with Patille again."

10749794,70667482,2016-04-19,26199169,Aaron,"Our 3-night stay was awesome!  We didn't get to meet Mac, but he was easily available for questions.  We did have the pleasure of meeting Sean, and he was very accommodating with answers to any questions we had and filled us in on local information.  The condo was gorgeous, with new, updated everything.  An easy 8-10 minute walk to the Red Line T station and you are 4 stops away from downtown.  For myself, wife, and two kids, we had tons of space.  In a pure show of graciousness, after my son accidentally left his book when we checked out, Sean said they would mail it to us.  This place was excellent, clean, in a great neighborhood, and with great hosts.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
10749794,71500970,2016-04-25,32780312,Rosa,"The place was absolutely beautiful! Mac was very helpful and communicated with us through out to make sure we didn't need anything. He noticed it was getting warm and even offered to install a brand new AC while we were there, which I thought was very nice and thoughtful.  He provided drinks and some food which was also a very nice touch to it all."

10749794,75747270,2016-05-22,58338508,Austin,We enjoyed our stay at this apartment. The space was clean when we arrived and we were given good directions to and from around Boston. Mac was helpful with his directions
10749794,80786914,2016-06-19,68882586,Rose,"I cannot recommend this apartment highly enough! Very clean and well-maintained, it had plenty of basic necessities (so many towels!) and extras (coffee, sodas, water bottles, Apple TV, etc). In town for a conference, my friends and I had convenient access to the BCEC and public transportation. We had a minor hiccup connecting to the wireless, but Mac responded to our messages within 5 minutes and our problem was solved. All in all, we had a wonderful experience--staying here was the easiest part of our entire trip!"
10749794,81257900,2016-06-21,77362252,Susie,(URL HIDDEN)This is my first time to stay in the Airbnb and I had very good experience ! The apartment is well decorated and very clean ! It looks exactly like the photos on the website. The neighborhood is quit and I feel safe to walk at the night.
There is plenty space for four of us. The study room is the bonus for my husband so he can have this own place to work.  Mac provides every thing you need and even stocks a lot of water bottles and soft drinks in the refrigerator. The water bottle is the big plus to us.The laundry is in the basement so you have to get out of the building to enter the basement !  Overall,"I HIGHLY recommend this place for your home away from home. \"",,,,
10749794,84650302,2016-07-08,53088324,Catherine,"Mac's place was the perfect haven for our three night stay!  We were 3 adults and found this place comfortable and super clean. The location was a handy walk to the T and the neighborhood was charming (we loved the restaurant Moonshine!), even grabbed a haircut. The communication was stellar as well. Overall, after staying in close to a dozen Airbnb properties on four continents, this one was our favorite!"
10749794,85983562,2016-07-14,36237167,Pritam,This was one of the best AirBNB's so far.
The unit is even better than in pictures. It is a smart unit with all smart and modern devices. The stay was extremely pleasant and we would love to be back whenever in town.,,,,,
The massage chair is the highlight of the stay. We were very tired after a long journey and made full use of the chair for relaxing.,,,,,

10749794,86668120,2016-07-17,78334253,Don,If you are looking for a hotel experience with out the annoyances of a hotel then this is the place!  The apartment is beautiful and well appointed with every amenity you could imagine. The hosts were accurate in their description and the photos are dead on. They were responsive through email/text messaging for any questions you might have from parking to local activities. The location is a short 10 minute walk to the red line train which takes you directly downtown Boston and uber access is quick and reliable. I would stay here or in any of their other properties in a minute! it felt like being home!

Also, comfortable beds and pillows in bedrooms,  a clean bathroom with clean towels, and the massage chair go beyond expectation. It takes about 10 min to walk to the Andrew station, and a market around."

Really high quality finishes and that massage chair...quite an experiance.  AirCon very welcome (august...) and the fridge full of drinks likewise. Don't miss Dorchester Heights at the end of the road for the history and views. It was our first AirBnB booking and they could not have been more helpful. Highly recommended.  8mins to Andrew for \"\"the T\"\" (train) and less to West Broadway which is a smart high street for cafes and food and buses.\""
10749794,94375961,2016-08-15,81680950,Katherine,"My first air bnb experience, and I am now a fan!  Mac's apartment was exactly as described - very comfortable, tasteful, and quiet at night.  I contacted Mac twice before arrival - he responded within 3 minutes both time and was extremely helpful.  Strongly recommended."

The room is clean and neat. We found everything we need during our stay. To our surprise, Mac provided a lot of drink & grocery supply. The massage chair in the room is amazing, we did it every day during our stay. Thank you Mac! And to others who are going to stay in here, please do enjoy your trip!"
10749794,99363333,2016-09-04,91824082,Mellody,"Immaculate and inviting, with a responsive and genial host, don't hesitate to stay here! This was a great place to come to after full days of moving our daughter into her Southie apartment! Before I left in the morning and after getting back at night, I made a b-line to that ultra-awesome, programmable  massage chair! Do be aware: parking in Southie without getting a ticket is tricky.  Even with out best efforts, we got two, so include that into your budgeting estimate."
11275661,64257542,2016-03-01,8880518,Nnamdi,Everything was new and clean. The bldg is centrally located and easily accessible to local attractions. I enjoyed my stay and strongly recommend.

She was out working most of the time we were in so we had the large apartment to ourselves, mostly, aside from an adorable cat.  The neighborhood is super, super convenient if you have a car, which we did, but presumably also if not (the house is quite close to the T).  At the low price we paid it was probably the best deal available in the Boston area, and is certainly a good option even at the normal ~$100-150 price for a room."

We enjoyed the dumpling she shared with us, and we appreciated that Celia showed us around about the street, restaurant and transportation station. It was a great place if you are a person love walking. There are parks very close to the apartment and actually one of the largest shopping mall Neiman Marcus is only 25 minutes walk from there."

Although sleeping in the living room is usually not the most ideal situation, Celia went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable during my stay. She is also one of the sweetest people I've ever met and was always willing to answer questions or participate in a conversation. Although the building was old, the apartment was clean and close to where I was working, which was a big plus. I'd gladly return if I needed a place to stay again."

I was given a free upgrade to the guest room since nobody was staying there at the time, which was nice and warm. Ce was a fantastic host, she let me know all of the nice areas to explore and eat in Boston. She also offered many snacks and drinks for me as well!

We were provided with a map of Boston as well as a more detailed map of the surrounding area (South End NOT South Boston, we learned). We had great conversation, over local beer. And we will definitely be back! Great neighbourhood, too. Most things we wanted to see/do were within walking distance, and there were multiple nearby transit stops. Thank you, Ce, for a wicked (although too short) trip!"

1166808,37879449,2015-07-11,28477667,Xiaochen,"Ce’s place is ideal for people who come to visit the city. It’s close to subway and bus stations, and not far from major tourist spots like the Museum of Fine Art. You could make it to most tourist destinations within 30-minute-walk, if you are not in a rush and want to experience more of local life. Also, the house is located in a great neighborhood, safe, quiet, and lots of choices for food."
Ce as the host was very friendly and helpful. She’s lived here for quite a long time and could make really good recommendation of where to eat or grab a cup of coffee. She tried her best to make us feel more at home,and prepared in her home almost everything you need from bathing to cooking. I have no any doubt that with all the seasonings she has in the kitchen,I could make a very authentic Chinese dish.,,,
The downside of this place was it’s a little noisy at night. We could clearly hear the sound from the kitchen or bathroom. Another thing is that if possible,"book the guest room instead of the living room. There is no any facility to separate the living room from other public spaces. So you have to prepare to sleep directly in front of other guests and the host. This made us feel the most uncomfortable during our stay. So I would strongly suggest the host to figure out some ways to help increase the privacy of the living room.\"",,,,

Au final, le rapport qualité-prix est tout à fait bon et à condition d'être ouvert à rencontrer d'autres hôtes séjournant dans une autre chambre de l'appartement, nous recommandons cette adresse.

The outdoor  area was a perfect place to relax at the end of the day. Scott was a perfect host, available for any questions and timely responses to all questions. There were free passes left for us to visit the Museum of Science.  In addition, he made arrangements for us to store our bags at the apartment after checkout so we didn't have to carry them around downtown while waiting for our departure flight.

Restaurants are literally around the corners but yet the apartment was in a quiet street.  We also received complimentary Museum of Science tickets from Scott and we walked to the museum.  Cheer’s, Faneuil Hall, the other side of Beacon Street, Freedom Trail… are all within walking distance."
Scott’s place is nicely decorated and provided everything we need for a short stay or even longer stays.  I would recommend Scoot’s place to my friends.,,,,,

We appreciated that he trusted us with his place and it felt like we were staying at a friend's place.  The bed was comfortable and everything was clean and well maintained. It was just two of us, and so, we were able to use the dining and living room area to lay out our luggage.  Space would have been limited if we had squeezed in one more just in terms of luggage space especially if you're not a light packer.  Check in and check out were easy as well as corresponding with Scott.  We would be open to staying here again next time. Thanks!"

a.Jin was very nice. She gave me a quick walk through of the place,provided me with the wifi information and the basic rules of the room. The description was accurate on what was displayed on the site. It was a great neighborhood: had a park in front,a starbucks on the first floor or Dunkin Donuts across the street,and also had a CVS store a block away.  Overall she was great.

It was clean and fully stocked with bedlinens, towels, hairdryer, and toiletries. Fully functioning shower, toilet, air conditioning, and wi-fi! The queen bed was very comfortable for my boyfriend and me. We stayed for 2 nights."
The building is easy to locate,right next to the Boylston T station. Good to know: this results in very audible train screeching,FYI,which while dies down late at night when the T stops running it also starts up early in the morning. It's not too bad if you close the windows. Nearby,there are plenty of coffee shops and convenience stores for whatever you might need,and of course the beautiful Boston Common right outside.
"Jin was a pleasure to deal with. She was easily reached and very helpful in answering questions about parking and check-in. I wish you the best! Thanks again!\"",,,,,

Stacy had bottled water and a basket of soaps etc in the bathroom incase you forgot something.,,,,,
The beds were super comfy and the apartment was decorated very nicely .,,,,,
It is on the third floor and it's a narrow and spiral staircase. Fine for us but I imagine if you are a senior it my be a bit of a challenge with luggage.,,,,,
You may want to bring ear plugs it can be a bit noisy at night.,,,,,

El barrio es tranquilo y seguro hay opciones para comer y se puede tomar cerca un bus. June es muy amable y se aseguro que todo estuviera en orden. Lo único negativo fue en el piso de arriba vivían unos niños con un perro y hacian mucho ruido por lo que se escuchaban los pasos y la bulla pero como no pase mucho tiempo en la casa no fue mayor incomodidad."

The room is even cuter than the pictures. Very tidy with plenty of storage space. Having a desk space was so helpful,and the fan was very handy the one day it got above 80 degrees. There are 2 lamps available so it's not a lot of light in the evening,but there is plenty of natural light during the day. A nice dark curtain also makes it easy to sleep. The building and the street were in a quiet area and very safe. This was definitely something I look for as a single female traveling.

I became interested in June's apartment, through a combination of the location of the apartment, the price per night and the overwhelmingly positive and recent reviews she had received. It is primarily for this reason that I have also decided to write a review. There was excellent communication with June, prior to my arrival and during my arrival.  The apartment is situated in a nice neighbourhood in the increasingly gentrified Southie, close to the shoreline where there is nice place to run/ride or play ball games and close to the location of the wedding that I was attending, at the Seaport Hotel.  There is a main street less than 500M away with eating places and convenience stores. Getting around via uber and lyft are very convenient reliable and affordable."

4205641,32386135,2015-05-17,32097006,Mary,Octavio knows how things run on airbnb so I'm glad we had the chance to stay in his bachelor. Great set-up with minimal furniture and great backdrop of his production studio. The view of the downtown core and his super comfy (i'm not kidding) futon bed was the highlight for me!

Awesome guy to talk to about world travel, business, and technology, too. Super fun.  The view of Boston from the studio is stunning and the place has all the basic amenities one might need while visiting. Also, the studio was right across from a CVS pharmacy, which was very convenient for buying food and whatever else you might need. Grabbing an Uber or Lyft was fast and easy from where the studio is located, too. Overall, awesome experience. Thanks much, O!"

4205641,51797801,2015-10-24,5081020,Alessandro,"I arrived one day late as my flight was cancelled. The apartment was not cleaned up, as the owner did not expect me anymore (? I booked for a week and did not cancel). I waited for some hours to meet him. He quickly prepared the bed, took off with his small dog and the day after thoroughly cleaned the apartment. I was satisfied. He came back in the apartment more times, later during my staying, at least once without preventively asking me. I think he needed to work with his instruments, which are in the studio-apartment and cannot be moved. The apartment is really a sofa bed, a kitchen and a bathroom. The view is amazing. While the area is not cool at all (next to a hospital with a metadone clinic, even the taxi driver was not happy to take me there), it is not really unsafe, at least for a big guy like me. The building is definitely safe, although its inhabitants appear somewhat scary (thug looks, however normal or indifferent during interactions)."

Lots of facilities in the neighborhood. Octavio himself welcomed us and was very kind and patient during the following days."
4205641,69168527,2016-04-09,65660075,Judy,"Had a last minute booking for Boston and got the chance to stay at Octavio's wonderful apartment. It was clean, had a gorgeous view, had a refrigerator as well as a microwave to heat up our leftovers from the trip. Octavio was nice and attended to our needs. He even went out of the way to provide us with speakers to watch television on his projector, which was awesome! The timing for weather on the trip wasn't in our favor, but Octavio had the courtesy of leaving us with three umbrellas to provide us in our trip to explore Boston. The place was sufficient to address our needs and stay. It was comfortable and felt very homelike. He is an excellent host as well as a great human being! Coming from California, 30-40 degree weather wasn't that great... But the heater was amazing and kept the trip comfortable. Great place to stay in to relax and to explore the city. Walking distance from a CVS, various food places, coffee shops, and public transportation. This was an excellent place to stay at and thank you for your hospitality, Octavio!"
4205641,70118758,2016-04-16,13725657,Franck,"Octavio a été sympa, cependant, pendant la location il m'a envoyé un message pour me dire qu'il arrivait dans 3 minutes (sans me demandais si ça me dérangeait, si je dormais, si j'étais occupé) puis un autre me disant qu'il allait resté 30 minutes (sans mon accord, toutes mes affaires étaient sorties, papiers, ordi, argent) alors que je devais quitter l'appartement le lendemain, il n'a meme pas attendu une demi journée pour venir chercher les affaires qu'il voulait prendre. C'est un peu désagréable"
4205641,70623316,2016-04-19,20641767,Sergio,Muy buena experiencia en el studio de Octavio. Tiene todo lo necesario y está bien conectado con el centro en bus. El anfitrión estuvo muy atento en todo momento ante cualquier duda que pudiera surgir.
4205641,70763140,2016-04-20,26100235,Hugh,The room was pleasant and attractive and Octavio was a gracious host. Would stay there again.

My friend and I arrived slightly late, but Octavio was kind enough to wait for us, and show us how everything in his apartment worked. His place has an amazing view, and was the perfect spot to rest my head in between busy days in Boston!"
4205641,71661205,2016-04-27,593123,Jess,Octavio was a great host and available nearby if I needed anything. There was a wonderful view of Boston from the studio. And being able to watch Game of Thrones on the huge projector screen was quite a treat.  A $2.10 bus leaves every ten minutes from a few blocks away and gets to downtown Boston in 15 minutes or so. Great spot!
4205641,71924874,2016-04-29,27367145,Debora,"Octavio's place is nice with a beautiful view, everything was as described and there was all we may need for our staying. Also, the check in was smooth and Octavio was helpful and kind, he also let us leave our luggage before the check in time and gave us good tips. A very good experience overall and for a very good price considering the average in Boston!. Perhaps the neighborhood is not fancy but it s still okay and safe. The location is pretty good altough not super central, however you can see it before booking and Boston is walkable, in 25 minutes walking you re downtown."
It was a good deal and I'd recommend it,"thank you Octavio!\"",,,,
4205641,72677363,2016-05-04,63558755,Fan,"Octavio was a good host.  He waited for me to get in, even though it was very late into the night.  I was only there for about 5 hours but overall no complaints."
4205641,72914215,2016-05-05,29926162,Kirk,Octavio's apartment was just like he described it in the ad. An artist's studio.
It was my first time in that part of Boston,"and I can't say that I am impressed. I am leaning towards the \"\"unimpressed\"\" side.",,,,
The view was great,"the apartment was OK. Maybe I am getting too old and I can't recognize what is \"\"hip\"\" and what is unacceptable any more.",,,,
The place is old and needs TLC,and I will leave it at that.,,,,
It offers not much but a place to sleep,but considering the prices of regular hotels in Boston this time of the year,it was a bargain.,,,
Building is safe. Neighborhood,not so much...,,,,
It can be a very nice and very successful AIRBNB place,but it needs a lot of work.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4205641,73306514,2016-05-08,69036313,Zachary,"I can't emphasize enough what a positive experience the stay with Octavio was. This is a beautiful, well-kept space at an incredibly affordable price in range of everywhere we wanted to go in the city. Everything we needed was provided, and he really went the extra mile to make it a great weekend. Great guy, too!"
4205641,74111122,2016-05-13,37826495,Vanessa,"Nice, bright apartment that had everything I needed.  Nice bathroom and having a little kitchen was great.  Octavio was very responsive and helpful."
4205641,75035959,2016-05-18,68251999,Rob,"Octavio was very accommodating and flexible with our difficult travel schedule. He made sure the keys were available for pickup after our late flight arrived. While we were aware the AC would not be functioning, we were forced to have the windows open as it got very warm in the apartment. Being next to a medical center, there were constant sirens throughout the night which was very loud and difficult to sleeping through. The area wasn't ideal as there were usually homeless people hanging out in front of the building and even in the lobby at times. Overall, the studio was very suitable for our short stay but the environment around the apartment building caused some disturbances."
4205641,77307721,2016-05-31,20835128,Molly,"Octavio was SOOO great. He was very thoughtful in providing directions and explanations of everything in the loft. The loft was very clean and tidy and had everything we needed for a great weekend. He was extremely responsive if we had any questions, he would always respond in a timely and helpful manner. The views from the loft were awesome and it was very easy to find street parking near by. We had 4 of us in total. Two on the futon and two on the air mattress. This was perfect for what we were looking for which was really just a place to lay our heads for the weekend and have access to our own kitchen. Octavio provided lots of linens and the kitchen had what we needed to make some simple food meals. All in all it was exactly what we wanted for our memorial day girls weekend."
4205641,77795915,2016-06-03,50603049,Shakeelah,"My stay here was great. The studio is quaint but spacious, perfect for a few friends or solo traveler. The place was relatively clean, and the view is amazing!"
Octavio was very accommodating and went out of his way to ensure I had all of my needs met.  He popped in from time to time to drop something off but he always provided notice. The neighborhood is very diverse. Like the description says,if being around people who look different than you makes you weary,this might not be the place for you. I walked around the surrounding neighborhood a TON and found everyone to be very friendly. Bus stops and train stations are very close by,but you can easily walk to many attractions. Back Bay was about a 25 minute walk and MFA was 30 minutes. Overall it was great,"and I would definitely stay here again!\"",
4205641,78233111,2016-06-05,4644120,Julius,"First of all Octavio was a tremendous host. Super nice guy, had a bunch of great recommendations. He was really making sure everything went well. Unfortunately the central AC of the building wasnt turned on yet, so it got a little warm. Octavio immediately offered us a partial refund. Thanks a lot. The apartment is cozy and has  everything you need including a pretty kick ass entertainment system! The location is great, the building itself is not the most picturesque but the view is phenomenal and a few blocks away from the South End, which is really pretty.  Thanks again for the great stay in Boston!"
4205641,78870035,2016-06-09,33662460,Chris,"I agreed to meet Octavio at his apartment for the key exchange.   Octavio was prompt with communications.    The apartment itself is just as the pictures show, very sparse with furniture and has a great view.   Octavio mentioned that the building air conditioning was not going to be on during my stay but he did provide a room air conditioner which worked well.    Fortunately, the weather was not too warm so I was able to open the windows for air.     Since his place is near a hospital, there was some ambulance noise which is to be expected.   Octavio did provide ear plugs and an eye mask which was a nice touch.   The neighborhood around the apartment is not the best in town but I didn't feel the least bit unsafe.   There are good bars and restaurants within 15 minutes walking distance.   It's a 25 minute walk from the Prudential Center, so it was a nice way to end the work day.   The only issue I had with the apartment was trying to get the TV to work."
Overall,Octavio was a great host and his apartment was a great value.   After June 15,"the air conditioning should be on so that problem will go away.\"",,,
4205641,79346528,2016-06-12,66765647,Casey,Octavio's home was great. Everything was as advertised and was enjoyable place to call home for the weekend.
He has an awesome home theater and everything in it is labeled so that staying there is very easy. His place was clean and in a good location,walking distance to good food and bars.,,,,

4205641,80278272,2016-06-17,18869324,Anne,"Had a chill night in Octavio's loft near BU med center. It's an edgy, millennial artistic experience with a gorgeous view of the city and a A-plus entertainment situation. There is conveniently located - a CVS right across the street - as well as very colorful neighbors. I stayed with a girlfriend and we ubered in and out but Octavio assures the hood is 100% safe. Octavio was very responsive, kind, and helpful. The futon bed was much softer and more comfortable than I expected. Soft sheets too. Floors were sticky so bring slippers. Octavio thoughtfully provides eye masks which were needed because of his huge window in the morning. We could not figure out the tech between the 5 remote controls and whatnot but Octavio came over and turned on the Netflix for us :). What a nice host."
4205641,80720397,2016-06-19,8863652,John Paul,Octavio was responsive by text.  The building is pretty rough.
4205641,81433625,2016-06-23,6045719,Kerilyn,"Octavio was very helpful, even offering us his own personal dog food for our pup if it was needed! Location was nice, and parking was easier than expected. There are some great restaurants in the area and if you feel like traveling outside of this part of town it is just as easy to grab the public transportation or an uber."
4205641,81549639,2016-06-23,77975429,Lydia,The apartment was exceptionally clean and well maintained. The view was really nice. It is a bit bright in the morning but the host provided us with sleeping masks which was thoughtful.
4205641,82729794,2016-06-29,41499091,Preeti,Octavio's place is a great one. Amazing view and location. It has all the amenities. Octavio communicated with us very well and made sure that our stay went swiftly. The only issue we had was with the floors. They were sticky so bring slippers along.
4205641,83029187,2016-06-30,24943932,David,This is a nice place with a great view in a convenient location. Octavio was very communicative and it was easy to check in and find where to go.

4205641,85832173,2016-07-13,9572594,Allison,Octavio was a great host. Very accommodating and made my stay very easy! The apartment itself is as described (and the view is amazing!) but the apartment building is a bit noisy and unnerving to walk in and out of at night alone as a woman.
4205641,86727520,2016-07-17,76941587,George,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4205641,89030129,2016-07-26,18684679,Katie,I really appreciated the communication that Octavio provided throughout the trip. It was my first AirBnb experience and I was a little nervous about how it would all work out.
The place is exactly as described. Clean,simple and a really nice view of the city. The big screen projector/TV was really fun too. One of the other things that made me feel a little nervous were the review from people that said there was a lot of riff raff in the area. There were a few people hanging out across the street but everyone minded their own business. I arrived back late at night each evening and did not feel scared or nervous.,,,,
"I especially appreciated his flexibility when my flight got delayed. He allowed me to check out a little later than I originally requested.\"",,,,,

But honestly, we cannot fit in the studio comfortably, as we felt it would appropriate for only 2 person . Moreover, we love to eat together around a table but it was not provide. The view from the flat is amazing it is really worst  to see!"
4205641,91469949,2016-08-05,77312858,Matt,"Me and my girlfriend stayed for one week at the studio. It is exactly as described. Octavio is a great communicator. We arrived very late and he welcomed us personally. The studio has 2 highlights: The really great city views and the projector home cinema with Apple TV. The location/ building is perhaps not the most upmarket one, but we enjoyed our stay and felt at all times safe. It is a great place to explore the Southend, approximately 12-15 min. by foot to Mass Av station and roughly 30 min by foot to Prudential. Lots of nice restaurants around. I would definitely stay there again!"
4205641,94673958,2016-08-16,86758459,Toni,"This was my first airbnb experience. Octavio did what he could to help.

4205641,99181890,2016-09-03,45949234,Christopher,A very comfortable studio apartment in a reasonably accessible part of Boston. Octavio was very welcoming and helpful.
4205641,99581936,2016-09-05,46995041,Whitney,Octavio was accessible and easy to communicate with prior to my arrival. The neighborhood was central to pretty much everything you'd want to visit in Boston. I stayed one night because I was attending a concert at TD Garden which was a very cheap uber ride away from his place. If I were to return to Boston I would definitely consider Octavio's place and bring some friends along as there was more than enough room for one. The view was awesome and the smart amenities such as the speakers and projector added a nice touch.
4205641,99801285,2016-09-06,65496379,Paul,"Very nice studio apartment.  Well equipped and a fantastic view of downtown.  It is an older neighborhood and a little rough, but nothing bad.

The location is very convenient to the large convention center; if you are in town for a conference at the BCEC, Leo's place is a bare 5 minute walk over. The apartment was very clean and plenty of bedding and towels were left out for us."

My friend and I were able to check-in as soon as our plane landed. The apartment is in a great location, very close to public transportation and great bars and restaurants. It was a great space, very clean and new! We loved our stay! When we arrived, Leo was able to provide suggestions for where we could visit which was a great help. He also allowed us to extend our stay a few hours to take in all the sights. Overall, we had a great experience, loved the apartment, and Leo was a very friendly and accommodating host!"

A close walk to great seaport restaurants, the apartment was just perfect for me. It was tidy, modern, and had everything I needed. Leo was flexible and easy to communicate with and had great instructions for using the amenities in the flat. No problems at all. I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely love to stay again next time I am in Boston. Thanks Leo!"
8366402,75728755,2016-05-22,57462022,Ashley,"We had an amazing trip to Boston!  Leo's appartment was just as described and an excellent place to stay.  Very clean, had all the amenities we could have wanted.  Leo met us there upon our arrival and we had immediate access.  Location was great, we were able to take the Silver Line (for free) from the airport, got off at World Trade Center stop and only had a short walk to the appartment.  Many great restaurants and things to do in Seaport and South Boston and also close enough to walk to many other areas.  All in all - highly recommeded!"
8366402,76943198,2016-05-29,8337744,Michael,Leo's apartment is very welcoming and perfectly maintained.  We loved having a Nespresso machine which saved us from having to go out for coffee.  It is conveniently located near the silver line as well as a short walk to the many restaurants on the South Seaport Wharf.
The building is in a quiet and safe area and a short uber ride to anywhere you don't feel like walking or taking transit (both of which are very convenient).,,,,,
"Leo left very clear instructions and check-in/check-out were very easy.  I would highly recommend Leo's apartment for anyone who would like a nice place to stay in Boston.\"",,,,,

I could go on.  If you are in need of a place to stay near the convention center, this is it! Thank you, Leo, for your gracious hospitality!"
8366402,87699744,2016-07-21,3501350,Huy,Leo was pleasant and helpful in his communication. The location was convenient and clean. I would stay here again.

Susan was really helpful for everything I asked her and very kind.,,,,,
It's a bit far from down town but really well public transportation,20 minutes in 36 bus and then you have the subway and you can go anywhere.,,,,
A very safe neighbourhood as well and like i said well communicated.,,,,,
I absolutely recommend you this place.,,,,,
Thanks Susan.,,,,,
Un buen lugar para quedarse en Boston,muy limpio y tranquilo.,,,,
Un poco lejos del centro pero un autobus te lleva al metro en 20 minutos,no muy bueno si quieren estar muy muy tarde en la ciudad,pero en general un buen lugar.,,,
Susan fue muy amable y me ayudo con mis dudas,,,,,
Lo recomiendo.,,,,,

What I got was an amazing hotel-quality experience that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for an extraordinary place to stay in the Boston area. Should I ever return to the area, I fully expect that I will try staying here again. Thanks for everything, Susan!"

13261681,93566995,2016-08-13,86954603,Cindy,"This is the first time I have used Airbnb and it was a great experience! Susan 's place is very clean and Convenient - less than 5 minute walk to bus stop. She is very helpful by providing information on Boston locals, transportations etc. The breakfast is nice and we enjoyed it, one morning she even made us  a dish with fresh cucumbers picked from her gorgeous garden! Communication is great too -- we can communicate in both English and Chinese."
13261681,98959189,2016-09-02,90444466,Florencia,This was my first experience with Airbnb so I wasn't sure what to expect. I have to say I was satisfied. I went to Boston for 6 days with a colleague to take a course in the Longwood medical area.
Susan was a very polite host. She was flexible enough to let us check in about an hour earlier than the established check in time.,,,,,
As soon as we arrived she explained to us the means of transportation that were convenient for us. Also she lent us a Charlie card to be able to charge credit on it and pay for the subway and bus fares. She gave us a map of the subway lines and the schedule for the 36 bus.,,,,,
The room was what I expected from seeing the pictures on Airbnb. The beds were very comfortable and wide and me and my colleague were able to get good nights of sleep. The house has central air conditioning so the room was fresh in the hot summer days in which we visited Boston.,,,,,
The bathroom was next to our room which made it very comfortable. Though the bathroom was shared with the room across the hall,it was always clean and we didn't even notice it was being used by other people.,,,,
The neighbourhood is quiet and there are some shops a couple of blocks away (supermarket,italian restaurant and pizzeria,Dunkin donuts). There is also a bus stop about 2 min (2 blocks) away from Susan's house. This bus (number 36) took us to the Forrest Hills subway station (aprox. 20 min ride) which allowed us to take the orange line and combine with other lines as well.,,,
The only drawback is that the 36 bus had quite a low frequency (1 bus every 20 min or so).,,,,,
"When we booked this room we already knew that it was quite far away from the Longwood medical area which was where the venue for our course was. We still chose to stay at Susan's because the place seemed nice and the price was convenient.\"",,,,,

6568621,48018174,2015-09-22,41828013,Erin,"\"The Apartment was not as pictured.  There were dents in the walls, burn holes in the carpet and quite a few items were not working properly.  We tried to use the vacuum and after turning it on it broke.  The pictures are deceiving and the Apartment building was nothing like we expected.  We were traveling on business and would not stay here again, especially for the price we paid.  We were expecting something much cleaner and not as \"\"used\"\".\""
6568621,48604930,2015-09-27,43548076,Mark,Thanks for a great stay Mike. We appreciate your flexibility and positive response to our change in travel plans. The apartment staff is very friendly and the property is well suited to those looking for something closer to a hotel experience.
Finally -  if you are in town to see some baseball,"you certainly can't beat the location - it's a five minute walk to Fenway Park.\"",,,,

6568621,57818783,2015-12-29,10980487,Kevin,Nice apartment. Easy to check in. The apartment you get is different from the pictures. Some of the window shades were broken. The light in the kitchen was broken. It was fixed soon after we called. Other things are fine. The location is very good.
6568621,65889012,2016-03-17,59531617,Tiana,"Mike's place is so good. It's spacious and comfortable. It's not far away from BU. The neighbors are all really kind. The only problem is we don't find the grease pump in the kitchen, so the alarm went on for a few times. Anyway, that's the best airbnb experience we have."
6568621,79407071,2016-06-12,72376493,Jasmine,"The apartment is exactly the same as the picture. It's very comfortable for four people to live in. And ChurchHill is a really responsible agency. At first, there is only one key left on the kitchen table, but immediately after we called ChurchHill, they sent another one. However, the shower in one of the rooms was not able to be used but we did not call the ChurchHill to fix it because we thought we could handle it by using only one shower in the other room. The location is amazing-- once we walked out, there is a target right beside the apartment, a grocery store opposite to it, a cinema at the back side, and many restaurants and coffee shops options. My friends and I are really pleased to stay in this apartment for ten days to do our test prep. It was an amazing experience and helped release a lot of our pressure through intensive exams."
6568621,91647956,2016-08-06,83598550,John,"Listing description was not accurate and was not what we ended up with. The room accommodations and the amenities were lacking, broken, missing, and not offered. I would not stay with Churchill again."

Flat was beautiful, we had our own screened-off area of the lounge on the comfiest mattress of our entire trip, and there was a manual pinned to the fridge with answers to any questions we might have had. Best AirBnB experience yet!"
8662258,50232021,2015-10-10,18715584,Basia,Amanda is nice and friendly person. We enjoy our stay at her place. Her home is quite small but very charming and clean.

"Amanda was a wonderful and lovely  host: She really took care about everything and gave us good tipps to explore the city. She couldn't have done more to make it a perfect weekend in Boston!

8662258,51350811,2015-10-19,44859834,Aret,Amanda's place is conveniently located near the public transportation. I took the bus from New York and it was really easy to get to from there. Her place is nice & tidy and she helped set up our place to sleep in. She was also very accommodating and was very prompt with her response every time I have an inquiry. I highly recommend Amanda to anyone looking for a place in Boston--her place is lovely and so is she. It's a win-win situation!
8662258,51500951,2015-10-20,26657955,Rikki,"I had never visited Boston before, so it was quite an experience for me! I didn't really know what to expect when arriving at Amanda's place. I'm glad I asked her beforehand about parking, because there is literally none except for resident permit parking. She directed me toward the Boston Common parking, which was very convenient. I absolutely loved the location of her apartment, and although small, was very cozy. After Amanda rang me in, a small flight of stairs takes you directly to her apartment, where she greeted me and welcomed me in early to drop off my bags. It's quite nosy late into the evening and early in the morning, but other than that, it's a great overnight stay!"

Amandas set up has you living in the kitchen/livingroom,which could be frustrating but Amanda makes it a very cosy with paper screens to shield of and create some privacy.,,,,

The house is very clean and cozy, and all basic amenities are provided. Amanda was an amazing host who made our stay as comfortable as possible. We had to check-in earlier and check-out later than the listing stated, and Amanda was not only accommodating to our requests, but each night we returned from a long day of sightseeing, she would already have the living area set up for our convenience. Communication was outstanding as well throughout the trip. Overall, we had a great experience and would highly recommend Amanda and her place to anyone who is looking to stay in the Boston area."

I was a bit anxious approaching the residence as I can't see the house number in the dark,I arrived at 7PM and was communicated to the host before arrival.  I am thankful for Sally and Bruce for accommodating me for that particular time as I was able to attend my conference with a last minute decision. The place is just 2 blocks to the bus line which will bring you to all access in the city of Boston,"close to Harvard and major hospitals.\"",,,

Sally really was a wealth of information and she was so generous when I was running late for my race waiting for a can she gave me a lift. Darwin the cat is super sweet and adorable.  Great neighborhood and location. I'd stay again.
3012529,24600102,2014-12-31,4227716,Stephanie,"We had a fantastic time staying with Bruce and Sally.  They are wonderful people and helped us a lot in getting around and finding fun things to do in Boston.  They even loved our 3 1/2 month old baby and had a pac n play and high chair we could use for her.  The accommodations were great.  They provided towels, fridge space, etc. and let us use the kitchen to make food and avoid eating out every meal.  They are close to the commuter rail that goes anywhere in Boston so it was easy to get around.  They are about 4 miles from Boston Common so you will most likely need to use the train to get to the tourist sites, but it comes every 5 to 7 minutes so it's super convenient."

Beeing my first time using Airbnb and coming from a foreign country i came to boston looking for a place to stay while i was looking for a permanent house and in the process i ended up finding a couple of great friends that make me feel as confortable as at home. Great location,"close to the T line. Easy to visit universities and also to go to downtown. They are a very helpfull couple and its very interesting to share moments and conversations with them. My stay in Boston was memorable thanks to them.\"",,,,

They were very amicable hosts who were genuinely interested in making sure we had a great stay in Boston.   The house was very clean and cozy.  The rooms were excellent and the layout was lovely. We enjoyed playing with the friendly and cute cat Darwin who purs in contentment when you stroke his head and he tried his best to sleep with all of us in turn.  Our only regret is that we only stayed for 1 night, as we really enjoyed the place.  It also provided the best sleep I have had in weeks.  I would definitely recommend Sally & Bruce as your hosts in Boston."

Sally and Bruce were awesome as usual, as they replied to our reservation request on short notice really promptly and allowed us to settle our travel plans early.  Nothing had changed about the rooms and our hosts had carefully prepared fresh towels again for us. It was as pleasant as ever, but sadly we did not get to see Darwin the cat again.  We really love the place and it has to be up there with our best Airbnb experiences ever!"
3012529,27816033,2015-03-12,22523018,Madelon,Bruce and Sally were welcoming. Bruce kindly shoveled a path through the snow to the next door neighbors who we were visiting. The bed and overall accommodations were very comfortable and Sally and Bruce were delightful hosts.

3012529,29776752,2015-04-12,17735842,Lisa,"There is no street parking available after 4pm, so if you have a car we suggest not staying here.  We feared all night that we would get a ticket a couple blocks away.  The house was old and very unkempt even the outside porch railings were old and rusty. The place was extremely cluttered, not condusive at all to having guests. The outside porch was stacked to the ceiling with boxes and even an old mattress and we had to walk through a path to get to the door to the house.  The place was very small, especially the bedrooms, and old with no updated anything at all; no real doors on the bedrooms; they have accordian heavy plastic doors so privacy is limited.  The bathroom we had to use was shared by everyone including the owners.  Cat little box was next to toilet, bathroom was very old and not kept up, grime all around tub, all around dirty feeling.  Their house cat was allowed in guest rooms, even if we did not want it to.  Overall an uncomfortable stay."

Both were easy to talk to and answered any questions I had.I felt comfortable in their home as we were allowed to come and go as we pleased. The location was ideal for me with only a 10 minute walk to the T green line. Whole Foods was just a block or so away. I will definitely stay with Sally & Bruce again when I return  to the Boston area.
3012529,30612532,2015-04-25,2557012,Tami,"Sally and Bruce's place has a really homey atmosphere, in a nice, quiet neighbourhood near the Boston University that felt very safe, and was about a 20 min ride on the T to downtown Boston. Sally or Bruce were always around to answer questions and provide help, such as with using the washer and dryer. Although the toilet was shared with the hosts and another guest, it was always clean and convenient to use. A Whole Foods is located 5 mins away, so it was very convenient to grab breakfast at the start of the day, and groceries before heading back."

The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. The room was as shown,small but very comfy,esp. the comforter on the bed. It is within easy walking distance to Wholefoods which is a plus for me. I felt at home and relaxed when I got there. A wonderful place right on the marathon route too.,,,

3012529,46752766,2015-09-13,40794151,Christina,"Bruce was very welcoming - he was also very helpful in giving me directions on how to get back into downtown (which is about a 30+ minute ride on the green line. So if being near downtown is what you're looking for, this may not be the right location for you). They also had a communal metro card that was already pre-loaded with enough money to get to where I was going (they had just asked for me to reload it with what I had used up). Unfortunately I had to cut my stay short - but they were both very accommodating about it."
3012529,46854133,2015-09-13,30452123,Lisa,It's really authentic stay experience. Very clean comfortable house and convenient  transportation. Will definitely come back. Highly recommended
3012529,47051799,2015-09-15,7136533,Marie,Friendly hosts with lots of information for you and happy to tell you.  Super location.

3012529,47534690,2015-09-20,43281509,Chris,Sally was absolutely awesome. She helped us out quite a bit with directions and different information. Room was great and very clean. Allowed us to do our laundry and even gave me a good tip about laundry. I wish we were able to have spent more time here.
3012529,47645086,2015-09-21,36818317,Maria,"Sally and Bruce were very friendly. Sally gave us lots of directions and additionally they left in our bedroon many brochures and a guide with information about Boston. They answered anything we asked and also recommended places to eat in the neighborhood. They also lent us a Charlie card so that the trips by bus and metro were cheaper. The bedroom was clean and we had access to the kitchen and the rest of the house. If you're looking for a place near the city centre, maybe this is not best right location, but if you're looking for a nice and friendly stay, then this is the right place."
Special mention should also be made about Darwin,the house cat,"who basically is the boss!.\"",,,
3012529,48049780,2015-09-22,13277654,Christopher,"Excellent communications, lovely room, kind people too!"

"They went out of their way to guide us regarding getting around the city and answered all our queries patiently. They make sure you feel comfortable at all times and take good care of you. Would love to stay again with them.\"",,,,,
3012529,49131543,2015-10-01,34528593,Hans,Sally & Bruce helped us a lot to find the way to their house from the airport. We got a hearty welcome and felt really comfortable and free in their house which was a student like somewhat disorganized environment.
3012529,49361781,2015-10-03,44010593,James,"I had a really great time at Sally and Bruce's place.  They are located about 1 block from the Whole Foods in the Brighton section of Boston.  the room was just as advertised - nice and comfy.  I had a good night's sleep and the wifi was blazing fast.  Sally and Bruce were very helpful and very welcoming.   I will gladly stay there again.  The only thing to watch for is that their street address is similar to another street far away, and if one is not careful with a GPS/Uber one could wind up far away.  Make sure you have the right zip code in the GPS."
3012529,49605034,2015-10-05,33672545,Guillaume,Cet endroit était parfait pour notre séjour à Boston. Le trajet vers et depuis le centre ville se fait bien. Sally et Bruce étaient très accueillants et leur maison chaleureuse!

3012529,49990290,2015-10-08,42323431,Patty,"Sally was very welcoming and friendly when we arrived. The room was just as described and we slept great there. The neighborhood was nice and easily accessible to lots of good restaurants and interesting spots around Coolidge Corner, as well as to the T. We'd stay there again."
3012529,50124440,2015-10-09,45359605,Dee,Great location. Enjoyed my stay here. The room was clean and the bed provided was very comfortable. Sally was friendly and had great communication up until my arrival. And their cat Darwin is the cutest. The only downside was that there wasn't any street parking as mentioned in the listing. We had to drive carefully up through a narrow driveway (which barely just fit our SUV) to get to a parking spot in the back.
3012529,50322101,2015-10-11,22352375,Sara,Excellent accommodations and very friendly people!
3012529,50752950,2015-10-14,40826146,姵逸,The room is very clean. And they are very nice.can help you all of questions.The room location is near by the T the B line.This is a good choice.
3012529,50954693,2015-10-16,24882914,Johannes,"We have been there for two nights at their place and had a comfy stay. Unfortunately we only had a small chance to talk to Sally in the end, but the adorable housecat Darwin gave some company."
Parking with big vehicles could become a problem,but any regular car should fit.,,,,
"Sally & Bruce seem to live an layed back livestyle in case one would mind. We enjoyed the uncomplicated experience.\"",,,,,
3012529,51128690,2015-10-18,39155131,Amy,Sally and Bruce were very welcoming and accommodating! Bed was comfortable. Even though you share a bathroom it was never an issue. Great location with lots of restaurants nearby. Would definitely stay here again.

3012529,52719559,2015-11-01,33572433,Huey,"Sally & Bruce were the warmest AirBnb hosts we could ever ask for. They welcomed us into their home and gave us lots of amazing tips on what to do in Boston. We had plenty of interesting conversations, which was lovely!"
The room was exactly as per listing,in a cozy home and in a nice neighbourhood called Brookline. There is public transportation (T-subway) close by and there's also a reservoir for running/walking not far away at all.,,,,
"It was definitely a home away from home for us!\"",,,,,
3012529,53265479,2015-11-07,41932393,Pezhman,This is a nice place to stay and Sally and Bruce are great hosts.
3012529,53378213,2015-11-08,13582578,Mariko,"The room was warm and comfortable.  The bed was just the right firmness and came with a fabulous comforter.  Sally was very helpful giving us advice on area restaurants and transportation.  Most importantly, there was a nice parking spot waiting for our car!  The accordian door to the room wasn't as soundproof as we would have liked.  Other than that, we had a terrific stay!"
"\"",,,,,
3012529,53668880,2015-11-10,47937093,Mark,Great expirience
3012529,54007276,2015-11-15,18103047,Ludmilla,"Absolutely marvellous! Sally is this strong, determinate woman and Bruce, he is just adorable, friendly and super helpful man! I loved both of them very much like they were part of my own family. I totally recommend their home. Boston was definitely more appreciated and warmed because of those two people. Thank you very much for everything."
"...and their cat Darwin is super affectionate. :) 3\"",,,,,
3012529,54490334,2015-11-20,42009630,Mia,"I had such a wonderful stay with Sally and Bruce! Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet them, but I felt right at home immediately. Sally's directions to the place were very thorough, and my name was on the door when I arrived. My room was clean, and my bed was really comfy."
I didn't get to meet Darwin,unfortunately,"but I had a lovely stay at their Boston townhouse for the short stay I was there. Thanks to you both!\"",,,
3012529,54576159,2015-11-22,41321371,Angelique,"Sally and Bruce were lovely hosts who welcomed us into their home. The room was comfortable, clean, and the bed was wonderful! The location was very convenient for getting around town, and Sally was very knowledgeable of things to do in the area, giving us multiple suggestions for a rainy day. We are usually dog people, but Darwin rivaled the best of them (such an amazing cat!). We would definitely recommend Sally and Bruce's place to anyone, and we look forward to staying there again next time we are in Boston."
3012529,54918297,2015-11-25,47588624,Xia,Itis a great experience in Sally's home.
3012529,58605640,2016-01-03,49900203,Alecia,"Sally and Bruce were extremely welcoming, friendly, and accommodating. The room was clean, cozy, and well kept. They also had some great written instructions in the room that gave us wifi instructions as well as some other helpful tips. They also provided us with some very helpful tips about the Boston area, which was nice since we were there on vacation (and it was our first time in Boston). I would highly recommend staying with them!"
3012529,60309941,2016-01-21,55318007,Yosef,"The hosts made me feel welcome but did not provide the room that was promised.  They did not let me know this until I got there, which is fine, but the room provided was smaller and less furnished than the room that I paid for."
3012529,66936304,2016-03-25,62255406,Firoozeh,"We had a great time and enjoyed our stay over there. Sally and Bruce were very friendly, accommodating, flexible, warm hearted, and supportive. They provided all information we needed even public transit card. My son who is 10 y old would like to thank Sally and Bruce for making his first trip to Boston as a great experience. It was easy to communicate with them. I have to say it was like my home."
Their house is located in a very convenient area; close and well connected with public transportation,so easy to go everywhere you would like.,,,,
I strongly recommend this place.,,,,,

3012529,69156449,2016-04-09,65147372,Gisele,"Estive com minha mãe em Boston no início de abril e foi nossa primeira experiência com o Airbnb. A estadia na casa de Sally e Bruce foi perfeita! O local é acessível ao transporte público, também próximo a restaurantes e um supermercado. E o mais importante, o casal foi fantástico conosco, ajudando com dicas sobre passeios e sobre a locomoção na cidade. E contamos com a presença ilustre e fofa do gato Darwin, que é incrível!!! Recomendamos fortemente a casa de Sally e Bruce para aqueles que desejam ir para Boston e ficar em um lar muito especial e acolhedor."

3012529,70740041,2016-04-20,21746856,James,This was my second time staying with Sally & Bruce.
As before,"they were the perfect hosts. They give you the perfect balance of privacy when you want it and socialization when you want to do that. They are very helpful with points of interest in the Boston area.\"",,,,
3012529,71423558,2016-04-25,68468791,Silas,"I had a great stay with Sally and Bruce. They are friendly and make you feel at home. Sally goes the extra mile to make sure that you know how to get around to wherever you are going in Boston. You can sit and chat with her like you are staying with friends. Or she will leave you alone if you want. The room is clean, comfortable, and quiet. The T is a short walk and parking is available also."
3012529,71764963,2016-04-28,1229524,Ector,"Sally & Bruce made my short stay in Boston extremely comfortable.  I must say they are the most welcoming hosts I have yet encountered in the AIRBNB experience.  Very informative about local logistics, MTA, food and all.     Bruce's recommendation about Whole Food's (nearby) for reasonable and varied meals was especially helpful.  Darwin the cat also made me feel at home and help my transition to being a more cat-aware human.  Their flexibility has no bounds I think."
3012529,73767293,2016-05-10,65690396,Bhalchandra,The location was as described and accurate. The neighbourhood was good. Hosts were very friendly.

The room was great and I chatted with Sally for at least 30 minutes upon arriving. They provided a folder full of things to do in Boston and gave great advice on getting around town and good place to see and eat. Excellent location - about a 10 minute walk from the train that takes you straight into city. Also, the neighborhood is very nice and I felt safe walking all around it. I would stay with them again in a heartbeat."
3012529,75886388,2016-05-23,67480645,Junqi,Sally and Bruce were very friendly and helpful. We spent two nights and had a good rest in the house after the whole day trip. Great place. Darwin is very cute!
3012529,76178101,2016-05-25,67135422,Francis,"My wife and I stayed at Sally & Bruce’s house when we visited Boston. They gave us warm welcome, treated us nicely, and kindly offered us all kinds of helpful information when they learned that we are tourists. Bruce even accompanied my wife to CVS when she needed the help. I would recommend people to stay at Sally & Bruce’s house for their visit."

Great advice on the Quincy Market Mac and Cheese stand as well!"

We arrived early morning and Sally enabled us to come in and leave our backpacks. It was easy to get to from South Station – around 45 minutes -  and the B or C line will get you to within 7 minutes walk to theirs and there are some lovely houses around their tranquil neighbourhood.  Sally was very easy to communicate with and gave us a lot of tips when we were there and offered various maps. The room was kept neat with a little desk and more information on Boston with a shared bathroom as well as kitchen on either side. It was really nice chatting to Sally as well as Bruce and you have to simply love Darwin, the cat!"
It took us about 45min to the historic part of Boston and an easy half an hour to Harvard or MIT.  We were glad to have such hosts as Sally and Bruce and would be happy to visit again!,,,,,

The room was clean, in a fairly good location (a bit of a long walk to Allston, where I went a lot, but a $4 Uber ride will get you there), and generally lived up to my expectations."

3012529,83035935,2016-06-30,19334427,Ian,"Bruce kept sending texts to me during my way from airport to his house to ensure that we were on this right path. He stood on the sidewalk outside while we just arrived at. This made me felt we were so welcome. When I asked him about subway card and food questions, he kindly offered us a free ride to grocery store, resturant, and bus stop. We met Sally at night. She was also nice to discuss with me about my touring route plan. She gave me a local resident perspective and lots of travel documents for reference. They are really a nice couple and have no reservations to help people with hesitation. I strongly recommend."
3012529,83822989,2016-07-04,280310,Bill,Sally and Bruce were very kind and accommodating. The place was clean and comfortable and quite conveniently located. This is a splendid spot for the budget traveler.

3012529,91455251,2016-08-05,15280627,Sam,"Sally and Bruce were very helpful and very communicative. I gave this space a 3-star (avg) because I felt like the price tag was a bit high. If I'm paying $60+ to stay outside the city center, I want something just a bit tidier and a bit more private. All in all, a comfortable place to sleep though."

The inside is just like the pictures. We loved the complementary Keurig coffees which saved us a few dollars each day. The condo felt like our own home. We would recommend to anyone visiting Boston!!"
14713259,97746491,2016-08-28,91740728,Ron,This Airbnb was awesome. Anthony really makes sure you feel at home and that you have everything you need from clean towels to complementary coffee. He keeps the apartment clean and cozy. The location couldn't be better. I was in town for a conference at the Sheraton which was a 4 minute walk. There's also a 7-11 on the corner which was convenient. Highly recommend this airbnb!!

13007124,75805971,2016-05-23,70644414,Jean,"My eleven year old niece and I stayed here for three days. The apartment is located in a great neighborhood with a ton of local restaurants and shops. There's a fire station on the corner too, which helped me feel safer in an unfamiliar place. We were walking distance from all of the historical sites we went to see. We also visited Harvard, which was just a 20-30 minute trip with public transportation. The apartment was clean and well stocked with more than what we needed. There is no carpet, though, and voices carry in this space. We were never disturbed by any of the neighbors, but I worried about keeping our voices and the TV down.  I still prefer to stay at a hotel, but for the price and convenience, this place was absolutely worth it."
13007124,76368849,2016-05-26,61157549,Katie,My boyfriend and I were traveling to Boston and strictly just needed a place to keep our bags and a place to sleep. Nothing fancy. Jame's place was perfect and in a great spot in the North End. We walked everywhere while taking the T to Cambridge and Fenway Park. This is a perfect spot for a quick trip into the city. James was quick in response and made the process of getting keys easy and even gave us some recommendations on where to eat. I would choose this quaint spot if I were to visit Boston again!

13007124,80265514,2016-06-17,11965274,James,James was super responsive and helpful.  The check in process was simple and hassle free.  The place is small and pretty no thrills but in literally one of the best locations I could imagine being in during my stay in Boston.  If you need a place to sleep while you are in town and that is all you are looking for I couldn't recommend this place enough.
13007124,80865920,2016-06-20,15817256,Melanie,"James was incredibly responsive regarding any check in information. The apartment itself was a little trick to get to so fortunately it was easily explained by James a head of time. The apartment itself was really cute! Full kitchen was incredibly helpful as my fiancee and I had to work late in the city and it was nice to come back and be able to make some food. 7-11 is about two blocks away which was incredibly convenient for anything you may have forgotten. Everything in the apartment is brand new. Very centrally located in North End, very safe area. Walking distance to almost anything you want to get to. 10 mins to faneuil hall, 40 mins to Newberry, only a couple blocks to delicious Italian restaurants. No street parking so be sure to figure out which garage you are going to park in ahead of time. Would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Boston!"
13007124,81999675,2016-06-26,72138099,Mark,"This place was absolutely perfect! In a beautiful part of Boston where everything was very accessible from all the tourist attractions to the best neighborhood spots. This was my first Airbnb experience so I was very weary at first but James has such a perfect space and was very accommodating to my girlfriend and I and the rental itself was extremely clean with everything we could possibly need to enjoy our stay. Everyone seems to rave about location and this was definitely the spot to be in! So many of the best restaurants, must try bakeries (specifically Mike's Pastry!) and all of the historical must-sees but also a short trip to Fenway Park as well. Couldn't recommend it more. Awesome area, beautiful space, great host. And if I could rate it 6 stars I would!"
13007124,82644375,2016-06-28,36008331,Devin,"James, the apartment was great.  not a lot of feedback I can provide since you seem to have it taken care of. I would highlight the fact you provide cookware since a lot of restaurants in the North End are a bit pricey. I thought that was a nice touch that you could advertise more in your description of the apartment. other than that I had a great time."
13007124,83139740,2016-07-01,1886194,Dana,"Great little apartment in the heart of the North End. We stayed 3 nights in July and it was a cute spot, close to everything. Walking distance to Quincy Market/Long warf/T stations.  James was super easy contact and key pickup was a breeze!"

Vi informerte om dette umiddelbart, men det ble ikke ordnet. En morgen våknet vi av at det lakk vann inn i rommet. Vi måtte sette en bøtte under for å samle opp vann, det var mye som kom inn. Vi banket på i leiligheten over og kvinnen som åpnet kunne fortelle at dette ikke var uvanlig når hun dusjet, det hadde skjedd før. Dette burde verten informert om på forhånd! Å stå opp til klær våte av skittent vann er ikke hyggelig! Verten forsikret oss om at han skulle refundere deler av oppholdet og vi slo oss til ro med det. Etter vi sjekket ut har vi forsøkt å kontakte verten gjentatte ganger via text, telefon, mail og AirBnb meldinger, men verten har aldri svart oss. Vi ventet 14 dager med å skrive denne anmeldelsen i håp om at verten ordnet opp med refusjon som han lovet, men det har  ikke skjedd."

James was very responsive via AirBNB and text before and during our stay, and I never felt like my endless questions were a bother. He graciously agreed to extend our checkout time as well when I was worried we might not be back from our last outing in time. The washer and dryer in his apartment were a lifesaver, it's the only time I've ever come home from vacation with all clean clothes!"
The neighborhood,as I mentioned,is great and includes many great food options (less than a 5 minute walk away) like Giacomo's,Fiore,and the famous Mike's Pastry. Also if you are looking for breakfast we ate every day at an AMAZING shop at the corner of Charter and Hanover called My Cousin's Place,their prices were excellent and the proximity to the apartment can't be beat.

If you find yourself with a little bit of down time, talk to him, he's easy to chat with and has plenty of stories to share."

The location is perfect for is because we attended a trade show at Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. It only took us 10mins walk from the house to BCEC. There are good places to eat around the area. It only 15mins drive from his place to the North End area where Little Italy is located. And Michael's English bulldog, Fiona, is just adorable ❤️️"

He did not stay at the house for most of our stay because another guest was in the second bedroom, but he was staying close by and always responded to messages quickly. He has an adorable, fat english bulldog, Fiona, and she was very friendly."
The room was exactly as advertized and was very clean and neat. The bedroom we stayed in has a door that goes directly to the bathroom,which we had to share with the other guest but had no problems doing so. The only negative thing about the room was that it got a bit hot at night,and the bed was hot. (But the house does have A/C.) The kitchen and living room are on the second floor and they were clean and tidy like the rest of the house. The kitchen had a coffee maker,which was nice.,,
The place is a moderate walk to the convention center and probably a 20-25 minute walk to the edge of downtown. The bus is not far away. An uber from the house to downtown was usually around $6-7.,,,,,

It is a bit far away from the Metro - we walked at least 15 minutes.  We had 6 guests, and we got a mattress but no extra blankets, which was a bit cold at night.  the instructions for check in was easy, and host was responsive.  There were no extra things in the apartment though, such as sugar, map of the area and maybe some recommendations etc.  but there was Brita filter.  and there are not too many grocery stores close by, but there are a few cute restaurants.

Normal low level noise is to be expected in such a historic home & neighborhood (creaking floors above, light street noise), which didn't distract from our enjoyment of the space.  Kitchen is functional with the basics...everything was super clean (which isn't always the case with AirBnb rentals) and the location of the apartment was the best part of all...walkable to lots of restaurants/bars and convenient to the business district as well.

The place was clean and well organized, it suited our needs and exceeded our expectations. We greatly enjoyed the beautiful neighborhood, with narrow alleys and colonial style exteriors.

The neighborhood is super fun and we always felt very safe.  There are so many fun things to do in close walking distance, and the rest is about a 15 min uber or bus ride away. Highly recommend!"

They were very helpful and gave us many tips about Boston! The room has enough space and everything you need including an AC.

We shared time and space at Mike-and-Rachael's at a very friendly way. They are professional hosts which help you with everything needed, and provides you not only with advices but also with useful things like metro cards, brochures, etc. We were lucky to be presented even a pair of free cards to the Museum of Fine Arts where we definitely went with a great delight."

It was in a very nice neighborhood where three-storey buildings neatly line up along the street. The listings are accurate, in fact the room is nicer than we imagined. The futon is very comfortable, the room is clean with desk and closet as well as air conditioning. The bathroom and kitchen are clean and convenient too."

We arrived via New York and the weather was unseasonably hot so we were grateful for the cool and calm stay in Boston.  As other guests have mentioned, the air con is a little noisy but that's better than not being able to sleep for the heat."
The whole place was very clean.  The bed was very comfortable,and the room is spacious and well-equipped. Hot coffee every morning was a definite bonus!  We were also able to leave a few things in Mike & Rachel's care while we headed out of town for the weekend. They went the extra mile for us.,,,,

6523777,49383598,2015-10-03,31660607,Joseph,"Another good Airbnb experience. Michael was at the door to greet me, though late at night, a time that worked best for me. The room was exactly as described; warm, comfortable and convenient. The attention to a good experience continued with offers for refreshments,   and anything else I may need. A comfy chair, desk and WiFi with privacy and I was in heaven. The futon was comfortable and I cannot tell you how excellent the coffee was in the morning. I would not hesitate to stay here again.

I could enjoy fresh coffee every morning, and was also able to do my laundry there.  About 10 mins walk to JFK station - red line, although I mostly used Uber to move around. In all, decent place with reasonable price."
6523777,51253063,2015-10-18,2280297,Daniel,"I had a two day conference to attend at Massachusetts General Hospital and I stayed at Mike and Rachael's place since it was near the redline of the Boston subway train (Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority -MBTA). Other than me arriving really late the first night, which Mike graciously dealt with in the nicest way possible, the trip went perfectly and staying at Mike and Rachael's place was very convenient since I had a comfy room to stay at, yet could get to the conference in 20 mins as his place is 3 blocks from the Savin Hill Red Line MBTA station and only 6 stops from the Charles River/Mass General stop. I really recommend those wanting to visit the Charles River or Mass General to stay with Mike and Rachael as it was good option for a fair price."
6523777,51747595,2015-10-24,43958181,Ben,"Great room, and the location was ideal - quiet, residential part of Boston but right next to the red line T station, so very easy to get into the centre."

But they definitely are very hospitablw, nice people and easy going. Mike is very willing to give you tips for your stay.

The metro-station is not far (5 min Walk), and the Center of Boston is easily reached within a few stops."
6523777,52278977,2015-10-27,45486635,Alex,"I stayed here for 2 nights for a conference at the Massachusetts' Convention Center. Mike and Rachael's place is located conveniently close to the Savin Hill Station on the Red Line, which is only a 5 minute walk away. The hosts were very relaxed and the room was clean with a comfortable bed. A nice touch is they always have coffee prepared in the coffee maker, just press the on button and you have a cup. All in all, a very comfortable and affordable place to stay near the Red Line."
6523777,53220354,2015-11-06,47804105,Chris,Mike and Rachael provided an excellent place to stay during my three days in Boston. I was researching at the JFK Archives and this place was perfect for my needs.

We made a last minute reservation and they accepted our reservation quickly and immediately informed us the check in details. Mike wrote us a very detail instruction on how to get there from the train station. Second, their place is strategically located near the red T line station and goes directly to  the South bus and train station. So that was so convenient. Third, the neighborhood has  amazing restaurants. We tried some based on their recommendations and we were not disappointed. Fyi, Rachel is a chef and I was told that Mike is also a good cook, so trust their taste in food! Last but not least, they make the most amazing coffee. They even made coffee by request :) Oh, and Rachel baked us TONS of cakes/baked goods. So grateful to have them as our host. Would recommend them to anyone without any hesitation."

In case you arrive by car you will find some place for parking on the street close to their house, we caught a place almost in front of the house. Mike and Rachel invited us in very nice and warm way and they have plenty of advises what to do in Boston. House is really a few steps from Savin Hill (red line subway) which is direct connection to the downtown and to Cambridge. We also enjoyed the late summer evenings on their balcony and we appreciated the possibility to use the washing machine after one week stay in NYC."

The guest room is clean, comfortable, and well-equipped with lots of outlets, toiletries, etc. They are excited about sharing information about their neighborhood and Boston.

The suite is perfect for any visitor: spacious and clean, with plenty of closet space if you want to hang anything. Brad is also a great host. He gave me a tour of the neighborhood, told me a lot of fun facts about the area (that only someone who lives in Boston would know), and helped me learn my way around. He also had a lot of great suggestions for things to check out while I was in town."

He is open to being as interactive with your stay as you would like. He has some great advice for things to do/see in Boston and is also knowledgeable about a lot of the history and area."
The building and location itself was FANTASTIC! It really made me fall in love with Boston once again after stepping onto the rooftop terrace. It has this amazing view of the 'new' Boston all the way to the 'original' Boston from the 1600's. The rooftop is open to the whole building,but I never saw anyone up there. North End is an area I haven't explored much,but will definitely be back to see more of it. There is some fantastic little 'mom and pop' type cafes,restaurants,and shops. It is a fantastic old world feel.,
The space itself was warm and inviting. Very open and had a good flow and lots of natural light. The apartment is also spotted with Brad's wonderful wood art--natural yet somehow modern earth tones. The place was recently renovated and really well done if I say so myself. The room available for rent had its own bathroom,tv,desk,and plenty of storage and closet space. It was very comfortable.,,

4034018,38522419,2015-07-16,36227076,Rachel,Great place to stay in the North End! Everything was as described. We loved the rooftop deck at sunset-gorgeous views of the city. Brad was easy to work with-we appreciated being able to check-in early. The location was perfect-super close to the Freedom Trail and many great restaurants. I even enjoyed the walk up the 5 flights of stairs at the end of the day-made me feel less guilty about all the amazing food we enjoyed while in Boston!
4034018,39235729,2015-07-21,38350971,Kaley,"Brad's penthouse was an absolute delight! The location could not have been better for our first trip to Boston. Walking distance to Freedom Trail, harbor, feneuil hall (shopping) and many ,many restaurants and bars! A note left on the counter gave us pointers as to which restaurants were most enjoyable and sites to see with some directions. Getting the key and gaining access was very simple ,and paid parking for our car was steps away.. Apt was very clean, had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable.Lastly, the rooftop patio was maybe the best part!! Thanks so much Brad for a wonderful stay at your gorgeous penthouse!!"
4034018,39973697,2015-07-27,36991581,Amanda,"Beautiful apartment in a great location! We really enjoyed our stay, and Brad was a wonderful host!"

4034018,42194588,2015-08-11,27098755,N.J.,"A delightful stay in North End!  The 5th floor is not for the feint-of-heart, but being steps from Neptune, Polcari's, Maria's, Mike's, Peace Garden, and all that the North End has to offer makes every step worth it!  We didn't use any of the amenities in the apartment because there was so much to do all around us!  We would definitely enjoy staying again!"
4034018,44476704,2015-08-26,4352245,Anne & Jos,"Brad was wonderful - easy to communicate with, he had great food suggestions for the area. His place is beautiful - quiet, artsy, right in the middle of everything. Awesome AirBnB experience that we can only recommend."
4034018,71119979,2016-04-23,48268935,Jim,"Brad was great and met me at the apartment to welcome me and show me around.  Apartment is awesome and has terrific views, very comfortable.  Fantastic light, great air circulation -- not always the case in the North End!  Was there for a week and so both cooked in (wonderful local markets and Italian delicacies!) and ate out in some of the great North End Italian restaurants.  Kitchen is very well equipped.  Good entertainment system, nice and easy access to roof deck.   Yeah, it's a fifth floor walk-up but it's really not bad at all.  One of the best Airbnb experiences I've had."
4034018,87546678,2016-07-20,70565228,Kelly,"Great location on the north end. Cooper Street is a skinny one way street that definitely has a European feel. Apartment is very nice...exactly how it looks in Brad's pictures...clean, well kept and comfortable. It is up 4 flights of stairs which guests should be aware of...And I will say that a coffee pot would be (URL HIDDEN) would have let us enjoy the apartment more in the mornings. I would definitely stay here again."
4034018,89306729,2016-07-27,72123296,Garfield,"Brad was a fantastic host.  His place was exactly as described, clean, bright and open.   He is extremely knowledgeable about the town, places to go and what to do.   The rooftop deck was a pleasure and I only wished I used it sooner than the last night.   It was a great experience."
The North End is a wonderful place with lots of great places to eat,drink and shop all the while being a 7 minute walk from downtown Boston.   Everyone was friendly and willing to give their opinion even down to which pastry whop was better.  Mike's or Modern.... we voted for Modern,hands down.,,,
Would definitely stay at Brad's place again,would just spend more time on the rooftop deck with a couple bottles of wine and pastries from Modern.,,,,

12825412,81780702,2016-06-25,65830330,Jason,What a beautiful home just a short walk from Bunker Hill monument and the USS Constitution. Laurie provided all the information for a smooth arrival and great recommendations for food and things to do in the Charlestown neighborhood. Our stay in Boston was made all the more memorable by our stay at Laurie's. The hospitality was top notch and we wouldn't have known we were the first AirBnBers that Laurie hosted unless she let us know. We know where we'll be staying our next time in Boston. Do yourself a favor and book Laurie's place today!
12825412,84246386,2016-07-06,68232412,Howard,We stayed over the fourth of July weekend and really enjoyed. The place is much nicer than you would think from the pictures. It's a charming place I'm a quiet neighborhood that isn't far from the sights. Laurie was a friendly host. Highly recommend

Where to eat, where to shop, what to do, maps, interest book and detailed information about the city of charlestown and boston.  The home was awesome, bigger than expected.  Plenty of room nice kitchen nice bathrooms very spacious and she was very quick with response messages if i needed her.  I would love to stay again."
12825412,92717343,2016-08-09,36423862,Kevin,"Laurie's place was perfect for our 4 day trip to Boston! It was so easy to work with her, and we received immediate communication after instant booking, which was reassuring. When I asked to add another night to our stay, Laurie was extremely helpful and accommodating. Communication and updates were excellent every step of the way."
As far as the place goes,it was perfect! Parking was so easy,and the street was so picturesque and quaint,just steps from Th Freedom Trail. We were able to walk to our Super Duck tour that left from Navy Yard,and the North End,Faneuil Hall
The best part was the place itself. Laurie left us very thoughtful snacks like delicious Greek yogurt,granola and K-cups of every stripe. There were great instructions on the modern home,and a wonderful visitors' guide. The home was super comfortable and clean,with fabulous,well-lit reading nooks placed throughout. The artwork was gorgeous,adding to the overall great energy of this place!
What a great Airbnb find,"and I highly recommend Laurie's place when you're visiting Biston!\"",,,,

I was there to visit BU and I could probably easily have walked there from this place.  The room was as exactly shown in the pictures.  Clean, wifi works, roomy space.  You'll have your own private space as I haven't really ran into Issac or Claudia during my stay.  They were very accommodating in every way, perfect hosts. I was easy to get hold of them via texts/call whenever needed. I highly recommend this place and would love to stay again!"

Great accomodations when visiting Boston.
2114274,13314869,2014-05-25,13700803,Sander,Isaac and Claudia are extraordinary friendly hosts. They treat their guests very respectful and are always willing to provide the traveler with information about Boston and things to do including a Lonely Planet about Boston. Their apartment is close to the hippest area in Boston. All rooms were tidy and functional and they even left a whole rack of space in the fridge for me :)

- This was my first time using Airbnb and Isaac is a real nice host and interesting guy and made me feel welcome and at home.  He offered to carry my bag up the flight of steps to the apartment and provided slippers for me to use in the apartment.  We also chatted some a couple times.  I did not get to meet Claudia.,,,,,
- Host very unobtrusive,,,,,

Their house is located in Packards Corner, within walking distance from Boston University Campus, only 2 minutes away from T green line and several bus lines, and a big supermarket. Their place is large, so we had plenty of space even though we had all our moving stuff with us. Plus, they were very feiendly and helpful with all the questions and doubts we had about moving to Boston and living there. Do not hesitate to go there!"

2114274,66585774,2016-03-23,9231868,Diane,"Isaac & Claudia were nice and helpful hosts! We didn't get to talk much (the only common space was the small kitchen), but I enjoyed the few short chats we had.  The room looks better in person.  There is an inviting table by the bay window, which has an expansive view--I loved to do work and reading there.  The sofa bed was just as comfortable and sturdy as a real bed.  Plenty of space to spread out my things on the coffee table as well.  I almost think they didn't need to advertise the room as a living room, as it has its own door and functions perfectly as a bedroom.  Isaac & Claudia were apologetic about the electrical work being done in the building, but it really didn't bother me, as the room was on the far end of the apartment, away from the workers in the hallways.  They also provided a heavier winter comforter when the weather got colder and helped me with my bags on arrival and departure.  Thank you for a great stay, Isaac & Claudia!  (Guest tip:  One of the best bakeries in town is around the corner.)"

The apartment was clean and comfortable with a lot of character with the exposed brick and beamed ceilings. The location was perfect, steps from a multitude of bars, restaurants and shops and near transit and the waterfront.

The apt was as described. Ample space, well equipped kitchen (I think Jay may soon add a coffee maker), comfortable beds, working internet and TV, good shower, quiet location -- yet it's in the bustling wonderful North End (Italian) neighborhood of Boston, which is very near to historic sites, great food (including an outdoor fish & produce market on Fri & Sat), and easy transportation (on foot, by bike, by subway & ferry).

Jay was very kind and even helped us carrying the luggage upstairs.,,,,,
If we ever go back to Boston we know where to stay: at Jay's!;-),,,,,
Thanks,"Jay!\"",,,,
3664031,28101310,2015-03-17,121479,Jennifer,Jay was great! He met me when I arrived and gave me a tour of his place making me feel right at home!
It was clean and tidy and had all the amenities you would find in a hotel.,,,,,
Location is great - right in the middle of Little Italy.,,,,,
"Thanks Jay! \"",,,,,
3664031,28252628,2015-03-21,25933249,Roger,Jay is a great host who warmly welcomed us on the cold Boston afternoon of March 17th (he even picked us up with his car). Check-in / check-out was totally hassle-free. The apartment itself is perfectly located in Boston's Little Italy (so lots of great Italian restaurants only a few steps away). The apt is quite big (with a big kitchen) and very comfy due to the open brick wall and the wood ceiling. All was clean and tidy. The house is badly soundproofed so you have to keep the noise down in order to not spoil things with the neighbors (so definitely not a location for party folks). But I can absolutely recommend the place to anyone who visits Boston!
3664031,28645666,2015-03-28,206149,Patricia,Jays place was perfect for us and in a great location. Everything was as advertised with easy in and out. Jay was easy to work with.
3664031,29719128,2015-04-12,10172315,Pat,"Jay was great. The location was wonderful, and the pictures were representative of the apartment. I would stay there again if I was going to be in Boston for a few days."
3664031,30092276,2015-04-17,338567,Ben,"Jay welcomed us personally in his apartment and was very flexible regarding check in time. His place suited our needs perfectly. IT´s clean and has absolutely everything you need. The location is more than awesome, just two blocks away from the harbour and from bustling streets with lots of shops and restaurants.Thanks so much Jay!"
3664031,30373641,2015-04-21,839744,Melissa,"Jay did an excellent job communicating with us regarding our stay.  The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for preparing small meals. It was very comfortable for 4 adults and 1 child(10).  The location was great for walking to Faneuil Hall, the Commons and the North End."
3664031,30611514,2015-04-25,27199733,Brian,"Jay's place is exactly as listed. It is a nice, clean 2 bed (2 doubles). Jay is quite easy going so that made a big difference with altering arrival and departure times. The location is perfect, in the middle of the Italian district. There are lots of excellent restaurants and bars on the door step. The T is only 7-8 min walk away. Very satisfied with my experience, I will both recommend Jay's place to friends travelling to Boston and stay again on my return."
3664031,30971182,2015-04-30,23368611,Diane,"We would recommend Jay's apartment if you're looking for a cosy place to stay, within easy walking distance to many of the attractions. Jay was a great communicator from the initial contact through to the completion of the stay. He responded quickly by email every time. He was unable to meet us but left clear instructions where to pick up and drop off the key. Not knowing anything about Boston (coming from Australia), we discovered we had chosen a great location & neighbourhood. The place is smallish for 4 people but we knew this & it didn't matter as we were out and about a lot & used it as a base. Be prepared to walk up 3 small flights of stairs & not make too much noise. Again, no problem."
3664031,35445688,2015-06-19,24400768,Amy,"The listing description was accurate, the place was clean and neat, and the host met us on time and gave us information to take public transportation there.  THe host was very easy to get ahold of and was very cordial.  He also was so kind to let us leave luggage past the  check out time so we could continue to tour the area while waiting for our rental car pickup time.  Great place and loved the area , so much to see and do and it was so central to where we wanted to be!!!"
3664031,68391838,2016-04-04,7135769,Cristina,Jay was very kind and helpfull and the flat is exactly as it looks on the website. Wonderful location in Boston!

6544642,38557290,2015-07-16,3584337,Mike,"It was a very nice place, not far from downtown and easy to navigate to. A perfect stop for a business traveler like myself and very fairly priced. Michael was very responsive and the place was clean. I am thankful that Michael is willing to share this apartment with others and hope to stay there again on my next trip."
6544642,41669145,2015-08-08,38620558,Tyrees,"I had a great time in Boston, mostly because Michael provided us such a great place to come back to to recharge out batteries. The place was clean and welcoming and located a short bus ride to the T or uber ride into the south end. I'd love to stay at michael's place the next time I'm in Boston."
6544642,42581926,2015-08-14,16970144,Jose,This is a great place! Enough space for two people. Great location and had everything that is needed for a stay in Boston.
6544642,43185174,2015-08-17,41280852,Sally,"The studio is very nice and more than adequate. Great neighborhood. Michael responded to all of our communications and was a great resource. Parking is a challenge but doable, especially on the weekends where visitors are given a chance to park on resident streets. One street is Avenue K. Read the signs. Learn how to navigate the T (transportation system of buses and trains, which is right on the corner. Color coded and easy and inexpensive. FYI get a street map, Carson beach is only six blocks away! I would definitely stay here again."
6544642,51330882,2015-10-19,3435382,John,"Michael's studio was GREAT! It was comfortable, clean and within walking distance to coffee, groceries, restaurants and bars. Next time I'm in Boston, I wouldn't stay anywhere else."

6544642,81736976,2016-06-24,3479408,Diane,I had a great stay at Michael's Southie apartment. It was perfectly located for me to walk to work and had everything I needed. I would definitely consider staying there again next time I'm in Boston.

6544642,88660692,2016-07-25,78500170,Lana,"Very cute and clean place! Spot on location: minutes walk to the beach and many local restaurants and bars, 5 minute car ride to South Station and Blue Hills Bank Pavillion. Super recommend!!"
6544642,92092413,2016-08-07,20233871,Micah,Michael was very responsive and his place was in a great location. South Boston has lots of great places to eat and good nightlife around the studio apartment. Great for a quick business trip. I would definitely stay there again.
6544642,92660808,2016-08-09,50387642,Troy,"This studio was very nice looking, but the location was further from Downtown Boston (shops bars and restaurants) than we realized.  It was on a busy street, so there was some street noise at night.  The host did provide a white noise machine which helped."
6544642,93122024,2016-08-11,43071513,Matt,Great place to stay! Didn't realise how far out of downtown it was. But there was a lot in the area to keep us occupied. Thanks
6544642,95978501,2016-08-21,32160140,Paul,"Great location, clean nice little apartment. Full size bed. Parking is hard sometime, so, park your car early, and take bus or Marta at night."
6544642,98021320,2016-08-29,34535557,Araina,Very cute and friendly neighborhood. Michael was very helpful setting up the lockbox since we were going to be arriving late as we had a long drive fromNYC after work. Also was always a text away and helped with any questions I had. Overall a great stay!
31796,52666,2010-06-13,127914,Sebastien,Nice host!
Pace convenient to visit the city: metro (red line) near the house,parking on the road (free)without any difficulty.,,,,
She offered us coffee and something for breakfast (even if it isn't included in her price!).,,,,,
We can recommend it!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
31796,61198,2010-07-05,87281,Vishal,"We stayed at Hermina's for the July 4th weekend. Her place is bright, airy and clean. It's also really convenient for the Metro."
The only downside to her place was that it's right next to a police precinct and it was really noisy all night with all the emergency vehicles. However,it seems that was an aberration due to the 4th.,,,,
"We'd totally recommend staying there on a regular weekend or if you visit at a time of the year when you can sleep with the windows closed. \"",,,,,
31796,66942,2010-07-20,157262,Visala,"Namaste,"
Staying at Hermina's is like being on a meditation retreat.  Her home is peace filed.  Hermina is a friendly and kind woman.  She cares about her guests and helps them feel comfortable.  She is precise and helpful with directions and has excellent suggestions for travel and eating out. My daughter and I both really enjoyed staying with her.  If you travel to Boston,Hermina's home is a superb choice!  An added bonus is the 40 foot marble Quan Yin  just directly across the street from her home.  The neighborhood vibrates with good energy.,,,,
"Emjoy!\"",,,,,

31796,85236,2010-08-26,102688,Pat,"What a joy! The room was delightful and comfortable; the kitchen warm and friendly, and the hostess was delightful."
Before booking,I had read the review about the police station being nearby.  That didn't bother me one bit.,,,,
Thanks so much,"Hermina!\"",,,,
31796,86301,2010-08-28,131306,Juanita,Convenient to the subway I would highly recommend this host. I stayed in her basement apt on a comfy bed with a beautiful quilt and a private revovated and clean bath. Hermina is so nice and gracious

31796,102281,2010-09-21,223197,Maria,"Well how should I start...  I never met Hermina, because she had a sudden family emergency to attend in Armenia. Hope all is well! Her home is cozy and cute. We met one of the housemate left in charge. We didn't hang out much at the house, but when we were there it was quite and peace as the mornings were. The location to the T lines worked out great. Hop on and go anywhere. The neighborhood may seem a bit sketchy for non-city folks, but harmless. The people were limited of their English, but nice and helpful. We stay two nights. All and all after some mix up due to Hermina's sudden departure, worked out. We didn't need catering to, but if your in to that, then hope for her to be around. I've heard she's a charm. If you go, always remember to leave the key where you found it. That we learned the hard way. Thanks Hermina for offering your home to us. Best wishes."
31796,104705,2010-09-25,189435,Elsie,It was  a gret experience staying at Hermina's house.

31796,108905,2010-09-30,242335,Karen,"Hermina is a great hostess! It is more like staying with a a friend than staying in a hotel. If I come to Boston again, I will stay here! My son and I stayed in the basement, complete with a refrigerator and microwave and laundry facilities for longer stays. It was very quiet and comfortable. You can also use the main kitchen if you need to. The bathroom is shared with one other basement unit so plan your showers if it is occupied. Hermina is very accomodating and helpful with directions, etc., and is a person of generous spirit and refined intelligence. Thank you Hermina!"
31796,111693,2010-10-04,237719,Roberto,I spent almost a week in Boston at Hermina's house. She is a very nice person and a generous guide concerning what is going on in Boston and where to go.
I was glad to have had the opportunity to share my cooking skills with her. When I was at home I felt completely confortable.,,,,,
The house is nice and the position is good: 5 min from the T-red subway station and 20 min from Boston Downtown.,,,,,
If I go to boston in the future,I will be there again.,,,,

31796,113691,2010-10-07,241952,Sahar,"our FIRST use of Airbnb. When we arrived Hermina wasn't there and another guest opened the door for us. when I called her she told me that our room is in the basement and told me where I can find the key. But I couldn't find it because previous guests hadn't leaved yet!! After they left we went to the room, it was messy and DIRTY. WE had to changed the bed sheets ourselves! We didn't expect it at all! The bathroom was so DIRTY, the trashcan was full and the carpet was wet and gross  and smelled awful!"
the advantages of this house was that it is so near to the RED line subway station.,,,,,

I attended a conference at the Boston Convention and Exposition Center, and there was never any problem getting to and from the center.  Not a single taxi ride!"
The home's accommodations were simple,but I had the added advantage of a room with separate rear access and a sink in my room (part of a partial kitchenette).  There was a shared refrigerator and coin-operated washer/dryer.  The separate access kept it very private for me although the bathroom was shared.  I only saw one other person for one short moment,and I was in Boston for ten days.  This worked out very well and saved me a ton of money!  Thanks,Hermina!,,
There is,of course,"a full kitchen which I saw other tenants using as I arrived and departed.  I just never had time or need for this.\"",,,

If you drive like we did, parking is easy and available. The house itself was an older duplex--not luxurious, but well kept, welcoming, and clean.  Hermina was away but her friend welcomed us and we enjoyed our conversations with him.  We were on our own for breakfast, but were invited to use whatever food we found in the house which was plentiful.  Instead, we opted to take the 15 minute walk recommended by others and walk down to the excellent Dot2Dot Cafe at 1739 Dorchester Ave.  I'd say the only negative is that there is not much foot traffic at night in the general area, so I might have felt a little uncomfortable walking around at night if returning late via the T."
31796,511448,2011-09-07,984767,Bernardo,We were four and stayed in the basement. The room was clean as well as the bathroom. Linen and towels were provided.
Street parking is free,safe and easy. Free wi-fi is a major plus for people who are in town working.,,,,
Unfortunately I didn't meet Hermina who I heard is a wonderful person,but her friend Tigran who was taking care of the house was very helpful.,,,,
If you're hungry,"head to the Vietnamese place just around the corner.\"",,,,
31796,516305,2011-09-09,1011807,Ted,We had a lovely experience as guests at Hermina's home.

31796,560149,2011-09-23,1117297,Calista,"Perfect!  My boyfriend and I stayed here for a few days while roadtripping through the region, and it was lovely.  The house is gorgeous, and Hermina is an excellent and helpful hostess.  We were able to park right across the street with no issues, the T station is just a few blocks away, and there's a decent grocery store nearby for essentials.  I would definitely recommend this place!"
31796,587414,2011-10-01,710928,Jane,Hermina's house if a wonderful example of the architecture of early 19th century Dorchester and Boston.  It is very well located for full access to all of Boston via public transportation.  She is a warm and welcoming host.  I appreciated my stay.
31796,591192,2011-10-02,937976,Andrew,"Nice house and good deal. Being close to the T was the best feature. My room was small, but that was neither a problem nor unexpected for $60."
31796,601968,2011-10-05,1171850,Steve,Hermina seems like a very nice person who communicates will with prospective renters. Unfortunately I simply was not comfortable staying there because my tastes require a cleaner environment.
31796,604950,2011-10-06,1227236,James,"Great house, great people, great location"
31796,617911,2011-10-11,172867,Mareike,Hermina is very lovely and helpul. We had so many funny and great conversations that she made me feel like home! She even invited me to make a day trip with her north from Boston which was an unforgetable and funny time!
Her house is really nice and cozy! The cta is just around the corner and you can find many restaurants and a supermarket as well.,,,,,
I really enjoyed staying in her house and sharing time with her. I hope to come back soon.,,,,,
"Thanks for everything and big hug\"",,,,,
31796,643825,2011-10-18,1272773,Nayeon,"The location is very good, near the subway station. (red line)"

31796,747877,2011-11-27,1426799,Isabelle,We loved to stay at Hermina's! We will definitely stay there again during our next get away week end in Boston.
31796,1107676,2012-04-11,1430866,Yen,Hermina was a great host :) We were here for the PAX East convention and the ride to and from was only about 20-30minutes...which was perfect.
She fixed breakfast but we liked to sleep in a bit.  The house was in a very safe place next to a police station.  There are many different restaurants(Vietnamese,diners,Chinese,pizza,fast food) nearby,10min walk to the tram/bus stations and the house is easy to locate.
The house was very well kept and Hermina makes you feel very welcome and comfortable.  Beds were a on the hard side but I slept like a baby.  Other people were in the house as well so every once in a while you hear footsteps and floor boards creaking at night.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
31796,1308047,2012-05-20,1806724,Marianne,"We really enjoyed our stay at Hermina's! Hermina was really nice to us, always happy to chat for a while. I enjoyed chatting with her about her life in Boston. Her house is conviniently located, close to a metro station which takes you to Boston city center in 10 min. It is really quiet at night as well, you won't be disturbed during your sleep!"
The house is really pretty,and very large. I particularly appreciated the decoration in our room,Hermina put a lot of details in it,that makes it even more enjoyable,as if we were at home,"and not in a hotel. I highly recommend this accommodation!\""
31796,1408144,2012-06-03,2297617,Sean,"Hermina provided us a place to stay on very short notice. I e-mailed her the day prior, and she opened up the process for me to book a room at her home for two nights. When we arrived, she provided a way to get into the house, a clean room and bed, and bathroom. She even allowed us to steal some of the fridge for holding some food and let us eat some of her breakfast fixings. It was a pleasure to stay there for 2 nights. If we ever return to Boston, we'll definitely be contacting her! Also worth noting - we had a car and parking was not an issue at all. Lastly, the T Station is VERY close - a 5 minute walk if you take your time. All in all - a great accommodation!"
31796,1417175,2012-06-04,815927,Ana Cecilia,"Hermina was very nice and responsive. I was assigned to a very big, and comfortable room. Linens and towel were provided (also a big plus for me, since I wasn't carrying any). She nicely offered coffee, toast, fruit, and yogurt for breakfast - which is always very appreciated :)."
The house is also conveniently located - it's a 5min walk from the T-stop (red line),albeit somehow far away from Cambridge,"if that is where you are hanging out (about 40min).\"",,,
31796,1444252,2012-06-09,1215201,Liss & David,"Great place, lots of fun people.  Hermina was really very nice. She was available for everything. We have 2 graduations 3 dinners, 4 receoptions , 9 cocktails, but we came home and crashed and slelpt like babies.................then left for NYC which was great."
31796,1773986,2012-07-22,2972045,Steven,"Hermina was out of town when we stayed the night at her place. She gave me contact information for someone else. When I called to find out what room I was in, the guy who answered was polite, and quickly answered all my questions."
It was easy to get into the house,because of clear instructions. The room was very big and clean.,,,,
Pros:,,,,,
- location was very close to the T,,,,,
- big room clean room and kitchen to use,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
- the location was kind of sketchy. I was very worried about my car being out front. (being next to a police station was the only thing stopping me from paying for parking somewhere else),,,,,
- the house was shared with several other people. No problems,but leaving all my stuff was a little worrisome,without locking everything up.,,,
All in all,this place was more of a hostel feel,than hotel. But for being so close to down town Boston,"the price was right and we had a good experience.\"",,
31796,1801567,2012-07-25,2537827,Nicholas,"Hermina was easy to communicate with and very professional. The pros: The house itself is comfortable and only a ~15-20min train ride to down town Boston. Good price, spacious rooms and fully equipped kitchen. The basement room which we stayed in was nice and cool throughout the night even on a hot summers day. The cons: the house has a few levels with wooden floors, staircases and thin doors which means sound travels easily. It can be hard to sleep, if you are a light sleeper, especially when there are people on the floor above yours. The shower which we used was horribly dirty and had not been cleaned in a long time, rest of the bathroom was clean. Kitchen was clean but the fridge was overflowing with old food which needed to be tossed out. In short, for the price, I would still recommend staying with Hermina."
31796,1838836,2012-07-30,2779566,James,"great place to stay, very friendly"
31796,1928146,2012-08-08,2397558,Claudia,"Hermina is nice, friendly and generous  but she didn't tell us that the room was  in the basement. The room is big but  is humid and smells humid. It is dark because there is only a small window. When we arrived we could not understand if the bed sheets were used or not. In the room there isn't any wardrobe where put or  hung clothes. The room , and the house in general is not clean. We had bugs in the room. Bathroom in the basement is small and not clean. Dorchester is not a nice suburb, but the house is very close to subway. We would NOT come back."
31796,1968691,2012-08-13,1668548,Sophie,"Même si le quartier ne paraît pas super sûr de prime abord, nous n'avons eu aucun problème, et la maison jouxte une station de police (et un temple bouddhiste!). Pas de problème pour se garer non plus, et la station de métro est à 5 min à peine à pied pour rejoindre le centre-ville de Boston en moins de 20 min! Il y a un centre commercial, delis et restaurants juste au coin pour les ravitaillements."
La maison d'Hermina est très spacieuse,notre chambre (A) en sous-sol l'était aussi avec un immense lit et un canapé-lit,et accès à une salle de douche au sous-sol aussi partagée avec une seule chambre.,,,
Hermina nous a donné toutes les informations nécessaires pour nous installer avant qu'on la voit le soir même. Hermina nous a offert de super petits déjeuners,fruits frais,café Bodum,et on peut se servir dans le frigo à volonté! Et Hermina est toujours prête à discuter avec ses hôtes,à nous filer des tuyaux de visite,et en plus a été très patiente avec les enfants!
"Un super séjour chez Hermina et une très bonne base pour visiter Boston!\"",,,,,

She was also gracious enough to give us a 7 day pass for the T for free. All in all, our experience staying with Hermina and dealing with her was near perfect.  I would highly recommend her to prospies .."
"\"",,,,,
31796,2198650,2012-09-04,3323075,Joshua,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Hermina's over Labor Day weekend. I had a nice, large room with two beds, a couch, and a sink. The bathroom on my floor was shared with one other room, but if there was someone staying in that room, I never saw them, so it felt very much like I had the whole basement to myself. It was very private. Hermina literally told me I could eat anything in the kitchen, and she kept it very well-stocked. She was really friendly and sweet without being intrusive and gave me good tips for what to do in the neighborhood and how to get around. The French press coffee was delicious, the Wi-Fi worked great, and everything was kept very clean and tidy. Absolutely no complaints!"
31796,2258072,2012-09-10,3451174,Michelle,"We stayed with Hermina for a night before driving down to Rhode Island for a wedding. We had a great time! The room was fantastic, and Hermina was very helpful. The house is a very short walk to the metro, so it was very easy to get to the center of Boston. We would come back here!"
31796,2385106,2012-09-23,3529093,Bastian,"This is a big room in the basement of Hermina's house. She lives upstairs and is very friendly, helpful and easy going. We've been welcomed to use anything in the kitchen and fridge, which was packed! Coming home late night is no problem and Boston is a great place to go. Washing and drying is possible in the basement. Thank you, Hermina!"

31796,2433178,2012-09-27,3358605,Nick,"Hermina was very accommodating and welcoming. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and made delicious cups of tea. Her fridge and pantry was well stocked so if you had forgotten something, she was more than happy to share. Her home is well situated being close to some local shops (shoe stores, Radio Shack, McDonalds, Grocery stores etc), but also not too far away (~2mins walk) is the train and bus station. You can be in Downtown Boston on the train in about 15 minutes. The house also has several other guest rooms so there lenity of opportunities to meet other people from all over the world; this added to the Airbnb experience."
31796,2532263,2012-10-07,782476,Trevor,"Hermina provided a lovely room with lots of space, only a few blocks from a Red Line T stop. She was both hospitable and helpful. I definitely would recommend staying here."

We loved that we had a safe place to park our car and we were just a block or two away from the T station. So, we dropped our bags and hit the town- we caught a 10pm show, so we came in late and slept in late (sorry, Hermina!). We didn't meet our host until we were packed and ready to leave, but we were so appreciative of her flexibility and willingness to answer questions. My boyfriend said \"\"it's like we were staying in a hotel!\"\" \""
31796,3046043,2012-12-08,4276707,Derrick,Hermina was a kind hostess and very responsive.  The house is lovely and the location is very convenient to public transportation.  And if you like pho (I know I love it) do try the Vietnamese place around the corner.
31796,3328406,2013-01-11,4517108,Joe,Hermina welcomed me into her lovely home. Our schedules were different but I got to speak with her briefly in the mornings and evenings. She is very kind and I felt more at home than I have ever been during a business trip.
My room was upstairs and I shared the hallway bathroom with one other guest. The rooms were very large compared to what I am used to and the bed was quite comfortable.,,,,,
The location is great - there are quite a few restaurants and a park just around the corner and the area is pedestrian friendly. The house sits next to a police station and there is off-street parking across the street.,,,,,

31796,8153928,2013-10-18,4673906,Claude,Hermina is a very welcoming hostess. The atmosphere at her home was friendly with people coming from different countries. The house is very close from the metro.
31796,8237293,2013-10-21,9375678,Scott,"I had an excellent stay in Hermina's house. I was in the basement, and it was very comfortable. Clean and quiet. It is a very short walk to the T's red line, so it was easy to get around Boston. Neighborhood is a little sketchy, but I felt safe (plus she is next door to the police station). I had the pleasure of meeting Hermina and she was quite attentive to whatever I needed, not that I needed much. I would definitely consider staying with Hermina again."
31796,8492193,2013-11-02,9614270,Lester,Absolutely beautiful room and the basement is very spacious. Close to the train line. Will definitely come back when I'm in town.
31796,8586568,2013-11-06,6949851,Mira,"When we stayed there, Hermina was out of town than we did not have a chance to see her. Her house is located in a convenient location. We used the basement room which is spacious and comfortable. Overall, we had a very good time there. Thank you, Hermina."
31796,8657323,2013-11-11,834941,Megumi,"What a beautiful home. Our room was spacious and we met some great people while staying there. Hermina and Donna even provided breakfast for us! It's not in the centre of Boston, but it's a quick 20 minutes subway ride to downtown. Thank you for letting us stay!"
31796,8802524,2013-11-18,8779853,Jean,"As my first AirBnB booking, everything went very smoothly. Instructions were very clear. The place was very tidy, clean and spacious for me and 3 of my friends. Highly recommended!"
31796,9085572,2013-12-05,725100,Terri,"My 2 daughters and I spent one night here. We had the basement room. No one was around when we got there so we let ourselves in and proceeded to basement. The house is big and beautiful. Light was burned out so we had to use cellphone light to make our way downstairs. The smoke detector needed a new battery so it beeped all night. A very nice women named Donna came to make up the bed and told us that we were the only ones staying at the house, which apparently was not the case because we heard people upstairs later that night. There was no lock on the cellar door so that was a little sketchy. Otherwise, for the price it was acceptable, clean, etc. so for one night it was ok. I don't knoe what  the other rooms were like, as we did not really look around upstairs except in living room which was very nice."
31796,9117761,2013-12-08,8853887,Gabrielle,"Parfait en tout point ! Maison bien conçue, bien équipée, très grande chambre, propre, hôte agréable et attentif. Je recommande absolument !"

31796,11733567,2014-04-14,4989504,Jake,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and was receiving excellent service, BEFORE I even arrived on site! There were four of us travelling, and Hermina was considerate enough of the size of our group to offer to move us to a more accommodating room! When I arrived, I did take a look at both rooms: the one I initially booked, a lovely room by my reckoning, and the room we were moved to, the attic room, which included an extra bed. The house itself was beautiful, in a quiet neighborhood. We were a four-minute walk from the train, so we were able to reach our destination in the city within 20 minutes, as well as a grocery store and restaurants VERY nearby(special shout-out to Hi-Fi Pizza down the street- those guys were awesome, and made a great pizza, fresh, at midnight!)."
We were also pleased to meet Donna,Hermina's property manager. She worked extra hard for us,and was incredibly friendly,a real treat to anyone lucky enough to cross her path.,,
"In short: Convenient-to-the-city location by transit(and free parking!); food nearby; beautiful home; ...I want to say \"\"cozy\"\" room here",but that would give the impression that it was small,which was not the case - we just felt very at-home,very welcome here; INCREDIBLE service,from the moment I contacted Hermina to the minute we checked out,we felt that our needs were more than met.
I cannot recommend this place highly enough,and hope to stay there again,should I visit Boston again next year.,,,
Thank you so much,Hermina.,,,,
Thank you so much,Donna.,,,,
This is an excellent choice of stay,and I encourage anyone to choose it.,,,,

31796,12707789,2014-05-08,3932821,Greg,"Hermina has created a really lovely place in her Dorchester house.  She offers a well decorated, well designed, well thought out and well run Airbnb operation which offers value as well as a convenient location for many Boston area destinations.  Donna also does a great job helping manage the place and the whole experience was even more than I hoped or expected."

31796,14451796,2014-06-19,16640726,Josh,Thank you to Hermina and house manager Donna for a nice stay in Dorchester.  We appreciated the clear directions on how to arrive at the house and found it to be clean and orderly upon arrival.  We finished our one night stay with a nice breakfast.  Thanks for everything!

31796,17831974,2014-08-18,15818677,Alban,La maison et la chambre d'Hermina sont vraiment très propres et très spacieuses. Et on est à 5 minutes à pied du métro. On a passé un très bon séjour.
31796,18032780,2014-08-20,17055010,Aether,The room in the base is spacial. Just a reminder that the house locates aside of a police station so it might be a little bit annoying when their car got out with siren. The rest is all good. It is easy to park the car right affront of the street. It is about five minutes walking distances to the Metro station and express buses.
31796,18177254,2014-08-23,875784,Keith,"L'Auberge Espagnole is really awesome!! We were in the Room A (2 adults and 2 children) and everything was clean, a lot of space, quiet, big bed, a little place to take our breakfast in our room, big kitchen with everything. The location of the house was at ~20 min with the red line from Boston. I truly recommend this place to everyone who wants to visit Boston."
31796,18499729,2014-08-27,9123719,Lena Lyngholt,"Very nice house and the room was really nice and big. The neighbourhood is a little bit dodgy, but close to the centre of Boston (only 15 minutes by train). I would definitely stay there again if I come back!"
31796,18818551,2014-09-01,18993871,Daniel,"The house was very nice and clean and was beside the police station and a temple.  Our room was very spacious and had one bed for each of our three guests! Hermina was not there during our stay, but Donna was very responsive to any questions we had.  The house is very close to the metro station and I would not hesitate staying there again in the future!"
31796,18894322,2014-09-02,18941173,Ivelina,"Hermina was very helpful and the information provided before our trip was very detailed and precise. The place was very nice - clean and pleasant. If I visit Boston again, I will definitely contact her. Thank you!"
31796,18972938,2014-09-03,19455162,Aaron,"Hermina was extremely hospitable, making the check-in process extremely easy. The house is absolutely beautiful. The kitchen and living room is a huge perk, and the house allows for great privacy between guests. She was completely understanding of all of my needs. I will certainly be interested in booking this place again next time I'm in the area."
31796,19036214,2014-09-05,11649796,Stéphane,"It was well located: close to the T-red line for us to easily go to Boston and it was easy to go out towards Cape Cod where we were heading since the I93 was close. The room was maybe too big for the two of us but it was comfortable. The weather was very hot and humid so we were happy to sleep in the basement. We did not meet any of of our host, Hermina and Donna, the house manager but the instructions we're clear so we encountered no difficulties."
31796,19372642,2014-09-11,12420102,Eileen,"\"Listing and description accurate, neighborhood was very close to T- very easy walk. Overall good affordable alternative to other accommodations. Basement room has a glitchy lightbulb, but a flashlight easily guided the way.  Toilet needed fixing and was taken care within a few hours. Lots of friendly guests to interact with that were also staying in house. Breakfast was adequate and appreciated- milk and cereal. Just a suggestion to post \"\"quiet early hours\"\" as the heavy constant traffic on stair case by other guests was a little disturbing so early in the am"
31796,19429553,2014-09-12,20272118,Eglė,Good place
31796,19592201,2014-09-15,16062290,Brian,"The room we rented was very spacious and even better than expected.  The room did not have air conditioning, but this didn't matter because the weather was cool during our visit and the room was located in the lower level of the house (an oscillating fan was included).  The neighborhood is a bit on the sketchy side, but the location was just down the road from the T station.  The location is very convenient to the airport with free public transportation from the airport.  So, overall, the experience was pretty satisfactory for a really great price.  I would book again."
31796,19712027,2014-09-16,10557160,Alex,Hermina was communicative and was available to respond even later in the night. She treated us respectfully.
31796,20015530,2014-09-22,14815054,Marie-Pierre,"I stayed with my mother at Hermina's place 3 nights in September 2014.  On my way to her place, she sent me a message saying that I would stay in Room C rather than in Room A ( the one that I reserved more that a month ago). At first I thought that I would get a similar room."
From South Station to Fields Corner ( the nearest metro station ) it takes around 10-15 minutes. Her house is also very easy to find it is 4-5 minutes from the metro station and there is a yellow arch in front of her house. You can't miss it.,,,,,
When we got into the house we found out that it was empty. Hermina told me that she would not be there previously and that a Housekeeper ( Donna) would be there. I found out later on a post-it on the fridge saying that she only gets in the house a few hours during the day to clean up. When I got to our room ( room C) I was very appointed. The room was in the attic,a place better for storage than for people to live in (in my opinion).  There are also no fire exits. It was nothing similar to the room I reserved. To get to the attic,we had to take a very steep staircase. Even if she is in good shape,I didn't like that my mother had to take it. In the room,we could not stand up because the ceiling was too low.  We were too tired when we arrived that I decided to make arrangements with Hermina in the morning to change room. I did so and she offered me a 30$ refund rather than switching room. I asked for more,she did not agree but she apologised for the inconvenience. I finally accepted the refund.
Downstairs,the kitchen and the living room are perfect for travellers. We could help ourselves for breakfast which we really appreciated. However,my mother found a few mouse droppings on the kitchen counter ( yes,yes...),,
The decoration of the shared rooms ( kitchen,living room,bathroom) are great.,,,
"I really think that making us change room a few hours before we arrive is not professional. We saw the other rooms and they look perfect and we would probably don't mind the small details if we were not obligated to change room at the last minute. I know that my review look severe but that's the truth. Voilà!\"",,,,,

This particular space is huge--has a queen bed and king bed and small couch. Could sleep lots of people.,,,,,
There are several rooms in this house,but each has its own lock. With 2.5 bathrooms and a miniature sort of kitchen area downstairs (fridge/microwave),so not too much competition for these things.,,,

Hermina was there when we arrived and really friendly. Bathroom is shared with room H. Walls are a little thin, but quiet hours were honored. And you can basically come and go as you please. Location-wise we never had a single problem, day or night. It's in a thriving and diverse part of Dorchester that has large Vietnamese community . Really good place for breakfast/Bahn Mi is Dippin Donuts. And the T to the red line is less than a block away. Just turn a corner and you're there. We would definitely stay here again."

It felt a little chilly getting into our room first but we shortly put the heat on and felt much better.,,,,,
My husband wished for a brand-new looking sheets and towels; I personally along with our sons were satisfied and found everything to be decent and warmly cozy!,,,,,
"When we came back in the evening one of the other guests in the upper floor had locked the door from the inside and would not respond to the bell.

The host will provide you a very detail and clear instruction before you arrive.  The METRO is near the house and easy to find CVS.

31796,33157850,2015-05-25,32831144,Elizabeth,"This place was adequate for one night. The house was easy to find and  very convenient to Boston. The surrounding areas and access to the nearby beach was the best part. As for the house itself, there was plenty of local parking and the host was pleasant. We did not have a key that worked to our room and so we could not leave our belongings there. Although Hermina tried to get the key to work, in the end we felt our stuff was not secure."
There is no cleaning fee for a reason. We shared a bathroom and the people we shared with were slobs. They did not clean their area up. We found their personal belongings everywhere. That was not the host's fault but be aware when sharing common areas. The other issue was,we were in the basement. You can hear every step from above,and if you are not a morning person,i wouldn't do the basement. I'm new and i wasn't sure if she just assigned me the room or I could have had my pick. As soon as i paid,i saw my room was A. This may have been my error,"so not putting too much issue into it. \""
31796,33880517,2015-06-01,21582136,Harini,I would say this was the most comfortable and safe stay we had. The directions were truly appropriate and  the neighborhood was awesome. The host was very welcoming and made all necessary arrangements for stay. Myself and my husband had to spend a very reasonable amount when every one else from the data science conference had to take up hotel for a minimum of $200 per night. I would definitely pick this place if I go back. again and highly recommend
31796,33937572,2015-06-02,2678903,Kelly,Hermina was super friendly and flexible when we wanted to invite some friends over. I didn't really get a sense of the neighborhood but there's a few bars and good Vietnamese food around. Perfect place to stay if you want to save money and want to meet other travelers!

The house and room were exactly as shown and described in the ad, right down to the police sub-station behind the house and the Buddhist Temple across the street.

Contamos con lavadora y secadora en un área común dentro de la hermosa casa de Hermina, baño  compartido sin molestia de ninguna clase con los otros huéspedes."
Hermina nos orientó muy bien sobre las diversas actividades culturales que ofrece la bella ciudad de Boston,y nuestra comunicación fue fluida y cálida.

Room A is large, cozy and the beds are comfortable.  There were no issues with us arriving late or needing to store a bag after checking out. We would definitely stay here again."
31796,39863547,2015-07-26,12002272,Micah,"The listing is accurate.  We reserved Room A, and we were put in Room A of the house.  The other house guests were very nice and helpful with questions we had."
The house is only a 4 minute walk from the T station.  Location is amazing.  There were plenty of places within walking distance to grab food.,,,,,
The host was not present during our stay,and the email she sent detailing the how/what/who of getting in to the property was slightly disorganized.  In it,she told us how to get to a different room than our reservation.  She also didn't let us know how to get in to the building,so we had to ring the doorbell until someone opened the door.  That guest provided us with the info on how to get in,and everything was smooth after that.,
The room was very comfortable and even had its own private mirror and sink.  It was a fairly quiet location,and it happens to be right next to a Boston PD substation so safety wasn't a concern.,,,,
Overall,we would stay here again.  While communication was prompt at times it was disorganized.  We were able to deal with that,though,"and everything was smooth.\"",,

Hermina always replied very quickly,very friendly and  helpful when I ask about any questions. Her description on how to get to the house from airport,subway station and other directions was very detailed,so we found it without any difficulties.,,
(URL HIDDEN) We lived in Hermina's house for 3 nights,But we haven't seen her,Maybe we went out in the morning and returned home in the evening. But we feeled that someone must have been to clean the room during the day. The house itself was very clean and the room is very space and comfortable.,,,

Very close to the red T line which makes it easy to commute to Central Boston area.,,,,,
Hermina responded very quickly when I got there and the room I was allocated wasn't ready due to late departure of previous guests.,,,,,
I was very quickly given a different room which was even better then the one initially allocated.,,,,,
I only stayed for one night but enjoyed the experience.,,,,,

The house is clean, comfortable, well-furnished, and has easy access to central Boston via the T.

Hermina is very nice she invited me to have dinner with some of her friends and have a really good time.,,,,,
They were others guests in the house but they are not bothering at all either if I had to share the bathroom I didn't have any problems and always find it free.,,,,,

31796,47522196,2015-09-20,43009348,Arnold,"The stay was ok, but it was not what we were expecting.  We did arrive early and she allowed us to rest even though they were not ready for us.  The bedding was a futon and there was a second bed positioned/laying on the floor, so that was a little out of place.  Also, right in front of the police station or substation and every police car that left had to run the siren.  For one night, it was good, but if you are staying three or more, might have reconsidered.  One very positive area was that she contacted me immediately after I sent an e-mail prior to arrival, so I was very grateful for that."
31796,48208640,2015-09-24,12408346,Lorraine And Bruce,the host was initially good on email but a room change left us walking into a room with other people's things in it.  Our room had been changed and though the host was very apologetic it meant we had to drag our 2 heavy suitcases up attic stairs.  Bed linen was clean but the room itself was pretty shabby. The neighbourhood didn't feel safe at all.  We chose this as it said free onsite parking but the host used this and the street parking was a tow away zone.

Various spiders and milipedes in the shared cellar-bathroom, waterpipes located near ceiling of cellar - loud flushing everytime s.o. of the upper floors showered or just used water. Wouldn't recommend the location for a comfy stay."

The location was a bit too far from the main boston area and at first I was worried about how to commute. Good thing there is PLENTY of UBER in boston, and to travel to and from dorchester cost about 7 dollars one-way. I did not use pubic transportation other than form the airport to air-bnb."

The Neighbourhood from what I could tell was quite safe (Hermina's house sits between a police station and a monastery so you cant ask for safer lol) and clean,there are a few people at traffic lights asking for money but they are harmless.,,,,

31796,79277939,2016-06-12,76179232,Eduardo,Hermina was very helpful adjusting to the times I was arriving. The room was exactly as was listed and was perfect. Overall great experience.
31796,81703228,2016-06-24,3719238,Eve,"I never met Hermina, but her place was beautifully decorated, and everything worked as promised. We found a great Vietnamese place nearby for dinnet the first night. Street parking was plentiful. All in all, it was just what we needed."
31796,82348807,2016-06-27,65292942,Jimmy,"Great location close to the Red line. Hermina let us know ahead of time that she wasnt going to be able to be there to greet us but gave us very detailed instruction as to how to get in. She responded to our questions within 24 hours and checking out was a breeze. The description for the place states there was AC (which was 1 of the reason why I booked it since Im a walking furnace), but there was no AC in the room. Luckily for us, it was a colder evening than expected and a ceiling fan was sufficient to keep the room cool. Overall it was a good stay and would come back again."
31796,82607074,2016-06-28,77190140,Viet Cuong,"There no welcome, and not much support."
The room is changed from 2nd floor to basement.There no air conditional so the air make me feel not fresh.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
31796,82871512,2016-06-30,77715716,Xiaoying,It is a basement room. Very large with a private bathroom. Everything is clean. Hermina was not home that day but we had no problem getting in the room. The whole house seemed to have been rent to different people. It is about 20min drive from Boston. Glad we found it in the last minute.
31796,83666613,2016-07-03,2099230,Gonda,"We liked the place. The room is big and there was everything we needed. It is close to the subway, the supermarket is just down the street. Everything is clean and well kept."
31796,84348340,2016-07-06,66606267,Simon,"Very good value for Boston. But very busy house in morning and evenings.suitable for young people as accessible to town and great price,but not great for a family with little privacy"
31796,84685087,2016-07-08,21405110,Florent,"It was a great trip in Boston, with a comfortable and spacious room very well located. Always flexible, Hermina could help one of our friends."
31796,85827543,2016-07-13,66203215,Seth,Hermina and Sue were both very friendly and welcoming! Private Room B was very clean and well decorated for the price. There was some noise from the street but it was still very comfortable.
31796,86203889,2016-07-15,2648993,Ness,"Hermina checked in with me before arriving, was very helpful when I arrived quite late with two sleeping kids, including helped me bring my suitcase down, which I greatly appreciated. The beds were made with clean linens and fresh towels were set out. The space itself was quite large, and we appreciated the hospitality."
31796,86760797,2016-07-17,73219111,Kevin,Stayed for two nights and had a very comfortable time. Host was friendly and willing to help with anything. House is just 3 minutes from train station. Best location to stay since it's just a 15-20 minute train ride to Boston.
31796,87803957,2016-07-21,67804566,Jim,"Listing erred in that on site parking is in question. Hostess was otherwise gracious.  Accommodations are sparse; poor lighting, mildewed shower and sofa bed not for sleeping."

31796,89265607,2016-07-27,41887300,Nial,"Herminia, was welcoming and friendly, without being intrusive.  The house is located in a nice residential area and is close to the T line station.  Room A is a big basement room with two beds and a sofa bed, which was nice and cool during our summer visit. There is a separate bathroom in a room located off the main room accessed via the laundry room.  I do believe other guests have access to the laundry room."
31796,90447472,2016-08-01,33626583,Cynthia,"Great directions. Clean, shared bath worked out pretty well. Laundry included soap and was coin operated so bring quarters.   Room A was very spacious in the basement, cool  but air was not on. Bed and futon were comfortable and shared the open area with sink and tea area.  Very comfortable.  Parking down the street.  Ethnic area would be fun to explore if more time."
31796,90999233,2016-08-03,67654153,Pat,"Clean well kept, enough street parking. Could use better ventilation.  Ok if u want a place in Dorchester area or easy access to subway n can't find a lower cost acceptable place"
31796,91281441,2016-08-04,55358654,Hee Doe,"I was not satisfied at all for the room and the services. The bedroom, bathroom were dusty and not clean at all."

5834930,38234828,2015-07-13,36816445,Erika,"I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Marissa in person, however we communicated via text, which was perfectly fine. Her roommate was home for our Friday - Monday stay -- he was very quiet and was no bother with sharing the bathroom/apartment. I enjoyed the neighborhood and there was a convenience store next to the apartment building."
Her bedroom is not the room shown in photos,however the new room is bigger and included a couch,both a nice surprise. She left out two bottles of water,which was delightful.,,
I would have liked the bathroom and bed sheets to be a bit cleaner. (The bathtub had tiny hairs and particles,and there were few stains on the bed/pillow covers). Marissa kindly provided bath towels,however my sister and I opted to use our own. I booked with Marissa the afternoon before coming into town the next morning,due to circumstances,however if a listing is open for booking I feel it should be clean for guests.,
"Outside noise can be heard while trying to sleep. Overall I felt I was in a safe neighborhood and Maria accommodated our check-in/out times with our flight schedule. \"",,,,,

5834930,44073752,2015-08-23,12424769,Katie,"Marissa's place was lovely. She was out of town and left the key with the security guard. There was no issue with getting in without her there. We parked under her building, which was charged per hour (24 hrs, $35). I'd suggest researching for cheaper parking. The apartment is located across the street from the T Train, which allowed easy access to any part of the city. Marissa was in contact our entire stay checking in. She also gave a few suggestions for activities, restaurants and nightlife."

The room worked great,no frills,but everything was comfortable and clean. Because of the great location,it was a little noisy at night,"but otherwise I couldn't have asked for anything better.\"",

2423613,13996027,2014-06-09,16238481,Cathy,"Tiffany and the after-hours service were helpful and responsive. The room fit what I needed. I was at a class for a couple of days, worked from the room another day (I have my own internet services), and visited with my daughter and her boyfriend the rest of the time. This was much less expensive than hotels, had bed, TV, microwave, mirror, small desk, refrigerator, bureau and access to a shared bathroom and shower bathroom. I never ran into anyone in the halls the whole time. I stayed a week in early June 2014. The T subway station is a 5-minute walk away - very convenient, though I mostly walked everywhere. The neighborhood is beautiful, and this is close to Long Wharf (half hour walk), the Commons and Arlington Gardens (10-minute walk), which then lead to Newbury St. (upscale shopping and restaurants), Little Italy (10-minute walk?). I'd stay there again."
2423613,28803982,2015-03-30,22241633,Seleta,The neighborhood was very nice. I had several flight delays and got into Boston much later than I expected. The 24 hour key service was very prompt and got me set up in no time. Tiffany had arranged printed material for me so that I could get around the next morning. The room worked really well for my needs.
2423613,31660553,2015-05-08,9276325,Roxane,"Tiffany has been very accommodating and easy to communicate with before and during my stay. The facilities however were quite old and old fashioned, not always functioning nor comfortable."
2423613,32232207,2015-05-16,7043569,Nikhil,"This was a great location and an awesome price for a stay in Boston. I was able to walk to Faneuil Hall, theatre district, Copley Square all within 20 minutes. The room was very clean and the bathroom and shower next door were very clean as well. I didn't spend much time  in the room except to sleep as I was at a conference and then out to dinner nightly. It was very hot the first night because of an early heat wave so Tiffany was kind enough to have an Air Conditioner installed the second day which made sleeping much better. So over all a great cheap place to stay when you are visiting Boston for a conference or business. The room is a little sparse for lounging around for long periods. It was super quiet, I barely saw anyone. It had a very comfortable bed and a great sleep."
2423613,33005341,2015-05-24,7525180,Johan,Basic room at great location. Shared bathroom. Clean! Helpful service!
2423613,33442984,2015-05-28,1757969,Hiro,"Generally the room satisfied my needs: having a place to stay at a convenient location for my business visit to Boston.  I enjoyed the location the most; I always wanted to find a place to stay in the Beacon Hill area. At the same time, I was disappointment about my experience of checking in. I did not have my check-in instruction, and I had to find my own way to get into the room.  However, I appreciated your quick response to fix the problem."
There were two things I realized that did not help me during my stay.  First,the weather was unusually hot in Boston,but I was not able to use A/C because the unit was too dusty,and made my cough.  I was also bit by a bedbug,and had a mark on my arm for one week after returning from my visit.,
My overall experience find the place to be satisfactory,and the host was very responsive to my request.  I am sure my case is an exception,"and everyone else seems to enjoy staying at the place.  It was just unfortunate that I ended up to be the exceptional case. I hope everyone else will have better stay here. \"",,,

2423613,34428537,2015-06-08,31355824,Jörn,Trotz meiner sehr späten Ankunft war die Schlüsselübergabe für Tiffany und ihr Team kein Problem.

2423613,39091511,2015-07-20,23722098,William,"I had a great stay in Boston.  Although we didn't get to meet, Tiffany was very helpful arranging the key drop-off, providing helpful information about the neighbourhood and also checking in on me during my stay to make sure everything was going OK.  The room was quiet and an ideal base for exploring the history of Boston."

I walked through Boston Common (park) to the downtown area for meetings at a hotel about 15 minutes away.  The locals who utilize the park at all hours were entertaining and I never felt unsafe.,,,,,

Some may take issue with the pillows. They are pretty thin so may want to bring your own.,,,,,
The location is amazing.,,,,,

950046,5965040,2013-07-24,6347643,Carol,"A beautiful home in Jamica Plain! We loved staying here and indeed loved the whole area. The apartment is really spacious and very convienient to subway, parks, restaurants and shops (all within around 5 minutes walk). Everything we could possible need was there and we enjoyed the art and the interior decor very much. As mentioned it is over three floors and not suitable for very young children or anyone with mobility poblems. We arrived during an excessive heat warning and the house was very warm, however we were able to keep the bedrooms cool with fans and the window a/c units. (Though we were glad when the temperature came down after a couple of days!). Highly recommended."

There were three of is and we originally opted to stayed in a one bedroom appartment but a few days before we arrived they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom, which meant no one had to sleep on the couch! This was a much bigger appartment which was greatly appreciated! During our stay one of the column heaters started leaking but we called the maintenance guy and he came over within the hour, we had to wait a little longer for a plumber which was a little bit annoying as we were about to head out but all in all it was fixed quite quickly which was great! We also tried contacting the owning through message, call and on air bnb about te possibility of a late checkout 2 days before the date, however they never replied which was a little annoying so we just checked out on time. Overall it's a nice clean appartment in a very good location, I would stay here again!!"

The apartment's perfect for 2,a bit cozy for 4 (we didn't) with the living room futon. The WiFi was flawless and everything there worked fine and was exceptionally clean.,,,,
One caveat - the one fairly short flight of stairs was narrow and somewhat steep,so if that's an issue for you,be aware of that.,,,

Our favorite part about this place was it's AMAZING location. A 5 minute walk from the T, you could be virtually anywhere in town within a matter of minutes. We have paid much more to stay in the suburbs of Boston which was extremely inconvenient. The Melrose apartment was as convenient as we could ask for. The owner was extremely helpful and made sure we were satisfied with our stay, especially by making sure we knew it was a small place when we first booked before charging us. We had a slight problem with the key and the owner answered right away and helped us out. If you are like me and use your lodging as a place to sleep and shower when you travel, this place is for you! We had a wonderful experience and would definitely stay there again."

The flat was superbly located and had everything that we needed.,,,,,
All the main attractions were a short walk away.,,,,,

4518710,39295300,2015-07-22,32250001,Andrés,"Yo me alojé en el apartamento de North End, en Little Italy. No esperes una maravilla, porque ni mucho menos lo es."
2 camas,una cocina,y un baño que casi no se le puede llamar baño.,,,
Además,es un bajo y nos entrábamos de todos los que pasaban por la calle y todos los que entraban o salían del edificio.,,,,
Si no le pides mucho a un alojamiento vacacional,quizá te pueda valer.,,,,
Lo bueno es que está muy bien situado. Todo el centro lo puedes visitar andando y,si te apetece andar un poco más,también el MIT y Harvard.,,,
El agua caliente,aire acondicionado y la tele funcionan bien.,,,,
"No creo que me quedara otra vez en este apartamento si volviera a Boston.\"",,,,,
4518710,39414852,2015-07-23,929325,John,The accommodations were great and very conveniently located. The team at Boston Furnishing was very helpful and on top of things. I would definitely rent from them again.
4518710,51423527,2015-10-20,28591141,Marielby Mercedes,"We did not stay in the unit pictured, but in another one in North End. It was perfect for us, very comfortable, clean and exactly as advertised. The neighborhood is really pretty, short distance walking to a lot of important places in Boston. The host (Jan) was really nice, he always answered quickly everything we asked him,  the key pickup/drop off was easy. If we come back to Boston we will love to rent this unit again."
4518710,51701659,2015-10-24,31780270,Samantha,"The host contacted me in advance with all relevant info. Place was exactly as advertised, quite spacious, perfect location. Extremely comfortable during stay. Would stay here again! Thank you!"
4518710,52571888,2015-10-31,1298606,Alison,"All our check-in arrangements were made by email, and there were no problems with collecting the keys. The apartment is in a great part of Boston - Melrose is a residential street with very limited parking, but there are parking garages on Arlington St if you need them. (The obvious flip-side to being in such a good location is that there is quite a bit of traffic noise from Arlington, so if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs.)"
The apartment itself was even better than I was expecting from the photos. A good kitchen,lounge/dining,comfortable bed and a fantastic shower (as hot as you could want,with great water pressure).,,
"I was in town for a conference - it's about a 35-minute walk to BCEC - and it was nice to have a \"\"home\"\" to come back to in the evenings. There are lots of restaurants within walking distances",as well as both green and orange T stations. There's also a big Star Market (supermarket) on Huntington Ave,which is about a 10-minute walk.,,,

4518710,72568280,2016-05-03,26208953,Gabriela,"The pictures seem to be from two different apartments, we stayed at the 62 Melrose House, which is located at a walking distance from Boston Back Bay train station. The street is really beautiful with old brick houses and very quiet. It´s also near the park and the beginning of the Freedom Trail, which allowed us to explore Boston without taking public transportation. The building doesn´t have an elevator and the staircase is a bit narrow, not a problem for us as it is only the floor above the ground floor, but it could get a bit complicated for old people."
The apartment is spacious and a old,with a equiped kitchen (bear in mind there are no cooking ingredients as sugar,cooking oil...). Everything was clean when we arrived and even though we didn´t meet the host personally we had no problem finding the key.,,,
One of the bedroom curtains was broken so the room got a lot of light,early in the morning. Also the ceiling light of the bedroom didn´t work but there were three lamps,"so it wasn´t a big deal.\"",,,
4518710,72880653,2016-05-05,44425541,Natalie,"This apartment was exactly what I needed for a quick overnight trip to Boston! The location is on a very cute cobblestone street, and the apartment itself was very clean and organized when I arrived. One of the blinds and one of the lights in the bedroom were broken, but neither was a big deal for me."
4518710,73285860,2016-05-08,2874538,Michael,The apartment was perfect; in just the right location and just the right size. Communication was easy and helpful. Directions were great. Enjoyed our stay & would be happy to go back. It was the best shower in the world.
4518710,77577101,2016-06-01,35003259,Dieter,"Mit der Wohnung war ich mehr als unzufrieden. Ich würde diese Wohnung als “Schrottwohnung“ bezeichnen. AIRBNB sollte das, was als Wohnung angeboten wird vorher fachlich überprüfen. Wenn AIRBNB das gemacht haben sollte, betrachte ich eine positive Bewertung als dilettantisch. Ein AIRBNB-Mitarbeiter sollte einmal einen 23 kg schweren Koffer eine ca. 70 cm breite und steile Treppe herauftragen. Die Bausubstanz ist ca. 100 Jahre alt. So alt sind die Fenster mit Einscheibenverglasung,  Dank der zentralen Lage an einer Hauptverkehrsstraße wird man morgens ab 6:00 Uhr vom Verkehrslärm und den Einsatzfahrzeugen mit Sonderrechten früh aus dem Schlaf geholt. Die Elektroinstallation wird z.B. mit einem Zugschalter an der Deckenleuchte realisiert. Die Toilette war undicht, das Abwasser lief über die Bodenfliesen bis zur Tür, echt ekelig!! Das Handwaschbecken hatte die Größe von zwei Handflächen und Ablageflächen für Wasch- und Reinigungsutensilien liegt faktisch bei null. Der Nassbereich war eine reine Katastrophe. Aufgrund der Holzbauweise ist kaum Schallschutz von Decken und Türen zum Treppenraum vorhanden. Der von uns nicht genutzte Flachbildfernseher sollte wohl das Ganze retten. Ich betrachte so eine Vermietung als unverschämt und unzumutbar. Wenn das das Geschäftsmodel von AIRBNB ist, kann man von einer weiteren Nutzung oder Empfehlung von AIRBNB nur absehen."
4518710,89037922,2016-07-26,3558709,Leona,"I booked this place last minute looking for a place to stay for a two night work trip to Boston. While the apartment is fine, it wasn't a particularly nice place to stay. The apartment was clean, but felt very old and like the bare minimum had been done to furnish it, i.e. lowest level rugs, sheets, towels. Everything worked, but it wasn't a very pleasant place to spend time. Very synthetic sheets with a strong odor from whatever detergent was used on them.  Location seemed okay, but the area immediately around the building was very quiet and deserted at night. It did what it needed to do, but I didn't really enjoy staying there and wouldn't choose it next time."
4518710,89955946,2016-07-30,10890520,Valerie,"Vieil appartement légèrement rafraichi et non insonorisé situé dans un vieil immeuble typique de l'architecture de Boston, dans une rue charmante entre les quartiers très sympas de Back bay et de South End, à une rue de l'autoroute (donc extrêmement bruyant) et à 10 mn à pied de Boston public Garden."
Propreté moyenne (serviettes tachées,couverts sales mais l'appartement était propre).,,,,
Contact rapide par mail avec l'hôte mais ne s'est pas déplacé. Nous n'avons pas eu de draps pour le canapé le 1er soir et avons dû attendre que la femme de ménage en apporte le lendemain.,,,,,
Le système de récupération des clés est assez facile.,,,,,
Nous ne recommandons pas cet appartement aux personnes qui sont sensibles au bruit et en attente d'une excellente propreté.,,,,,

4518710,90634666,2016-08-01,41827701,Katie,The apartment is small. The one bed is comfortable. The futon would work for one adult or maybe two children. We could not access the internet while staying here. Location is great. Easy access to metro. Next to busy street but very quiet. Quick drive to airport. Easy walk to Copley Plaza or Boston Common.
4518710,91278101,2016-08-04,64833713,Keona,"Great communication with host. The apartment was as described in a great location, close to public transportation. I would definitely stay there again!"

He was also very flexible and allowed us to check in early on the day of our arrival. The apartment was exactly what we needed, and we didn't experience any issues. The location was excellent, and we were able to walk everywhere. I would certainly stay here next time I travel to Boston."
4518710,99647130,2016-09-05,85944175,Katelyn,"Fabulous place to stay. It's cozy but three of us fit with very comfortably with everything we could need. Great location, everything was super walkable, including a few restaurants within 2-3 blocks away. Hosts were super helpful with very quick responses to queries. Check-in was so easy. Extra bedding for the futon was super comfortable and a/c in each room was great for private sleeping with temperature control. Would highly recommend."

1881298,8676630,2013-11-11,7186815,Meagen,"Everything you see and read here is spot on! Caitlin was easy to communicate with and provided us with a great overnight stay. Her home is super convenient to the hotspots around JP and to public transportation options. She offered good recommendations about local venues to check out and places to explore, which there are plenty of. A little tricky to find the street on your first try if you're using (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps, but common sense or a phone call to Caitlin will get you there by your second try! I'll certainly try and book again when I'm back in town."
1881298,8711648,2013-11-12,1256078,Sahar,"Caitlin's spot is a sweet gem. A private apartment on a beautiful, tree-filled street, it is cozy, clean, and super comfy. To start, the bed is uh-may-zing! Queen, memory foam, plushest blanket--we never slept so well. We arrived late evening, and Caitlin was very flexible. It was great slipping into bed with a tea and falling asleep to the faint music of win chimes. In the morning, we headed into downtown JP, which is just a quick ride, away though there are cafes and restaurants nearby, with directions in the room."
"We were only there a night but were very happy with our experience there. Thanks Caitlin!\"",,,,,
1881298,9870281,2014-01-15,9645181,John,This studio became my home from home for 5 days. Very comfy (especially the bed) and I enjoyed the attention to detail that Caitlin has put into the place.
This is the great thing about Airbnb: you get a room that is better than a hotel for a fraction of the price. Offstreet parking was useful (this is a quiet and safe area). Caitlin responded very quickly to all my emails.,,,,,
"Morning coffee sitting on the decking was a bonus. Thanks Caitlin.\"",,,,,
1881298,9969829,2014-01-21,1167048,Erik,"We had a great stay with Caitlin. The room is very comfortable and clean with a large, new bed.

We stayed in the studio for 6 nights and found it warm and comfortable during some pretty cold weather. As others have said, location was excellent for the T. We felt the studio could have done with a bit of a better clean and a general spruce up. Also, a few extra items in the kitchen, such as cutlery and proper plates and bowls, wouldn't have gone amiss. Overall, it's not luxury but is good value."

Although we never met her, she was incredibly welcoming. The apt space is exactly as pictured, incredibly clean, cozy, and super close to public transportation. It was clear Caitlin paid close attention to detail, including variety in pillow types and blankets, Boston map drawn on the wall, plates, cups, and utensils, and an offering of teas and coffee beverages. Also, we had a car and Caitlin's apt has a driveway! This was our first airbnb experience and it was wonderful, I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a conveniently located and affordable place to stay."

Caitlin and her husband were super-duper nice, and they genuinely cared about my stay. The studio was super cute and cozy, the perfect size for two people. The only thing I would add to the room is a TV (not sure where it would go), but everything else was great. There is a cute little kitchenette and a table with 2 chairs for dining. There is a small closet to hang clothing. It does get chilly in the space, but there are 2 heaters to keep the place warm. I feel like I really got lucky with this place and the hosts. Caitlin texted me to ensure everything was OK and I had everything I needed, which was great. I highly recommend this place to anyone. It’s very private and super cute, and in a quiet neighborhood. And there is even a parking spot!"

I came to town for business and had never tried airbnb before but was told to check it out by others. I think I would use a hotel next time for my own desired conveniences while on a trip tht isn't leisure oriented.

1881298,16544419,2014-07-29,14174328,Crystal,We had a fabulous stay in Boston. This was a perfect location to easily take the T for our adventures all over the city. We would highly recommend staying here.
1881298,16607449,2014-07-30,6985109,Geoffrey,"Cait and Dan have created the ideal launch pad to explore Boston! The room they provide is clean, comfortable and private, along with having a private bathroom and kitchenette. By far my favorite part is the incredibly helpful and beautiful map of Boston painted right on the wall for easy reference to subway lines and major landmarks. Its short walk to the subway seals the deal as a great place to stay on your upcoming adventure to Boston. Thanks Cait and Dan!"
1881298,17199229,2014-08-09,9645992,Meagan,"Great place to stay! Especially if you are interested in using the train system. You can be in the middle of downtown in no time! The room was very clean and had fresh towels. It felt very private! Never even met Caitlin and Dan, but didn't have a reason to I suppose! It was all very easyI would definitely stay here again."
1881298,17431737,2014-08-12,13782893,Allison,"An absolutely wonderful place to stay. Very convenient to the T and all that JP has to offer. The studio itself is clean, beautifully decorated, comfortable, and completely private (we actually never even met catie and dan). I would recommend this place to anyone traveling to boston who is looking for something a bit off the tourist path. Would definitely stay here again!"
1881298,17675340,2014-08-16,15276284,Sander,"We had a great stay @ Dan&Caitlin. The room was clean, had enough space and it was just a 5 minutes walk to the Subway."
1881298,17751165,2014-08-17,450534,Katie,"We only stayed with Caitlin for one night, but my sister and I enjoyed our visit. The room was really lovely with plenty of space, a comfy bed, and a nice bathroom. It was also great being so close to the metro, which made it easy to get around. We only met Caitlin briefly, but she made sure we had everything we needed for our stay."
1881298,18048101,2014-08-21,5573397,Jerry And Michelle,Our stay at Caitlin and Dan's place was everything we expected and more.  It is just around the corner from the Orange line which takes you into Boston.  We took some of the suggestions they made and spent some time at the Dogwood which is also around the corner and found ourselves ending most of our evenings down at Eugene Oneill's.  The apartment is cozy and quiet.  The bed is very comfortable.  We met Caitlin and Dan as they were leaving for the evening when we arrived.  We had a long day and they were very accommodating for allowing us to check in late.   This place is a hidden gem when wanting to visit Boston and the surrounding areas.
1881298,18648736,2014-08-30,10962971,Janneke,"This place is just great! A lot of privacy, great bed, bathroom was nice (with great shower gel and shampoo). Its very clean and we felt very safe. It is also on a lovely street without any noise. Location was very close to the forrest hills T stop. I didn't meet caitlin in person but she was very quick and nice in responding. I would come here again and would recommend!"
1881298,18871007,2014-09-02,13343734,Anu,"You can't beat the location of this place, it's a 3-min walk to T. The neighborhood is pleasant and quiet, while being so accessible to downtown Boston. Caitlin and Dan made us feel very welcome with their interactions over email, as well as with the interior design of the room. The amenities in the room were very comfortable and well kept, with a private entrance and a nice sit-out area. We loved our stay in Boston, would not hesitate to book the same place again when we go back."
1881298,19066950,2014-09-06,12361040,Gesche,"Wir konnten das Appartment nach Caitlins und Dans Beschreibung problemlos finden und auch hinein kommen. Das Appartment ist sehr schön und hat auch eine eigene Terrasse, was beim Frühstück toll ist. Die Lage ist auch nahe an der Ubahn, was gut ist, auch wenn abends die Gegend um den Bahnhof etwas dunkel ist. Wir haben die Gastgeber leider während unseres Aufenthaltes nie gesehen, aber hätten sie über Telefon und Email jederzeit erreichen können."
1881298,19405111,2014-09-12,13687871,Ines,Prompt and perfect information how to get there and the place itself was just as advertised. We enjoyed our stay in Boston and can really recommend it. Thanks and we would come again. Very comfortable bed!
1881298,19587842,2014-09-15,2563831,Cathy,Very nice little studio with all comfort. But we didn't meet Dan and Caitlin.
1881298,19999452,2014-09-22,4483613,Rob,Helpful hosts met us as we arrived.  Comfortable room.  Convenient to the T.  thanks.  Would stay again.

1881298,20327593,2014-09-28,13442927,Christian,"Very conveniently located to the metro this was a nice spot to explore the beautiful town of Boston.  The appartment has all that is necessary, unfortunately we met no-one at our arrival but could nevertheless move into our room as access was provided according to the description of the place. Thank you for letting us stay there!"
1881298,20552167,2014-10-01,18312893,Inge,"We stayed here for 3 nights when we arrived in Boston to start our New England trip. We were welcomed, although we were late, by Caitlin and Dan. We loved the fact that the house is in a residential area. The T/subway and a good breakfast opportunity are a 5 minute walk away. The T brings you in about 15 minutes to Downtown crossing.  The studio is clean and big with a very comfortable bed and shower! And for the people who find it very important.....there is a very good WiFi! We can really recommend this place."
1881298,20809045,2014-10-06,11275920,Diane,"We met Caitlin and Dan just as we were leaving, but they are both so friendly and helpful. They respond immediately to emails. Their place is just as advertised.  Very clean, great shower, microwave, and refrigerator. But Boston has great food, so why cook, anyway? It is a 5 minute walk up a slight hill to the apartment. It is SO quiet. There is a great restaurant, Dogwood, just across the street from the Forest Hills station. The ride into town took about 15 minutes on the subway, so if you want to be right in town, it's not for you. We enjoyed being away and in a neighborhood. We would definitely rent here again."
1881298,20920839,2014-10-07,17871432,Joshua,"The listing was certainly accurate! I unfortunately was unable to meet Caitlin and Dan due to my short time, but they made the stay very enjoyable. It was a very nice private studio. The location was literally a 5min walk to the subway which made it very easy to navigate downtown. I will definitely look at this listing again when I find myself in Boston again."
1881298,21385920,2014-10-16,20958235,Jieun Elayne,"We loved the location! It was safe, quiet and very close to the Metro line-convenient in many ways. The studio was cozy, clean and we were able to feel at home."
"Thank you for everything !\"",,,,,
1881298,21870151,2014-10-26,16027300,Lynn,"Caitlin and Dan's place was immaculately clean, and the bed was super soft and comfortable (I'm pretty sure it was Tempur-Pedic). We loved the decor and quick walk to the T – a great option for a trip to beautiful Boston!"
1881298,21952083,2014-10-27,20780663,Rona,"We didn't meet Caitlin and Dan, as they were away visiting family for our one night stay,  but their concern for their guests shows in the care they take to provide for your needs in this little studio apartment. They sent clear directions to get to their place, provided information about the neighborhood and everything you could need for your stay - comfortable bed, TV, small fridge and microwave, dishes and cutlery, lots of towels in the bathroom. There is a small table for eating inside, and another outside on the private deck where you enter. The location was very convenient, on a quiet street with off-street parking, but only 5 mins. from a busier street with restaurants, stores and the orange line which will take you anywhere. We had tickets for an event at the TD Gardens and got there in about 20 mins.   We would definitely stay here again - clean, affordable and convenient."
1881298,22157754,2014-10-31,8788483,My,The Studio
We really did enjoy our stay in Caitlin and Dan's apartment. It is in the basement of their house but still there is a lot of light coming in through the small windows. You also have the benefit of your own entrance and also your own terrace for sunny days. The bathroom was very clean and nicely decorated as well as the room/studio. We liked that every quest had a chance to mark on a map where in the world they were from.,,,,,
Good Internet connection,a bit cold in the apartment but Caitlin and Dan had plenty of extra heaters that made it really warm and cosy fast.,,,,
Our hosts,,,,,
We never did get to meet Caitlin or Dan,but they very helpful through mail and very fast in the correspondence.,,,,
Location,,,,,
It is close to the subway (orange line),Forest Hill Station,about 5 min walk. Same distance to restaurants,coffee shop and bars. To city center it's about 15-20 minutes by subway. You can also easy go by bus (39) to town if you prefer that. In 5 minutes with the bus you are also in nice neighborhood on South Street with more restaurants and shop and a laid back vibe.,,
You can go for runs our walks  around Jamaica pond,about 20 minutes walk away.,,,,
Beer,,,,,
And you are close to the Samuel Adams brewery (15 min) with some good free beer-testing :),,,,,
"It is a great stay if your not only in for staying close to the citycenter. \"",,,,,
1881298,22466504,2014-11-07,22026405,Edgard,"O apartamento é muito calmo e relaxante. Encontramos Dan somente no dia em que chegamos, mas, como eles enviaram instruções completas e detalhadas, faríamos um check-in perfeito mesmo que não houvesse ninguém em casa. Foi fácil se locomover pela cidade com acesso a metro (T) realmente próximo. Definitivamente, posso recomendar a um amigo ou mesmo me hospedar novamente, no futuro."
1881298,22695675,2014-11-12,11948028,Darleen & Patrick,"Attention to detail, care and comfort were central to our Airbnb experience hosted by Caitlin & Dan!"
Details regarding all our communications and any directions helpful for our stay were always responsive.,,,,,
Caitlin and Dan left out no details when it comes to the care and comfort of guests. Caitlin’s skillfully drawn wall maps of Boston and Jamaica Plain are fabulous ways to orientate you to the city and surrounding areas. Top notch quick bites or fine foods are also a short walk around the corner… as are green spaces for exercise and appreciating the natural beauty of the area.,,,,,
The detail of comfort is evident in their studio set up w/ private entrance. We appreciated super comfort in sleeping,quiet home and well thought supplies for kitchen and bath basics.,,,,
We are most grateful for the care Caitlin and Dan genuinely have for the comfort of their guests. Through a slight bit of effort and mutual desire we were able to briefly meet Caitlin and gain an appreciation for the completely authentic person she is,which has special meaning to us as our son lives just a few blocks away,our future visits are already feeling like we’ll be staying with neighbors more than airbnb hosts!,,,

1881298,22786965,2014-11-14,16109708,Alexandria,"Caitlin and Dan are more then professional host. I had an emergent unusual request after 6pm to book with them. They were more then accommodating for myself and my service dog. They immediately checked to make sure I safely arrived, then met me graciously at 10:30pm. Offered to carry my luggage, settled us in to the most modern studio with a private porch. My stay was fabulous. I slept for 14 hours in the most comfortable bed of my life. I do not think I ever moved an inch. I am actually moving to the neighborhood but planning to book again when I need a night away and definitely using them for when I have guest in town. This is an amazing meticulously clean modern stay with beautiful host."
1881298,22848597,2014-11-16,4809664,Pam,"We arrived at Caitlin and Dan's in the afternoon and the studio apt was open for us with a key waiting inside.  All prior communication had gone very smoothly.  The room is a good size, decorated with a nice contemporary flair, and was clean and tidy.  The bathroom was roomy and the shower water pressure was excellent.  The bed was super comfy and there was a portable heater to take off the chill, since one night it got quite cold outside.  A quick walk to the T led to an easy ride to any major area of Boston.  Jamaica Plain's great stores and eateries are easily accessible.  I got quick responses from C and D when I had some questions.  I hope to stay at their place again."
1881298,23703321,2014-12-08,23638400,Lucas,"This was a wonderful studio with a private entrance and fantastic location on a quiet street with an easy walk to the Forest Hills T, making all of Boston accessible even without a car. The hosts were extremely responsive and helpful and the room was cleaner and better stocked with towels and various shampoos and body washes than most hotels I've stayed in, and there is even a fridge and microwave. The bed was probably the most comfortable thing I've ever slept on. There were a number of small heaters that took care of any issue with the temperature quite well. There are several good restaurants a couple of minutes walk away as well as a bodega and liquor store. There's a nice grocery store on South Street about 10-15 minutes walk. Overall a wonderful experience, and I would absolutely stay here again."
1881298,23949381,2014-12-15,5942087,Alec,The Studio met all our expectations.  It was well appointed and clean and comfortable.  In our case it was very convenient and within a short walk from our children.
We highly recommend this as a good,quiet place to stay and will stay there again as we need to.,,,,

The studio is exactly as pictured. It was clean,there was plenty of room to hang and store clothes and the towels/shampoo in the bathroom were hotel quality. It's great to have a private entrance and a parking spot.,,,,
I was staying over several days,so it was nice to have the kitchen facilities,including an electric kettle,fridge,some dishes and cabinet space to store dry goods.,
It's a very convenient neighborhood - close to the T and some nice places to eat. There's also a convenience mart and a liquor store around the corner. Even though the T is close by,I wasn't able to hear it from inside the studio.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1881298,25004540,2015-01-05,19815613,Cindi,"The hosts came down and brought us extra heaters as it was a really cold few days, and there were simple amenities like toiletries, tea and coffee. Maps and brochures of attractions were also available in the really neat and tidy apartment. The apartment was about a 10 minute stroll from Forest Hills station (end of orange T line), and neighbourhood was quite nice, although there weren't that many grocery shops nearby. Overall the stay in Boston was great."
1881298,25320678,2015-01-12,993991,Mallory,"Caitlin and Dan provided a warm, welcome home for a few days as my partner and I toured Boston. They were responsive while booking and while responding to any questions we had.  We arrived early and Dan greeted us warmly, offering to hold our bags as he prepared the room. The studio was just what we needed with a comfy bed, warm shower, and unique and personal decorations that made us feel as if we were staying at a friend's home. Guests can see the T straight from the studio, but you aren't disturbed by the noise at all. Quiet neighborhood perfect for relaxing after a long day."
1881298,25905338,2015-01-29,21679258,Kuleni,"Caitlin and Dan were wonderful hosts during our stay in their cozy studio.  They responded to our emails and calls promptly and were very accommodating of our requests.  We were staying in their studio during a snow storm and they kept on checking on us, brought us yummy brownies in the dead of the storm and even dug our car out of the snow the next day - something I truly appreciated since I was recovering from surgery and could not have done it myself.  This is our very first Airbnb experience and Caitlin and Dad have made it an awesome one.   Thank you guys!"
1881298,26052937,2015-02-02,25176658,Angela,My father stayed here over the weekend while in town to see my show. We loved how close it was to the T and to me. Caitlin and Dan checked in with me to make sure he got in ok. He was happy to be so close to me and said it was perfect for his basic needs. My mother will be staying here this upcoming weekend!
1881298,26144460,2015-02-04,26924282,Amo,"﻿Dan met us and helped carry luggage down and around to the studio.  It was quite clean, comfortable and everything we required.  Since we were there during quite a bad snow storm,"
they provided a couple of extra heaters to help keep the space warm.  An electric kettle,tea and coffee along with mugs and other basic dishes were provided.  There was also a small,,,,
refrigerator and microwave for our use.  Shampoo,conditioner and body wash was also provided along with plenty of towels.  The bed is a memory foam mattress and is extremely comfortable!  The T is less than a five minute walk even in the snow!  There is a table with brochures of places to visit in Boston that is quite useful.  We would definitely stay with Dan and Caitlin again!  Overall,"we had a lovely experience with them!\"",,,
1881298,26596720,2015-02-16,25413746,William,Dan and Caitlin were great hosts! They were prompt in responding to all of my questions and even checked in on me to make sure everything was going smoothly. The room is just as described and is a 5 minute or less walk to the orange T line. The t line ran regularly and got us into the city within 20 mins. I highly recommend staying with Caitlin and Dan to ensure a lovely weekend in Boston.
1881298,27638390,2015-03-09,23816573,William,Everything about this place was AWESOME!! The owners were friendly and had everything mapped out for new guests. Had tons of privacy and commuting through Boston was made easy given its close location to the T lines. All in all it was a cozy place to head back to after a long day of hitting the streets and rest my head. 10/10 would book them again!!
1881298,27993617,2015-03-16,25375397,Jessica,"The host was in frequent contact with me days prior to the visit and contacted me the day of to make sure everything was in order. The apartment was exactly as described and the location could not have been more perfect, you could see the T from the studio window! Also, we were able to park in the driveway, which allowed us to park our car for the entire trip and just take the T everywhere we wanted to go. The host came down to meet us however we were not home. Even though we did not get a chance to personally meet Caitlin or Dan, their constant communication and quick response helped us to feel comfortable. There was various soaps, cleaners, sheets, and other household necessities provided and, though we brought our own, this was very accommodating!  I would recommend, though, either downloading the airbnb app or communicating directly with the host (their phone number rather than airbnb messaging) because there were a few times that I recieved a message on my phone and responded only to later find the full message in my email and realize I only responded to the first half. Overall, we had a great trip! Thanks so much!"
1881298,28168352,2015-03-19,27386022,Sarah,"We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Caitlin and Dan, but they made checking in easy despite being at work.  Even though we weren't able to meet them, they were very accessible and always answered our questions quickly.  The studio was very private (and incredibly clean) and had easy access to the T.  While the neighborhood wasn't the best, the fact that it was such a quick and easy walk to the T made it worth it.  It was also very private, and very comfortable.  The memory foam mattress was great, and Caitlin and Dan had multiple space heaters in case it got cold.  I loved that they gave us instructions for good places to eat and hang out in the neighborhood.  I also really appreciated that they provided us with amenities (plenty of linens, bathroom essentials, etc).  Overall this was a wonderful experience!"

1881298,28924154,2015-04-01,23227332,Carmen,Coming in to find two free passes was like receiving a Christnas present. The room looked just like the pictures. The area is perfect. I love the Orange Line. The only thing the place needs is a little clock. Caitlin and Dan's place helped make our mini-vacation feel like a dream.
1881298,29481389,2015-04-08,24935281,Larissa,We arrived a little early and Dan was able to meet us. The space was exactly as described and pictured. Everything was very clean and well taken care of. The best part about staying here was the LOCATION! The T was only a 5 minute walk away which made it easy to get to all the sight seeing we wanted to do. I also liked that we were able to come and go as we pleased without worry of bothering anyone else. This was my first experiences using AirBNB and I was very impressed.

My husband and I were visiting for the Marathon, and wanted a place a little tucked away from the craziness of downtown, yet close enough so as not to be a logistical nightmare come race morning.  This studio was exactly what we were looking for, and more!"
The hosts were not home when we arrived,but clear instructions on how to access the studio were given.  Free parking is available right on site - bonus!  We arrived to find the room so very clean,with plenty of towels and essentials.  There were even dishes and utensils for our use,and a hot water pot,microwave,small fridge and tea/coffee.  The bed is super comfy
The location is PERFECT!!  It may be located a stone's throw from the T (absolutely fantastic for getting into the city/Back Bay in about 12 mins)  but you'd never know it as it was so quiet and peaceful.  The room has a large patio to enjoy your morning coffee and breakfast,and a fabulous coffee shop and selection of restaurants are about a 3-5 min walk away.

The place is homely but shows their quirky taste and they were fantastic hosts - even dropping round homemade cookies when we came back late one evening. A great experience all round - would recommend the place to anyone looking for a fun, affordable stay in Boston. It also possesses the most comfortable mattress we've ever slept on. Worth half the fee itself!"

Caitlin and Dan's apartment was very easy to get to, it was very clean and comfortable, they allowed us to check in early, and they were easy to communicate with.  We are already talking about making a longer return trip."
Their apartment is only minutes from a train and bus stop,which made getting around town a breeze.,,,,

The next morning, they checked in on us to make sure we were OK. We had a very busy weekend, and  never really met Caitlin and Dan in person, but they checked in on us by texting. This is a nice, small and quiet apartment, which was perfect for our very busy weekend attending our son's graduation in the Boston area."

This was our first experience using Airbnb and my boyfriend was a little hesitant, but we were both pleasantly surprised at how home-y the studio was and how thoughtful our hosts were! The apartment was clean and cute, and thoughtfully decorated! The bed and pillows were super comfy, and my boyfriend was thankful for the body wash provided in the shower the next morning after realizing he forgot his. There was also a large porch attached outside with chairs and a table where we sat in the morning and enjoyed the beautiful weather! A fantastic experience, thank you!"
1881298,34515362,2015-06-09,25748584,Jane,"This was ideal accommodation for us, we arrived late and because it has a private entrance at the back of the large house, we didn't disturb anyone. It is very comfortable room with useful fridge and (URL HIDDEN) is in the basement in a house on a slope, so the back has its own deck with afternoon sun. It is easy walking to the underground into Boston plus many buses. There is a good coffee shop and restaurent and deli, so very convenient."
We met Dan who was very welcoming and helpful.,,,,,
You are also close to the Arbouretum and Forest Hills Cemetary,"very pleasant places to walk.\"",,,,
1881298,34699911,2015-06-11,26221990,Stephan,We had a fantastic stay in Boston! This was our first Airbnb experience. The apartment is very nice and just a 5 minute walk to the T line. The bed was very comfortable. Our hosts were very responsive to emails. There was free offstreet parking. A really great experience! We can absolutely recommend this place if you are looking to be in Boston!
1881298,34865684,2015-06-13,32025378,Eizel,Dan was very accommodating and very responsive to my inquiries. The room is huge and clean. The place was conveniently located near the T.
1881298,35283430,2015-06-17,1406344,Colin,Caitlin and Dan's place is a perfect place to stay for a visit to Boston.
The studio is very private,with access at the rear of the property,off your own deck.  Lots of space inside and a very comfy bed.,,,
Plenty of parking space on the drive.,,,,,
First day,we went into Boston on the T,and the orange line starts just a short walk (less than 5 minutes) from the house.  There are a number of restaurants,pubs,diners etc,opposite the station.  Still
Second day,we drove over to Cape Cod and access to the roads running to the East is really easy from Forest Hills.,,,,
As we were only here for two days,we didn't get to spend any time with Caitlin and Dan,but the were really friendly and gave us tips on the local eaterys.,,,

1881298,36079919,2015-06-25,26303310,Kara,"We had a lovely time with Caitlin and Dan, and it was a great first Airbnb experience. We had a few issues with the internet during our stay, which was a bit of a stumbling block (as international travelers we'd planned to rely on wi-fi). Nonetheless, Caitlin and Dan provided speedy feedback when we forwarded our concerns, and the studio's super comfy bed almost made up for it. We were super happy to find a ton of amenities (fan, tv and cable, plenty of towels, and dishes) and hope future guests enjoy as much as we did."
1881298,36665800,2015-06-30,31055350,Lucy,"Wonderful stay! The location is fantastic, literally minutes walk to the T. So you are connected to all the best of Boston. The studio has the T map drawn wall size and really helps orient you. The studio is clean with all the listed amenities. It's super quiet, comfortable and private. You have your own entrance and patio. The local pub (Eugene O' Neil's) is fantastic with great food and an excellent house IPA."
1881298,36972066,2015-07-03,34598613,Kim,"Just as listed. Owner, Dan, is very friendly. The neighborhood is sort of off the beaten path in a part of Boston that shows it's age. This area hasn't been updated like other parts of Boston. Nevertheless, it is a fine place to stay. Also, I had originally booked 2 nights and had to change plans last minute to one night. Caitlin and Dan were so nice giving us a refund for the second night. It is greatly appreciated."
1881298,37635174,2015-07-09,26221709,Benjamin,"Das Studio ist perfekt geeignet für die Erkundung Bostons. Es liegt sehr verkehrsgünstig, die Bahn ist in 5 Minuten zu erreichen und ist vollkommen ausreichend ausgestattet - absolut empfehlenswert!!!"

1881298,41060639,2015-08-04,28718198,Donna,Caitlin and Dan made us feel welcomed right from the start.  They made themselves available for any questions we had. The room was very close ( 5 min.) walk to the Orange Line Subway and we used this to get downtown.  We felt safe walking in this area and there were a couple of nice restaurants right across from the subway which we were able to walk to for supper.
1881298,41917174,2015-08-10,18577441,Carmen,"We had a great stay in Boston. Caitlin and Dan's place is two minutes from the T which makes it very convenient. The place was clean and comfy and just what we needed. There are some great restaurants just around the corner from where they live. We went to the Indian restaurant, the Diner and Fazenda the coffee shop. All great places. Overall, a great time."
1881298,43020275,2015-08-17,28654073,Eric,"This was the perfect space for a launching point for our Boston experience. We loved how close it was to the T really right around the corner. Caitlin and Dan were flexible about our arrival time, we were glad we got to meet them. Would recommend the space and Caitlin and Dan to anyone looking for a roomy stay with easy access to the city."
1881298,43363618,2015-08-19,29536186,Sandra,"Le studio est bien organisé et fonctionnel. Il y a une carte du monde où les invités indiquent leur provenance, j'ai trouvé que c'est une bonne idée. Il y a beaucoup de guides touristiques sur Boston qui sont disponibles. L'emplacement est à environ 5 minutes de marche de la station de métro (ligne orange). À recommander."
1881298,45075100,2015-08-31,23227332,Carmen,I love this place and want to move in permanently. Very near the Orange Line. You will love it.

Celui-ci est conforme à la description et très bien situé pour se rendre en ville (à peine 5 min de marche jusqu'au métro). L'endroit est très calme. Dan et Caitlin  étaient disponibles  et à notre écoute avant, pendant et après notre arrivée. Nous ne pouvons que recommander cet endroit, il est parfait."
1881298,47030020,2015-09-15,11860142,Pavel,The place is really good. Clean and private. Close to the metro and in like 20 minutes you in the center of Boston.
1881298,47453663,2015-09-19,13694559,Wil,"We stayed for 4 nights. Location was perfect for the T, it takes you into downtown within about 10-15 minutes. The apartment was quite small but useful, however we would not stay again since the bed was not OK. FIne for a single person, not for 2, since you would roll against eachother. I guess no problem for people who are just married"
1881298,47632407,2015-09-21,34928231,Mirjam,The neighbourhood was good near the metro station

On our arrival we were met by Dan who assured us with baggage and showed us around. The apartment itself is lovely, it's clean, very well furnished and equipped. The location is very close to a main train station giving easy access to Boston."

1881298,48979779,2015-09-30,14694179,Hari,"Well described, this compact unit was exactly what we needed (although the bed was very soft/uncomfortable). Cost effective, close to public transport - exactly what we needed for our stay in Boston!"
1881298,49416872,2015-10-04,814606,Ashley,"Due to roadworks just North of Forest Hills Station, we had some difficulty finding the property but arrived to find Dan waiting to help us and unloading all our luggage and carrying the bags into the studio. It is ideally placed for visiting Boston being close to the MBTA link. We found Caitlin and Dan to be a charming couple and would recommend them to guests."
1881298,50613361,2015-10-13,12557423,Robert And Kathy,Dan and Caitlin were very responsive in communicating before we arrived.  Their place was described accurately.  They were attentive to our needs.

The one problem we had with the shower,which was a misunderstanding on our part and not a fault,was dealt with quickly in a friendly and efficient manner.,,,
A short walk to the T underground system which took us straight into Boston.,,,,,

The location is very good with the train at walking distance, less than 5 minutes. Thank you to both of you. I highly recommend it if you go to Boston"
1881298,52207236,2015-10-27,35086202,Patricia,"Enjoyed our trip to Boston and our stay with Caitlin and Dan at their B&B on the hill. It was as nice as the photos advertised. Loved the local map on the wall, a very nice touch. Improvements could be better directions from the transit station, better lighting on the walkway, and a heater for the bathroom. Otherwise, it was perfect. Spoke with Dan several times and he was very helpful. We give it four out of five stars and would definitely stay there again if we were in the area. The Pierce Sisters"

1881298,60264029,2016-01-21,11868914,Jessica,"Excellent price for a private spot in Boston, and truly right on the T! Dan was nothing but helpful settling us in, as well. There is a TV with cable and (lucky for me, I needed it) a clothing iron and a hair dryer! I always appreciate when places consider these things for guests. There are some great little places an easy walk away - coffee shop, good Indian food, a liquor store. We knew the bed would be super soft from the reviews - you sink all the way into that memory foam! So, if you want a firm mattress, this ain't the place. But a nice spot overall - would stay again!"
1881298,61304070,2016-02-02,18303376,Keira,"Caitlin and Dan are amazing hosts. Their studio is beautiful and the perfect size for a getaway for two. It's sheltered away from the city, but right next to the metro when you want to go in. I loved that there was a parking spot as well in the driveway so I wasn't worried about leaving my car. One night we accidentally locked ourselves out pretty late and they were readily available to help us get in. It was an amazing stay, would totally go back again."

1881298,61904487,2016-02-09,13313436,Stephanie,"We really enjoyed our stay in Jamaica Plain! We thought we'd be a bit early, and the hosts let us know they'd do their best to get the place ready for us quickly. We ended up showing up on time and Dan was waiting outside for us, shoveling snow and pouring salt (we arrived during a snow storm). Dan showed us the apartment and basically told us everything we needed to know about what to see and do in Boston and how to get there on the T. Very helpful."
The apartment was small and comfortable with a private entrance off the back patio. My husband ended up with back pain from the soft bed,but I thought it was comfortable. To each their own! The apartment had all the nice little touches...soaps and shampoos and toothpaste and lots of towels in the bathroom,coffee available to make,a tv with cable,and was nicely decorated There was a storm the day we left and our flight was cancelled and they so kindly let us stay past our checkout time until we could get a flight,which was very much appreciated. .
The only minor problem we had was with the temperature - eventually I realized someone had set the thermostat to change to 62 degrees throughout the day and night - WAY too cold for us,but I was able to fix it and we stayed warm after that.,,,,
The location was nice - lots of places to eat within walking distance and literally 2 minutes to the T.,,,,,

1881298,63450777,2016-02-23,480822,Julian,The studio is very nice and comfortable. Public transport can be reached within 5 minutes. We will definitely stay with Caitlin & Dan again if we come back to Boston.
1881298,64048663,2016-02-29,4419076,Louisa,"Dan and Caitlin's studio is very comfortable, clean, private and welcoming. I found it a perfect base while in Boston for a conference -- the very close T stop made it truly ideal."
I'll chime in on the bed thing. Some people think it is too soft,and other people like it. Here's my take: it's a memory foam mattress,and there are people who like them (comfy!) and people who hate them (weird! soft! too hot!). It is on the soft side for memory foam,but personally,"I found it ok. \"",
1881298,64824334,2016-03-08,51735952,Steve,"We loved our time staying at Caitlin & Dan's studio. Jamaica Plain is great and really well situated (walking distance to Sam Adams Brewery). The studio was clean, homely and we will definitely be coming back. Oh and the bed is amazing! Now we need to get a bed like that for our house."

1881298,65573528,2016-03-15,50327240,Sarah,"Caitlin was very quick to respond to any questions I had regarding the stay. I also spoke with Dan on the phone when we got there and he was extremely friendly and helpful. The bed which is memory foam is very comfortable but took some getting used to because of how soft it was, but no complaints we are fans of cozy soft beds. Apt was a bit damp/musty when we arrived or when the door was closed for an extended time but to be expected as it was lower level and chilly out the previous week. We opened the door to the huge deck and with the breeze it was great! Extremely close to the T (orange) line, 5 min walk, which was what we needed to make getting in and out of the city easy. The Franzier Coffee shop just at the bottom of the hill across from the T had fantastic coffee and breakfast sandwiches. Overall I would suggest staying here if you need somewhere to sleep that is cute and has basic amenities, and close access to public transportation. It was clean and just as pictured. Thanks again!"
1881298,65888571,2016-03-17,57291726,Jane,"This is a comfortable, private studio that had everything I needed. It is very close to the T. Caitlin was easily accessible by email and very welcoming. Definitely a great place to stay in Boston!"
1881298,66252986,2016-03-20,61870854,S. Luckett,"Loved staying in Caitlin and Dan's cute little studio apartment! I appreciated being able to let myself in at check-in, and having my privacy throughout the stay (though the hosts were available should I have needed them), especially when I wanted to relax after full days at a busy conference. Access to the rest of the city via the T was convenient and easy. The bed is comfy, the apartment was clean, and there were lots of clean towels and facecloths in the bathroom. I appreciated the toiletries, kettle, dishes, and utensils. The wifi was quick and connectivity was good."
My only (very minor) complaints were 1) the apartment smelled kind of musty at first,which was probably to be expected as the apartment is partially underground and there had been a lot of wet weather in the preceding day. This cleared up after the first day. 2) The temperature one night was crazy hot. Once I saw that the thermostat was set to 73,it was easy enough to correct it and get back to sleeping comfortably. Just look for the thermostat on the wall by the bed!,,,

What I appreciated the most is how the hosts kept in communication via email and txtmsg to confirm arrival time, need for parking, etc. They were very attentive. The site itself was lovely.

I would certainly return, especially since it is close to my friend's place in Jamaica Plain and very accessible to the T (metro/subway)."

The location is so great, literally 2 minute walk from the T and a 10-15 minute ride to down town.  Not to mention the great coffee shop and restaurants that were just down the hill.  I would most definitely recommend staying here and we would try to stay here again the next time we're in Boston!"

He was generous with advice about where to go & what to see, both in Boston and in the immediate neighbourhood. The accommodation has a nice private feel, and is decorated and equipped with great style, not forgetting the especially comfy bed! The area is currently being dug up, but we found several nice places to eat nearby without any trouble despite the roadworks; the pleasant neighbourhood of Jamaica Plain is a manageable walk away too.

1881298,78685352,2016-06-08,9951694,Sandra,Caitlin and Dan's apartment was perfect for our stay in Boston. It is located a easy five minute walk to the subway station. The apartment had everything we needed to be comfortable. It was clean and tastefully decorated. The bed was super comfortable! I highly recommend this Airbnb!
1881298,78885742,2016-06-09,38346777,Simeng,"超级漂亮的房间,门在院子后面,是单独的。房间布置超级温馨,床也很舒服。在波士顿的日子也因为订了这么好一家房间变得很愉快"
1881298,79434933,2016-06-12,53966967,Laura,"Apartment was exactly as described and pictured. Very comfortable, clean, and safe. Having the kitchen area was also very convenient. The only thing that stopped me from giving this a 5 star rating was the smell and air inside the apartment. It smelled of mildew and mold. A humidifier might help to clear out some of the stagnant smell. I would wake up with a bit of congestion due to the mildew. Overall, this was a great place to stay for our Boston trip. Convenient to the subway- once we found out how to get there due to construction. LOL!"

"The super comfortable bed was exactly what we needed after flying across the country. And the walk to the T took all of 3 minutes. Such a great spot!\"",,,,,
1881298,80808338,2016-06-19,12784190,Luc Et Chantal,Nous n'avons pas rencontré nos hôtes durant notre séjour mais le nécessaire avait été fait pour que nous prenions possession du logement.
Seuls petits bémols : nous aurions apprécié un réfrigérateur avec une partie freezer car nous avions une glacière avec des freeze-packs que nous n'avons pas pu re-congeler compte tenu du fait que nous n'avons pas pu rencontrer nos hôtes. L'équipement du studio est un tout petit peu juste en vaisselle et il manquait un torchon pour l'essuyer...,,,,,
Rien de bien grave en tout état de cause.,,,,,
Une suggestion cependant,"et compte tenu de l'exiguïté du logement et de la présence d'une grande terrasse : la présence d'une table un peu plus grande et de chaises confortables sur ladite terrasse serait un vrai plus.\"",,,,

1881298,82232713,2016-06-26,44551555,James,"A good location, very handy to the subway and a range of shops.  We contacted Dan when we arrived but had no further contact until until we rang to check where to leave the key.  The room is of a good size, contains essential utensils and the bed is very comfortable.  However, like another recent guest we found the musty smell of the unit unpleasant."
1881298,82687321,2016-06-28,5766062,Graeme,"Very close to the Orange T Line, just a short walk up the hill to their house. The basement suite was clean and comfortable. The weather was hot and humid in Boston (almost 30 degrees Celsius), but the suite remained cool, and they provided a fan which was appreciated. The kitchenette is compact but adequate, and the fridge is nice to put all your delicious leftovers in. Just down the road near the T station there is a wonderful cafe called Brassica (which is amazing, and they have delicious breakfast sandwiches), and some pubs and a liquor store. It was a quick ride to get downtown, and Jamaica Plains is nice to explore too. The area is really cute and quiet, but accessible. Bathroom was big and clean, nice shower. And the bed is really comfy! I'd definitely recommend staying here!"
1881298,82860169,2016-06-29,59418448,Ronen,Great place to stay at Boston.
We really like the privacy.,,,,,

The bed was incredibly comfortable, definitely my favorite part! We did get a little warm (it was a particularly couple of hot days in Boston) but we were able to open the main door and have the fan against the screen door to cool us down as soon as we came in. We only met Dan briefly when we first arrived but he was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed. If we get to visit Boston again in the future I'd definitely hope to come back here!"
1881298,85496377,2016-07-11,2068589,Shoba,The instructions provided by the host were helpful before got into the apartment. Very impressed with the attention to details on how the apartment was maintained & kept ready for the guest. The best part was to provide reference of a local restaurant which was to our liking of cuisine during the stay. Overall very satisfactory experience..
1881298,86093583,2016-07-14,43452737,Regina,"Staying at this Airbnb was delightful!  Just as it was described, it was near the T and easily accessible to shops and walking areas. Coffee and packages of hot cereal were provided along with some bathroom amenities.  The little apartment is beautifully done, with a lovely little outside porch.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would cosider this place again."

1881298,87427686,2016-07-20,20490190,Susie,"Although we never actually met Caitlin and Dan, their communication and instructions made check-in a breeze.  Current construction in the area--new public transportation terminal--made getting in a bit challenging.  But the accommodations are clean, comfortable and very private; and the area has the up-and-coming urban charm we had hoped for.  All in all, a very positive experience, and we would definitely return."
1881298,87973651,2016-07-22,40836583,Monica,"Good location, only a short walk to the T-line. Basement studio is very cozy and clean with your basic essentials. Nice to come back to a very comfortable bed after day of exploring the city. We had a rental car so being provided with parking in the driveway was a definite convenience. Area felt safe and quiet with easy accessibility to all Boston neighborhoods. Had a great stay and would gladly recommend."
1881298,88404972,2016-07-24,77406629,Benjamin,Well done map with chalk to give the layout of Boston. Really nice to be able to walk in with keys on counter because we got in so late.

Centre de Boston rapidement desservi (30 minutes). Seul bémol – le studio ne comprend pas: sel, poivre, sucre, vinaigrette et torchon. Une épicerie bio se trouve à 800 m du studio mais les prix sont relativement élevés. Je recommande cette location !"
1881298,89448991,2016-07-28,74255556,Brian,Super clean space that felt like a small apartment with its private entrance. Hosts have created a very nice space and provide all the extra touches to make a great stay. As noted in the other reviews the location is great just off the Forest Hills T stop (orange line). No air conditioning but a nice portable fan is provided. Bed is comfortable foam and bathroom is very nice. You won't be disappointed with this property.
1881298,89647055,2016-07-29,23316339,Dan,"Very pleasant, small room, memory foam mattress. Clean. Friendly host. Good location"
1881298,90691886,2016-08-01,7099422,Thaddeus,"Conveniently located and cozy basement studio.  Dan was friendly and welcoming, off-street parking was tight but convenient, bed was comfortable, decor was attractive and well kept.  We didn't hear any noise from neighbors but some city noise from the busy street below."
Only complaint is the lack of ventilation - the only fresh air is via the front door (which has a screen door) but there's no apparent way to have fresh air when sleeping or away - and the studio was a bit on the warm side during our visit.  This brings me to my biggest complaint - the studio smelled a bit of mildew,"presumably due to the lack of (bathroom?) ventilation.  Those who are sensitive or allergic to mildew should consider other options.  It would be great if the hosts could make one of the windows operable and/or add a bathroom fan.  \"",,,,
1881298,92721380,2016-08-09,81269692,Anika,"Dan is a very nice host and the little studio is just perfect for a city trip, clean, comfortable and everything you need in the little kitchen. Restaurants and bars are nearby which Dan suggested. Would always come back!"
1881298,92956403,2016-08-10,63431169,Katelyn,"Great apartment in the basement of a house with a private entry.  Very quick walk to the T. Caitlin and Dan offered many recommendations for food and fun in the area which was very helpful. The space was very comfortable and clean. We wished we had planned to stay longer. While there was no AC, we had no issues with using a fan to keep the space cool. Such a fun space and would definitely recommend!"
1881298,93184418,2016-08-11,68909428,Rachel,"Our stay couldn't have been any nicer. Very clean space, they had everything you could have possibly wanted/needed. It exceeded our expectations. Great neighborhood, very private, really close to the T (about 5 mins)."
1881298,94772101,2016-08-16,11376000,Juan,This location was amazing! Caitlin and Dan thought of everything we could possibly need for our stay.  My girlfriend and I felt immediately comfortable and at home at this location.  It was a great place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing.  The location is really close to public transportation and there are a few great food locations nearby.  I highly recommend this place!
1881298,97303025,2016-08-26,55403306,Dana,"We very much enjoyed our stay. Hosts were readily available to answer any needs. Really appreciated the privacy of the studio and it's outside porch/deck! Also, the easy access to public transportation was a big plus. This made exploring the city and getting to the convention center extremely easy and much less expensive than driving and parking. It was quite warm and humid in Boston while we were there but the fan provided in the room made this more bearable."
1881298,98615535,2016-08-31,27185706,Peggy,"Caitlin  was very accommodating allowing us to drop off our luggage early so we could enjoy the day in Boston. She also helped us  with directions. It was a wonderful location close to the subway. We enjoyed using the subway to get around Boston.   It was a warm night and it was hard to sleep without air conditioning. There is a fan that helps, but there are no windows that you could open.  Overall, a good value."
1881298,98864758,2016-09-02,65290173,Chantal,gorgeous studio! Dan and Cait were very prompt and flexible with us as we were moving out from my apartment.

The unit was beautiful and spacious, and the host was very kind and responsive to all our requests. It is also super-close to all kinds of shops, restaurants and cafes which are just one block away! Overall this was the perfect stay, and I highly recommend this to anyone visiting Boston!"

6017574,56885334,2015-12-19,17596653,Sophie,"Charming. Right on Commonwealth avenue walking distance from lots of shops and cafes. Very nice kitchen, lovely seating room windows looking out over the central strip"
6017574,60883931,2016-01-29,47962062,Naemi,"I have stayed in this apartment for a month and it felt like a second home from the very first second. It might be on the expensive side, but is worth every penny. I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to take in as much of Boston as you can.  For longer stays it is ideal, as the neighbourhood has so much to offer and makes you feel like a local with all amenities needed. Yet being so central you can reach all parts of Boston and all tourist spots within minutes."
This apartment is right next to Newbury Street. So you litteraly have all kind of fashion stores,supermarkets,restaurants,day spa,yoga and barre places,french bakery and cafes right around the corner. At the same time all bedrooms are facing a quiet alley for rest. To watch anykind of sports in a crowd you have two cool Sports Bars one block away (I became a NFL fan!). The T and Bus are a 2 minutes walk - you will get directly to Camebridge and Harvard if needed. For runners: charles river esplanade is 3 minutes away.
The house and apartment are exactly as shown on the pictures. The kitchen is fully equipped,all is very clean and the guest room is even larger and with more daylight than you might think from the photos. You will have cleaning and washing equipment,basic household equipment and various sets of nice cotton bathtowels. I like the modern feel yet coziness of the space which gives you an immediate feeling of being home. Same goes to the communication with Brooks living right next door. The welcome was very warm and the whole communication before and during the stay is supportive,easy and focused. Good balance to make you feel part of the house community,being safe and equipped while having your privacy.,
In fact I liked the place so much,that I often stayed in and invited a friend for dinner. And I always got the jealous look for the apartment :o). You will also get two sets of keys,in case you will have someone visiting.,,,
I will definitely come back.,,,,,

The location is fantastic, with a neighbourhood feeling, close to multiple attractions, restaurants, cafes, a good supermarket, playgrounds, but also touristy things like the Duck Tour starting point. The flat itself is light, spacious and nicely decorated. Brooks was a wonderful host. We've had a few small issues that she tirelessly worked to resolve asap and in no way these issues spoilt our stay. We left her with a small list of suggestions that we are sure have already been fixed. We would happily stay there again."

The area is quite, but you can find some good bars and restaurants in close proximity ( 15 min to walk). Marlo gave us a number of hints where to go during the day and also for the evening.

14682931,99475454,2016-09-05,53929278,Oystein,"Lori is a fantastic host offering exactly what the ad says plus a bit more. The room was as clean and fresh as the pictures indicate, nicely decorated, comfortable, and with views out to a calm street. The place is a short walk away from the 'T', so getting to central Boston is no problem, but you get to stay in a more tranquil area of the city. The shared bathroom and kitchen were well stocked and free for use, and when your host provides a jet lagged traveller with homemade dinner and fresh fruits and berries for breakfast, it is a place that is hard to beat."
2043529,14704751,2014-06-24,16106245,Holly,"We booked this apartment due to location, and it was indeed a great one!  This is steps from Hanover Street, a main destination in the North End of Boston. We easily walked everywhere we wanted to go, including the waterfront, Boston Yard (20 min walk), and Quincy Market area. Interactions with the host were easy and straight forward.  We didn't interact much, as the process was pretty streamlined.  All interactions were pleasant and professional."
We were two couples traveling to go to a wedding a couple hours outside the city,so we didn't have a lot of time and Boston and wanted to make the most of the time we had.  Staying in this central location was a great way to do that. The only drawback was that we had to find parking for our rental car,and there is not parking available at this location (something we were aware of before booking). We were able to find parking about 10 minutes away in a lot for $28 per day - expensive in my experience (living in the South),but pretty reasonable compared to other lots in the area. You certainly would not need a car,however,if you were only going to be exploring Boston.
"The apartment itself was great. The only complaint would be low ceilings - my husband is 6'6\"\" and had to watch his head in a few spots. We were worried that there was no AC",but the apartment is on the bottom level,so it stayed cool throughout our stay (temps outside were in the 70s and 80s). The two bedrooms were almost identical which made picking one for each couple easy.,,,
All in all,"our whole groups enjoyed our stay and were happy with our accommodations!  \"",,,,
2043529,20523793,2014-09-30,21182248,Karen,"Jan is an excellent host. She upgraded me to apartment 1R so this review relates to that unit.  There was some confusion at first getting the key and Jan was responsive and helpful getting me the key. The issue with the key once I figured it out was my fault. The black mailbox where I was instructed to pick it up was a little confusing (my issue not Jan's). When I opened the mailbox all I saw was a small hole to return keys. So I looked in the other box and of course it wasn't in there. when I returned the key I realized you can open the top of the lid that has the key hole drop. So basically upon arrival I didn't realize I needed to open 2 box tops. The apartment is in a great location. It is well kept and very clean. The beds are comfortable. It is in an old building which I find quaint however, if you are looking for modern this is not for you. The shower is a pretty small stall and the window just look at other close brick buildings however, that is not unusual for old buildings. All in all I recommend this place as a good value, comfortable, clean and great host."

So many good restaurants and eateries within walking distance. Freedom Trail, TD Garden, Faneuil Marketplace are all within walking distance."
Check in and out is super easy.,,,,,
There are extra bed linens and blankets provided which is needed because I'm not used to the cold Boston Spring. There are heaters in every room which are also helpful.,,,,,
"A few things to note. This building is old and this is a basement apartment. The ceiling is low. I'm 5'7\"\" and I can reach the ceiling with my palm. I can hear every footsteps from the tenants above.\"",,,,,
2043529,29545409,2015-04-09,22534190,Emilio,"everything in that place is perfect. only one problem: there is no parking,and the parking lots  are not cheap."
2043529,29964971,2015-04-15,20101154,Paula,"Perfect location to stay if visiting Boston, right in the heart of little Italy.  Apartment great space for family of four with all facilities we could ask for. Fantastic host & very helpful with our requests & communication.  Our arrival & departure were a breeze and all in all made for a wonderful stay - couldn't recommend this location & host any higher. Thank you"
2043529,34691033,2015-06-11,26086400,Frank,"While the general location in north Boston is great, the unit is a dive.  To reach the unit you go down metal stairs that haven’t been painted for who knows how many years and around a series of pipes to a door kindly described as uninviting.  The dungeon like low ceiling two bedroom unit looks to have been fitted into an old storage area or boiler room.  It does not resemble the photo in the listing.  The bottom of the windows is inches above the pavement and junk in an alley.  You can’t open a window as there’s no telling what alley roaming critter may jump in.  The uneven floor gives everyone an opportunity to trip and fall.  The peeling paint bathroom doesn’t even have a toilet paper holder.  The bathroom door casing is rotting at the bottom and passing the rot onto the door.  The shower has black mold like stains throughout the caulked corners.  The kitchen features an eclectic mix of cups, glasses, plates, pots and pans however no wine glasses.  There is no exhaust fan above the gas range.  The TV looked like it was bought second hand twenty years ago.  The bedrooms were interesting.  One with no closet, a chair for an end table and duct tape to keep the window together.  The other with a tiny unfinished closest..  While the cleaners did what they could the place was still a dive.  I have the photos."
2043529,35659398,2015-06-21,16722248,Jessica,"Great location, steps from the waterfront and steps from Hanover Street. It fit my family of 5 quite well."
2043529,42662934,2015-08-15,22715560,Tom,"The apartment was spacious and in a great location. It was clean and had all the necessary amenities. It wasn't quite as well decorated/attractive as the pictures suggested, but was perfect for a short stay."
2043529,50833815,2015-10-15,37840618,Teri,"This was our first AirBnB experience and it was great! Host provided excellent instructions on how to get the keys. We were so close to downtown, walked or took the subway everywhere. To accommodate our long stay, we had to stay in 2 different apts. They were right next to each other and they provided a place to lock our luggage while the room was getting cleaned. We 1st stayed in apt 1R. It was 2 bd, 1 bath in the back so it was very quiet. You could hear tenants above walking but that's to be expected in apt living. Decor is nothing like what is pictured, it was a miss mosh of stuff, not inviting at all. Shower was very small."
Our second half of our stay was in apt 1F. It was a 1 bd,1 bath,again very small shower. It was located in the front of the building so not so quiet when other tenants came and went through the main door at all hours of the night. In the kitchen/dining room/living room they had a daybed that my husband slept on due to the main bed not being very comfortable.,,,
"Convenient location. Great place to be if you want to be close to Little Italy and about a 10 min walk to downtown and it was 15-20 min walk to the TD Garden.\"",,,,,
2043529,75015781,2016-05-18,13256401,Jeff,"It is a quaint space, but it is in a basement apartment.  So you can see pipes in every room and sometimes hear them.  It's a decent place to stay for one night, but if you need more morning light when you wake up, this may not be the place for you."
Easy access to pick up the key and the location is awesome if you want to be in the heart of little Italy in Boston.  Paul Revere's house I believe in just a few blocks from the place.,,,,,
"Be careful in the morning when the lights are out as there small ledges where you could slip.  \"",,,,,

2043529,76762963,2016-05-29,22255132,Guiga,"All necessary information was provided ahead of time by email, key pickup was easy and nearby. The apartment isn't furnished as advertised - it's not worse, just different. It's also lacking in windows, but that's to be expected from a basement unit. It does however lead out into a courtyard that, although not picturesque, does come in handy over the course of the day or night. The ceilings are low but more cozy than cramped, except above the entrance from the hallway. Check-out time is unusually early and we didn't notice until someone walked in while we were packing our things. Nonetheless, they were very friendly and gave us time to get organized."

2043529,93238801,2016-08-12,70412788,Austin,"Our stay at this location was absolutely perfect. We were in Boston for a concert at TD Garden and needed a place to stay for the night. The location was perfect, within 15 minutes walking distance of the garden. It's located in little Italy right near the water with parking a 5 minute walk away. The actual apartment was great. We had originally requested another apartment but it had been booked on one of the nights we needed it. To my surprise, they immediately messaged me and offered this apartment in the same building. It's in the basement, but don't let that deceive you, it's very nice. It was perfect for the 4 of us staying the night, had its own personal door to a courtyard, and was very comfortable. Check in process was incredibly easy. I highly recommend this location to anyone staying for a night or for a week. And for the price, it can't be beat. Thanks again guys"

The apartment was clean and tidy. It is Conveniently situated in the heart of Little Italy, a beautiful neighborhood with lots of day and night life. From here you can visit the best of Boston without having to cross half the city. Highly recommended."
2167993,10029490,2014-01-26,11309259,Sam,This is a great apartment for an extended stay.  It's at least as nice as it looks in the photos.
You get the entire unit -- it's spacious,nicely furnished and has an efficient layout with plenty of usable storage space.  In addition to the living room,bedroom and bathroom,there's a complete and fully equipped kitchen.  There's Comcast TV and Internet service,both of which worked fine.,
Before being converted to condominiums,the building was the Navy Yard Metal Shop.  So you get fun architectural features like rounded windows and a vaulted ceiling with a skylight in the living room.,,,,
The neighborhood is quiet at night.,,,,,
If you don't have a car,it's an easy commute to/from North Station (and therefore the T) via the regular and reliable Partners (MGH/Spaulding) shuttle buses. There also seemed to be a reasonable number of taxis passing through.  I didn't get a chance to try the water taxi to/from Long Wharf,but that's another option for getting into town.,,,
Nitzan was a gracious host -- easy to reach on arrival/departure and quite helpful with neighborhood information.  A real pleasure.,,,,,

The communication was excellent from booking to checkout. Nitzan even accepted an important overnight package for me with no problem.  Would stay there again. Great guy!!
2167993,13296317,2014-05-24,5678424,Grace,This place is the perfect stay in Boston!
I had to book a last minute flight to Boston and was scrambling to find a hotel. Unbeknowst to me,Boston hotels are extremely expensive (s place really gives you an amazing deal for you buck. You are staying in the Navy Harbour,which is 5 min walk away from the Freedom Trail. There is a bus that stops right in front of the apartment that will take you to North Station every 15 mins. You can easily take the metro to get around in Boston. And furthermore,as a frequent user of Airbnb,I can honestly say Nitzan is by far the most communicative and welcoming of hosts!,
"\"",,,,,
2167993,13949043,2014-06-09,12786887,Pam,"This is a lovely first floor 1 bedroom flat in a fully serviced building in Charlestown.  It is very comfortable, clean and well equipped. It is also very quiet, overlooking a grassed area rather than the road and with no noise from neighbouring flats. Nitzan is welcoming and helpful and was keen to ensure that we had everything we needed.  It's a great location for visiting Boston as it's only a short $3 ride across the harbour on the water shuttle to the Aquarium and downtown Boston.There's also a frequent free shuttle bus to North Station from across the road. The condo is in a peaceful neighbourhood, mainly residential, with just a few restaurants and bars within a 10 minute walk. There was a well-stocked 'corner shop' only 2 blocks away. We liked being able to retreat from the hustle and bustle of Boston at the end of the day. We felt very much at home and would highly recommend."
2167993,14817023,2014-06-27,4723520,Rachael,"This property is almost too good to be true! But, I am sure glad that it is just a little treasure that the host has chosen to share with airbnb and adventurers alike. Let's just begin with the location...we honestly wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else. It is a short (and lovely) ferry ride right to the heart of Boston and/or a nice walk to anything and everything you might want to see while visiting. It has a great, safe, up and coming neighborhood surrounded with a nice harbor walk and friendly people (and lots of cute dogs). It was nice to be able to get away from the hustle and bustle of downtown when we wanted to and yet have everything at our fingertips as well. Our host, Nitzan, was extremely helpful and accommodating upon our arrival and departure. We were greeted with a fresh fruit basket, wine and english muffins (fresh milk and oj too). The space is well laid out, light, airy, clean, modern and homey. We drove from home and Nitzan even had a parking spot available for our use (which is literally unheard of with any other property that I searched!) It felt like we stumbled upon a true gem in Boston at a perfect price point. This one is a winner!"

Everything is according to what you see in the pics,the building is a rehabilitation of an old Factory into apartments but retaining all the charm of the old building ; public áreas are modern,people of the neighborhood is very kind and polite,the place is very quite ...a perfect place to live in...,,
The location is fantastic...near some  important sites of Boston.If you like to walk you can go to the city center by your own but if don't,you have several options of public transport close to the place : bus,water-taxi(recommended just for fun...)  etc  .,,,

This place is really clean, comfortable and is a great place to unwind after a day of exploring the city. Everything is accessible by walking or by taking the ferry and you can pretty much pick up the Freedom Trail just outside the door. We were traveling with our dog and the building is really pet friendly, there is a huge dog park area behind the building and a great walking trail along the Harbor Walk for both humans and pets alike. Not only did Nitzan provide a great retreat for our visit to Boston, but he helped us remove our roof rack from on top our car so we could fit in the garage and gave us great recommendations for local gatherings and events during our stay. Nitzan is a great guy and an amazing host! Thank you, Nitzan for helping to make our trip to Boston great!"

The place allowed us to relax after spending time in the city but was a quick ride to downtown. It was also extremely convenient that we could use a parking spot as were were road tripping. We really loved boston but we totally understand from other reviews why this place is ideal when you've had a busy day and just want to be quiet and relax. Also the restaurant down on the pier is super fun and has great fish. Perfect spot!!!"
"Nitzan is so friendly and very communicative which is exactly what we needed in a host. Thank you Nitzan for a lovely stay at your place! We couldn't have asked for a better vacation. We will see you next time for some time on the water!\"",,,,,
2167993,18987726,2014-09-04,9768623,Marek,"The appartment is well decorated and located in a beautiful former machinery building. The bed is very comfortable. The area is very quiet. Parking is a little bit difficult due to limited parking spaces for non-residents. There are two cafes within walking distance which serve a good breakfast. Another plus is the harbour as well as the ferry which takes you to downtown within a couple of minutes. Nitzan was a perfect host who was responding very fast. I would recommend this appartment to anybody who prefers to stay away from the crowded tourist action. Everybody looking for a place with pubs, restaurants, etc: This is not the right place for you :)"

The apartment is exactly as described, really lovely and comfortable. There isn't a view, but you only have to walk outside and your on the harbour, its very relaxing. We used the Charlestown ferry to get to downtown Boston most days, its cheap and runs every half hour, its a 5 min walk from the apartment. We had a late flight back home, so Nizan picked up our bags and stored them at his apartment for the day, he called us a cab to the airport when we picked them up. He was very charming and helpful."

Gave us instructions and guided us into the difficult parking space, the only negative experience, and we left the car there for the whole time as we were afraid to have to repark! The whole garage was the same, very difficult, spaces were ridiculously small."

Everything was in very good order and the apartment was clean and comfortable. My questions about transport links and a foodstore were quickly resolved and I was left to settle in with an assurance from Nitzan that he was at hand for any further queries. The fact that there were none is testimony to how well the rental was organised. I made use of the local bus, the water shuttle and enjoyed the walk to North Station through the Naval Yard so it was easy to get around. The neighbourhood felt safe and the access to the Boston waterfront with its views and walks was a real bonus. I thoroughly enjoyed the rental and would use it again"

We had plenty of room for two adults and a baby and there was ample storage.  We were staying over Christmas and it was so nice to feel like we were in a nice comfortable environment when we woke up on Christmas morning.  The whole place is very homey."
Nitzan was a great host!  He met us at the building and showed us around the apartment.  He even brought us bagels and cream cheese which was extremely appreciated considering we arrived on Christmas Eve and everything was closed the next morning!  He was also extremely responsive when we had a couple of small issues crop up.,,,,,
The navy yard still doesn't have a lot of amenities (but there are a few stores/restaurants around),but it's a nice safe feeling area and it's extremely convenient to get downtown and for us to see family and friends in the greater boston area.,,,,

He responded quickly to my initial Air BnB request and throughout the process of setting up the stay, and he continued to respond immediately to texts once I was set up in the apartment.  He was flexible with my arrival and departure times, which was really helpful.  Nitzan met me at the apartment, showed me all of the amenities, gave me a tour of the building, and facilitated my parking in the garage.  The kitchen was stocked with breakfast items and coffee fixings, and Nitzan even  left me with a bottle of wine to enjoy.  The apartment is exactly as it appears in the photos, or possibly even better.  It was clean, comfortable, and the perfect place for me to live this week while I worked in Cambridge.  The building is super safe, and the neighbors were very friendly to me and my dogs (who were with me this week).  For the person traveling with dogs, there are plenty of green spaces in the area for walks, and a mulched area to the side of the building for quick runs outside.  The Navy Pier area of Charlestown is super quaint.  I had never spent time in that area before, and it is fast becoming one of my favorite neighborhoods in the Boston area.  I woke up to the sound of seagulls every morning.  This was a perfect stay and host."

We had a late flight arrival close to 11:30pm - he greeted us in the lobby, gave us a nice tour of the unit which by the way is very nicely appointed with modern furniture, all of the amenities one could desire. There were fresh organic milk, orange juice, coffee , bagels, tortilla wraps in the fridge. Place had automatic dimming lights with remote control. Nitzan has very good taste and feel for designing the space and decorating the unit to make it feel modern yet with authentic feel of Bostonian history to it. Bed is very comfortable, showers and bathrooms are amazing. Needless to say - we loved every minute of it."

Diese Zeit wird für uns auch dank der idealen Unterkunft stets in bester Erinnerung bleiben."
Nach einem langen Flug gelangten wir spät am Abend beim Gebäude im Navy Yard an,ein kurzer Anruf bei Nitzan und schon ein paar Minuten später waren wir im loftartigen Appartement. Früchte und ein Willkommenstrunk standen bereit,das Wichtigste für ein erstes Frühstück war im Kühlschrank bereits vorhanden und von Nitzan erhielten wir die ersten wichtigen Informationen zum Quartier und zu Boston.,,,
Das Appartement ist sehr ruhig gelegen,wir haben jeweils bestens geschlafen. Zum Harbor Walk und den Piers sind es nur ein paar Schritte,in 15 Gehminuten (toller Spaziergang dem Pier entlang) erreicht man die Hafenfähre,mit der man (inkl. atemberaubende Aussischt auf die Skyline von Boston) in weiteren zehn Minuten mitten in Boston Downtown anlegt.,,
Alternativ kann man den Bus Nr. 93 (er macht etwa alle Stunden einen Umweg über den Navy Yard) oder noch besser den Gratisshuttlebus des Bostoner Spitals gleich vor dem Haus benutzen,um nach Boston Downtown zu gelangen. Zu Fuss (z.B. unter der Charles River Brücke hindurch über die Schleusen zur North Station) gelangt man in etwa 30 Minuten ins Zentrum.,,,,
Das Quartier (Navy Yard) ist sehr ruhig,angenehm und sicher. Auch in der Nacht haben wir uns immer sehr sicher gefühlt (prächtiger Nachtspaziergang durch den neuen Park vor dem REHA-Spital gleich neben dem Appartement mit Blick auf die Skyline und den Hafen).,,,,
Das Appartement ist allerbestens ausgestattet,sehr sauber,hat viel Stauraum und ist grösser,als es uns auf den Fotos erschien. Wir konnten z.B. die Koffern problemlos versorgen. Ein paar Minuten vom Appartement entferntz gibt es einen kleinen Laden,in dem wir fast jeden Tag (bzw. Abend) eingekuft haben (offen bis 24:00).,
Nitzan ist ist äusserst hilfsbereit und der perfekte Gastegber,auf alle Fragen und Anliegen hat er sofort reagiert. Als unser Sohn für ein paar Tage zu Besuch kam,hat Nitzan eine zusätzliche Matratze und Bettwäsche vorbeigebracht.  In seiner Freizeit hat er uns sogar sein Hobby nähergebracht. Nitzan,1'000 THANKS FOR ALL!,,
Wir können das Appartement allen nur empfehlen,"welche die fantastische Stadt Boston entdecken wollen.\"",,,,
2167993,48444591,2015-09-26,637275,Michele,Loved this place and hated to leave! Nitzen was very kind. He took the time to meet us and show us around. The shuttle was so convenient. The place was clean and felt homey. We enjoyed Charleston and the area. Highly recommend!
2167993,50238002,2015-10-10,20658311,Mike,The apartment was great. The refreshments in the fridge and pantry were very generous and what I have decided is the best way for hosts to secure loyal repeat customers. This is my fifth rental in Boston area since Labor Day and it ranks as the best. I highly recommend staying at nitzans place.
"My only suggestion is Nitzan upgrade the cable package to include sports and news channels. \"",,,,,
2167993,50678435,2015-10-13,44878270,Christopher,"It is impossible to describe how incredible our experience was at Nitzan's place. It was so clean you could eat off of any surface. The place was stocked with enough supplies to get us through the entire extended weekend: food for the first night and day we were there, bathroom supplies, clean sheets and blankets, clean towels, etc. The parking here was extremely convenient. Follow his guidebook! Navy Yard Bistro was incredible! We drove, but also used cabs when drinking. Conveniently located, as it only took a few minutes to get into the heart of the city."
2167993,51063704,2015-10-17,34391266,Maria Del Mar,"Nitzan's apartment was more than excellent ,everything is as it is was offered ,and much more. He received us with the kitchen full of supplies, breakfast items, coffe, tea, suggar,cookies, cheese, fresh fruit and orange juice,.even a bottle of wine. We felt  very welcomed."
In the impecable bathroom you cuold find everything you needed,shampoo,conditioner,soap and more things.The flat was perfectly clean and cozy,with everything you might need.,
The bed was very confortable .,,,,,
The building is súper safe and quiet. If you are looking for a place to stay,which is quite near the city but far enough to have a silent atmosphere,so you will enjoy peace and tranquility,this is the best place.,,
Two blocks away,you can find the harbour where there is a lovely woodpath beside the water where you can go for a long walks and enjoy the boats and nature.,,,,
We 'll certainly choose it again .Thank you,Nitzan for thinking in  every detail .!!!  María and Edward.,,,,

2167993,51213628,2015-10-18,26313016,ShaQuayla,Cici assisted us during our stay in Boston.  She was absolutely amazing!  She gave us great restaurant and event advice and took the time to walk us around to the free shuttle stops.  It was a great place :)
2167993,58116547,2016-01-01,38482681,Eric,Nitzan was an excellent host. We stayed in his Navy Yard property for a lengthy period while in Boston for work. The place is beautiful; the neighborhood is terrific; and Nitzan was extremely responsive on the few occasions when we needed him. Highly recommend!
2167993,58827513,2016-01-05,44782748,June,"The apartment was a great find - extremely comfortable, well-equipped, very clean and conveniently-located. Plus the free parking was a bonus! Nitzan was the perfect host despite being away during our stay - he was flexible, incredibly responsive when we needed him and ensured everything went smoothly for us. We had a fantastic time during our short stay."
2167993,66672256,2016-03-24,52372545,Kamesh,"I stayed at Nitzan's apartment for a couple of months while in Cambridge for work.  The apartment is comfortably furnished and is as described in the write-up.  Internet access is good and the kitchen is well-equipped.  Nitzan was traveling abroad when I checked in, but nevertheless replied promptly to my messages.  He was cooperative and seemed  to genuinely care about his guests.  The garage parking space that comes with the apartment is helpful as street parking is not always readily available in the area.  I had a good experience and would unreservedly recommend the apartment to my friends and family."
2167993,68281914,2016-04-04,43539727,Ray,This is a beautiful and well-equipped condo. Having a kitchen that we could use made the trip even easier. The bed was comfy and the living room was perfect for what we needed. We had a great time staying here and walking around Charlestown and Boston. The area is beautiful and has quite a bit of history to it. There is a ferry nearby that will drop you right into the city.
Nitzan was great in communicating with us and making sure that we had everything we needed. He is exactly the kind of host that you want to have. He promptly responded to all of our needs and questions. He was also willing to work with us on our crazy schedule.,,,,,
Use the Partners bus if you can't catch the ferry. Nitzan suggested it and it is much more reliable than the MTA bus that is supposed to run in the area.,,,,,
"You will thoroughly enjoy your time here. The next time we are in Boston we will be looking this place up.\"",,,,,
2167993,69452687,2016-04-11,26442384,Lisa,"Great apartment, clean and comfortable has everything we needed and just as described."
"Nitzan was a polite and responsive host. We have great time there and feel like home.\"",,,,,
2167993,70768814,2016-04-20,44252778,Pamela,"Nitzen's place is fantastic! It's clean, quiet & close to the city, which made it very affordable to Uber around. We would definitely stay here again!"
2167993,71162424,2016-04-24,34955783,Chang,Nitzan is a very hospitable owner and provided us very detailed instruction for picking up the key and finding the apartment when he was actually in Europe. And the person who gave us the key was also very friendly and provided long list of recommended places in Boston for us to visit.
The apt is very clean and tidy. We know it is gonna be great but what we had was even exceeding our expectation! The place is very close to public commute as well as the airport,downtown. Very safe area,too.,,,
"Strongly recommend this place and Nitzan as a host. \"",,,,,
2167993,71897631,2016-04-29,3599640,Natasha,Clean and well maintained apartment. Nitzan was easy to communicate with. No issues. Clear instructions about everything.
2167993,73148871,2016-05-07,54022275,Angela,"Had a fabulous 3 night stay in Nitzan's apartment. It is beautifully appointed with very nice fixtures and fittings. We felt really comfortable from the moment we arrived. The kitchen has absolutely everything you may need,  It has all been extremely well thought out with attention to detail. This was our first experience of Air BnB and we are extremely impressed."
2167993,74565712,2016-05-15,5728763,Moira,"Nitzan's apartment was excellent.  The location was very good - an easy and pleasant walk into the city, or a ferry or bus ride.  The apartment was well equipped, quiet and a very good size for two.  Several good places to eat for dinner in Charlestown (we would highly recommend 'Fig'), just a short walk away.  And handy for walking the Freedom Trail and exploring Bunker Hill.  Nitzan was very easy to work with, responding to queries very quickly.  We would highly recommend Nitzan's apartment and would be very happy to return if we were to get the opportunity to be in Boston again."
2167993,75031885,2016-05-18,30877106,Fernando,"Nitzan was nice over texts and emails. Never met him in person, his description of the apartment and neighborhood are on par with what we encountered. The apartment is large, bright and has a great feel. Its got a nice kitchen, living space and bedroom. The bathroom is large and major plus - it has a TOWEL WARMER!"
The parking situation is tough - we drove a compact import and one of us had to get out before parking because it was so tight. Considering how hard it is to park around the neighborhood... this wasnt a big deal. The neighborhood is quiet and near the Freedom Trail / U.S.S Constitution museum. Close to major highways but not near any T lines / mass transit.,,,,,
My only gripe would be that Nitzan did not take the time meet us at anytime during our stay and did not offer any suggestions for activities or dining. It might seem petty but I have used airbnb all over the world and this is my first time I did not meet the host.,,,,,
If you are traveling without a vehicle then make sure you plan for a lot of walking - Boston is a great city to walk around and about so its not a big deal.,,,,,
I would definitely recommend this listing - its a great location,"great space and best bang for your buck in beantown.\"",,,,
2167993,77785480,2016-06-03,36813857,Lisa,"Nitzan's Charlestown Naval Yard condo is spacious, peaceful, clean and modern. My husband and I stayed for two nights as we were passing through Boston. We wanted a quiet place to rest and a great location for walking the historic Freedom Trail and Black Heritage Trail. My husband had wanted to see the U. S. S. Constitution for 36 years; it was 2 blocks away!"
We also fell in love with the North End neighborhood's culinary delights,farmer's market & European-American charm. We highly recommend Theo's Cozy Corner on Salem Street across from the Old North Church & Paul Revere's House. The breakfast & Brazillian Fish Soup is amazing (ask for the Brazilian hot sauce too)!,,,,
I awoke at 4:40 AM the first morning and wanted a safe outdoor space in which to do yoga. The neighborhood was perfect! I headed to the end of of a pier for sunrise yoga. I felt wonderfully rejuvenated,realigned,safe,and I had a beautiful view of the city from across the water as it came to life.,,
The night before,we were too tired to go very far for dinner,so we walked just 2 blocks to Pier 6 for a tasty Bloody Mary,Tuna Tartare & Fish Tacos.,,
Nitzan's place will make you feel like you hit the jackpot: incredible location,clean,spacious and peaceful. He responds quickly to texts and has an easy check-in and out process. Thank you,"Nitzan! \"",,
2167993,78059336,2016-06-05,1780459,Megan,"Nitzan was a great host and the apartment was perfect for a long weekend in Boston! While not directly on the waterfront, the apartment is in short walking distance to the Pier and ferry to downtown Boston. The apartment was clean and secure and it was great having a parking space in the garage! I would definitely recommend this location. Thanks again Nitzan!"
2167993,78979016,2016-06-10,56430893,Andrew,"Condo was great. We stayed 5 nights in June. Condo was clean spacious and well equipped and the building was very quiet. Area is clean and reasonably close to town and quiet. Nitzan responded quickly to a query. For a first air bnb experience this was great ,I have no  hesitation in recommending it"
2167993,80338222,2016-06-17,31555830,Lynn,"The Boston Wharf Condo was outstanding!  It was very clean, comfortable, and just as pictured and described.  The location is very close to the Freedom Trail, the Harbor Walk, and to a beautiful (and inexpensive) ferry ride into the heart of the city.  The condo offers plenty of privacy in a safe and quiet neighborhood, but close to many attractions.  With the cost of parking in the city, the included (small) parking spot was also a big plus."
2167993,87924066,2016-07-22,79552991,Karen,"This was our first stay in an AirBNB and we were very impressed. It was the perfect place to stay for a Boston vacation. It was within walking distance to the North End and just a few steps to the Freedom Trail. Yet, it was in a quiet, calm neighborhood that seemed to be tucked away from everything.  The condo was extremely clean and the neighbors were friendly. We felt right at home."
If you stay here and want to eat close by,I recommend Pier 6 and/or Blackmoor Bar and Grill. There is a little grocery/snack shop past the Dunkin Donuts. It's a little hidden. We didn't discover it until the last day but it was perfect for grabbing coffee,breakfast,snacks,and spirits.,
The condo is a mere 1.5 mile walk to all of the fun in the North End. We walked most of the time but did rent bikes for a day and rode all over Boston,stopping at the Boston Common and The Museum of Fine Arts.,,,,
Nitzan left very detailed instructions that were easy to follow. When contacted/questioned,he responded immediately and was flexible with our check-in/check-out schedule. If you're looking for a Boston vacation,this is the absolute best place to stay. We will definitely recommend Nitzan's condo to friends and family.,,,
"PS: Do not take a taxi from the airport. I highly recommend an Uber. The price of an Uber was less than half what the taxi charged us. \"",,,,,
2167993,91855130,2016-08-06,76559166,Susan,"What a terrific place to stay in Boston. It was convenient to the historical sites and Nitzan had an abundance of travel guides and information about the area on hand.  We decided against a rental vehicle and instead took advantage of the ferries and, with a few Uber rides in between, were able to get around, even to Cambridge, without any difficulty or significant expense. Much of the historical area is within easy walking distance. The USS Constitution is right around the corner and several nice restaurants as well. The space was immaculate,  the bed was comfortable and the kitchen well appointed for a short trip.  We look forward to returning to Boston and will definitely try to book with Nitzan again."
2167993,92888656,2016-08-10,80482258,Kate,We had a great time! The place was exactly as advertised. Would recommend.
2167993,94905580,2016-08-17,59632344,Andre,Nitzan war ein toller Gastgeber. Er war stets erreichbar. Sein Apartment war sehr schön eingerichtet und sauber. Es  liegt in bester Lage direkt am Hafen von Charlestown. Es lässt keine Wünsche offen. Wir können es jedem uneingeschränkt empfehlen.
2167993,99723046,2016-09-05,2013315,Joe And Rose,"Nitzan welcomed us upon arrival by providing an orientation to the condo in terms of how things worked -- TV, AC, lighting, key entry, etc. The condo was accurately represented in his listing--  we found it very clean and very well maintained with a relaxing decor.  It was also a super quiet building which was nice to relax in after a busy Boston day. The neighborhood was equally quiet yet you were still able to access everything you want in downtown Boston. We rode the free hospital shuttle that lets you off by North Station where you can make connections to T-stops. We also enjoyed a scenic commuter ferry ride that got us across the harbor in less than 10 minutes. We enjoyed our stay in Boston and staying in such a well-kept condo added to our experience."
4489588,22481529,2014-11-07,6379766,Bora,Great host very helpful and great communication. The Appartment it's beautiful and convenient to everything.

4489588,22777939,2014-11-14,23386513,Brian,Stefanie's place was great.  Great location in the middle of Boston.  Highly recommend staying here if you need a place to stay.

4489588,27659363,2015-03-09,17835724,Sam,Stefanie has a wonderful apartment with everything we needed.  The perk of public transport in the same building made getting around Boston a snap.  She also left very helpful hints for us to use while we were in town.

She was easy to communicate with and was willing to accommodate an early check-in after we took a red-eye flight into Boston.  Her place was so clean and cozy, and the location was amazing! Right in the heart of downtown Boston and close to everything. I would definitely recommend Stefanie as a host. Thanks Stefanie for a great first Airbnb experience."
4489588,32745172,2015-05-21,556256,Nurit,"I had a nice stay at Stefanie's. The apartment is as described: spacious, well equipped, and well located to explore Boston. I liked the small touches, like being welcomed with chocolate on the kitchen table. :) the only thing is that the apartment could have been cleaner. The floor has not been swiped or vacuumed in a while and was quite dusty which was unpleasant."
4489588,33427231,2015-05-28,5135184,Robert,"The location of Stefanie's apartment is the best. We were surrounded by great restaurants, historic sites and good transport links. We made the most of the good weather so we walked pretty much everywhere."
Whenever we had a question,"Stefanie would respond to our email almost immediately. We had a great time in Boston. Yet another great airbnb experience\"",,,,
4489588,33609872,2015-05-30,29259906,Chris,"The apartment was great; it was spacious, clean and had all the usual amenities including cable.  The best part is the location; it is a few minutes from Boston Common and is surrounded by loads of nice cafes if you want to eat something that’s not junk food.  The directions and guidance from Stefanie was also really clear."
My only regret was not staying longer in this location,I will definitely be back next time I am in Boston.,,,,

However, you should note that it is very bare, and not very homely - it's an air bed, there is only plastic cutlery and paper plates, and there are no pictures on the walls. These are small things, but worth knowing before you sign up."

The extra attention to details with the clean sheets,towels,water,fruit,and the breakfast food was great,"you made me feel at home!! Away from home. Thank you and looking forward to another great stay\""

7649517,44379165,2015-08-25,30181593,Christine,"Great location, great new apartment with amenities. I loved that they had pans, utensils, cups and plates available. The washer and dryer is a plus as well. Everything was great! Right on top of a whole foods and coffee place as well. Def will come back next time and book. My only wish is that the wifi worked. And that they had a full body mirror. But other than that. Awesome stay!!!"
7649517,46631532,2015-09-12,36125219,Christian,Everything was fine ! Thanks
7649517,47848445,2015-09-21,26871891,Kimberly,"Great rental option when staying in Boston!  The apartment was just as described & pictured online, if not better.  Communication with Flatbook and the local contact person was seamless & check-in was a breeze.  I had difficulty at first gaining access to the wifi, but after sending a quick email, I received an immediate response providing the correct login.  The space was beautiful, modern, and NEW quality construction, which means you don't hear your neighbors through the wall.  I am one that loves the charm of old Boston, but each time I stay in one of the beautiful historic hotels in the area, I struggle with paper thin walls and cramped spaces.  It was so refreshing to walk into a FULL 1BR apartment with a kitchen, living room, beautiful floor-to-ceiling windows, and a LARGE walk-in closet!  The best part for me was having a washer and dryer to take care of laundry as soon as I arrived.  You also cannot beat the convenience of having a Whole Foods right downstairs!!  I would love to stay in this apartment again and will definitely book with Flatbook for future trips!"
7649517,49047344,2015-09-30,12479725,Tom,The host was very efficient and provided reminders prior to arrival.  Apartment was immaculate and access arrangements very easy.  Great concierge service in the building.  Apartment very comfortable and well equipped an immediately above a large Wholefood Markets Store for all food and drink 7 days a week.  An easy 10 minute walk to theatre district and downtown of Boston.
7649517,50509791,2015-10-12,42232143,Amar,Good location. Clean. Okay Internet.
7649517,52495303,2015-10-30,5581973,Molly,"The Flatbook team was very responsive during the booking process, attentive to questions along the way and proactive in making sure the check-in/check-out process was seamless. This is a beautiful unit in a new-construction building on the edge of Boston's charming South End. We loved the building, from the underground parking to the center courtyard/pool area to the Whole Foods that was right downstairs! A few touches seem to have been missed by whoever does their cleaning service, but overall the place felt clean and well kept, and we would stay there again!"
7649517,53891059,2015-11-14,46079757,Citrus,The best apartment ever
7649517,54375372,2015-11-19,1701612,Anna,"Nice apartment close to the city center! We had a good time, thank you!"
7649517,54719202,2015-11-23,5537129,Myra,The apartment was amazing even better than the photos!!!! it was spotless clean and in an ideal location. We were able to walk everywhere only about 10min walk to the centre of town. There is the nicest shop downstairs where we got nearly all our meals and it has a beautiful selection of wine and beer!!
7649517,55199831,2015-11-29,19810624,Duncan,The apartment was clean and check in super easy. Close to back bay and all the great south end restaurants. Super easy stay!
7649517,55785536,2015-12-06,23503453,Tracey,The apartment was lovely and exactly as described. It is close to the metro. There is a great Whole Foods next door. Although not in the immediate downtown are everything is fairly close by and easy to get to on the metro.
7649517,59689080,2016-01-14,22143926,Emily,"We had some issues sending emails the days leading up to the stay (we are internationals so had to rely on wifi and no mobile phones), so they wouldnt let us check in until i uploaded a copy of my id, we were waiting in the freezing cold with our luggage and they just kept saying keep trying and and you can check in when we receive it. bit frustrating but we got it in the end. after this hiccup the house was very nice and modern, in a quiet neighbourhood, right about wholefoods! short walk to boston common and subways."
7649517,61338610,2016-02-02,10471493,Tucker,I enjoyed my stay but received too many emails from this company. I think I got over 8 emails leading up to my stay. I wish this company worked through Airbnb more rather than contacting guests via their company's email.
7649517,65876829,2016-03-17,11790257,Brian,"Once again, Flatbook has done a great job of making check in quick and easy."
7649517,66246650,2016-03-20,42547138,千尧,fancy apartment! located in a good position near china town and 15 walk to subway station. wholefoods locates in the same block.
apartment has everything you want,"clean and convenient.\"",,,,
7649517,69936057,2016-04-14,30557905,Gregory,"I really loved this place.  It was in a cool new building in South End.  It was walking distance to a lot of areas and there is a Whole Foods and coffee shop right down stairs.  It was clean, modern and had all the amenities you would be looking for from a high end hotel.  The concierges for the building are very nice and very helpful and the management company is super helpful and responsive.  They even let me check in early as my flight was early in the day."
7649517,77408533,2016-05-31,2612277,Leone,"This was my first Airbnb, and I was very pleased.  Clear, timely communication, picking up key was not a problem as the building has a concierge. The flat was just as shown, sweet spacious 1 bedroom. Comfy bed, bright, clean, lots of closet space. Nice building with 24 hour security."
The location is great,as a former Bostonian,it was easy for me to get around.  The South End has many cafes,bars,and great streets to walk. The location was above a Whole Foods - which was very convenient,as we did not have to eat out every night. There is also a gym downstairs ( both in the Ink building ) and at street level as well as a Peets coffee.
This neighborhood hosts a street fair on Sundays.,,,,,
The only thing that guests should be aware of is that there are no black out blinds,and in June the sun wakes you around 5:15 am.  BRIGHT,and there is new construction nearby,so you may hear the noise starting around 7:15 am.,,
"I would stay again for sure!\"",,,,,

7649517,97129817,2016-08-26,7714903,Lisa,We loved the location - and the easy access to the coffee shop and Whole Foods.
11590512,68448483,2016-04-05,28842090,Harish,"I really enjoyed my stay at this place. The location (walking distance outside of downtown and next to Whole Foods) was perfect. The space was as described and it really felt like being at home with a full kitchen, and washer/dryer. I definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the Boston area."
11590512,77644346,2016-06-02,49676966,Mirko,"Spacious, clean apartments with lots of light in Boston (Harrison Av); to call the location South End is a bit stretching it (truth is basically the intersection of Mass Pike and I-93) but the location is still very good (e.g. Whole Foods just around the corner) and convenient (10-15 minute walk to the Boston Common and a few blocks to the real South End). And well, the photos of the pool are a testament to what innovative photography can do (no need to brig  swim suit since if you really want to swim this is not a pool for you). Overall, much better than staying in some  boring Marriott or Westin."
"P.s. Try to get flat that has the view to Harrison Av (and not the parking lot and Highway on the other side)\"",,,,,
11590512,78229629,2016-06-05,73816353,Luis,"Clean, well-appointed modern apartment conveniently located next to Whole Foods"
11590512,83328679,2016-07-02,48966754,Michael,"I would certainly recommend this location to any business traveler looking for a completely stocked space with a washer/dryer, full kitchen, iron, bathing amenities, and a ginormous bathroom due to ADA compliance.  The apartment is super clean and the bed was extremely comfortable after long work days.  The location is situated between the  South End and Chinatown with one of the newest Whole Foods and several up and coming restaurant additions in Boston.  If you are heading to the Seaport or Fenway, an Uber ride will take you 6-15 minutes depending on the time of day.  It's as close to perfect as they come from check in to check out!"
11590512,93815227,2016-08-14,57211820,Bailey,excellent place. accurate to description. highly recommended.
9382898,61443580,2016-02-04,55154426,Mandeep Brar,"Well, talking about host- he was extremely rude, arrogant and never made us feel good in the property. And when I say that rest all things become Secondary."
Sharing just one of the Incidents that happened.,,,,,
We were suppose to reach there at about 11 AM as the Host had given us the permission for Early Check-in; and that was very kind of him.,,,,,
Apart from that nothing was good about the stay experience,as our flight got delayed and we got late so I called the host at 1 PM and told him that we will reach by 5-5.30 PM. Now after that unfortunately,we forgot the time and realised that we are late only after we received a call from the Host at 6.30 PM.,,,
The Host at first sounded genuine as he told us that he was waiting for us but then he said that if we are to stay in the Property we have to reach there by 7 PM as after that he will be leaving and he has Job to do.,,,,,
We realised our mistake and reached there by the given time and felt Sorry to the host a number of times but it was very late that we realised that he also stayed in the same property. So,now here are my points-,,,,
1. We only called him and told him about our arrival timings twice,but he never told us prior that he is particular about Check-in timings.He has not even mentioned that in his Rules.,,,,
2. He got our shoes removed outside; again that should be mentioned in the House Rules.,,,,,
3. 1 day before our Check-out time,he asked what time we will be leaving and I replied,"\"\"Around 11 AM\"\"; to which he said","\"\"It's fine and as long as you understand that\"\". This was even more ridiculous for him to say anything like that.",,
4. Lastly,even after a number of Sorry feelings he made us realise as we did some big crime.,,,,
Also the Room size is not that big as it appears in the pictures,even though there is just adequate storage space available with it.,,,,
"Neighbourhood is good without any issues with good it and close to Restaurants and Grocery stores.\"",,,,,
9382898,62223594,2016-02-12,48966769,Daniel,"I had a really nice stay, my bed was super confortable, the room was nice and clean. And the apartment was beautiful. The area is perfect."
My host was good and friendly.,,,,,
"I recommend this room ;)\"",,,,,
9382898,62820334,2016-02-17,33520312,May,"Andrew's place is fantastic, it is large and open, with a great view of the Boston skyline. It is very clean, and the kitchen is great for any cooking you want to do during your stay. My boyfriend and I felt very comfortable here, and almost every night we would cook dinner and then curl up on the couch and watch TV. It felt like home!"
Andrew is very nice and accommodating. We got along great with him,"which was just icing on top of the cake for this great listing. \"",,,,
9382898,63186680,2016-02-21,53524367,Sara,"Andrew was very helpful and polite, his house is very beautiful and with a fantastic view. the room was comfortable and everything was clean. Unfortunately, the metro is not very close but there is a shuttle service quite handy."
9382898,63974493,2016-02-28,59606409,MaryEllen,Andrew was a great host. He was welcoming and made sure we were comfortable. His apartment is beautiful! Spacious and with a great view. The apartment is a ten to fifteen minute walk to get to the t. I would definitely recommend staying here.
9382898,64778263,2016-03-08,38492891,Seoul,"This place was a great place to stay because it was right next to the T bus line that will take you straight to the Maverick blue line subway stop. Although we only got to meet Andrew on our last day, he was pleasant and the place was very clean and modern. Everything we needed was available and the view from the back balcony was great. It was a little cold at night, but that mght just be because the nest was trying to conserve energy and also the fact that we're from down (URL HIDDEN) we weren't used to Boston-level cold. Overall, the experience was great and I would definitely stay here again!"
9382898,64986882,2016-03-09,43774603,Helena,"Andrew was a very nice host with a spacious and clean apartment. Andrew provided fresh linens, water, and a couple of toiletries. Andrew was very polite and welcoming throughout our stay. Andrew allowed us to store some small snacks in his kitchen. Overall, this was a great stay and I would definitely recommend others to stay here."
9382898,65021305,2016-03-10,27596713,Rich,"Nice place near the airport. Great communication, good experience"
9382898,65369423,2016-03-13,21722129,Tim And Claire,Andrew was a super cool guy. We wish we could've spent more time with him!
We had a great time in Boston and the room was so close to public transport it really allowed us to explore. Restaurants nearby are fantastic,"the place is comfortable and spacious and we would love to stay again!\"",,,,
9382898,65545809,2016-03-15,19488280,Miriam,"Everything was perfectly fine - we could check-in and stay at the place even though Andrew wasn't there the two first days. In advance, Andrew gave us some useful tipps and after checking out we could store our luggage until our bus left Boston which was very kind!"
9382898,67541857,2016-03-30,16949619,Mark,"We didn't meet Andrew, but he went out of his way to accommodate us by arranging with his neighbor for us to be able to drop off our bags early at his place.  He wasn't home so we had his lovely apartment to ourselves.  The view is great.  There's a nice, authentic Mexican restaurant very nearby."
9382898,68839403,2016-04-07,6586827,Jessica & Dmitry,Andrew was welcoming and accommodating.  The room was clean and comfortable.  As a visitor to Boston who wanted quick access to the airport this was a great place to stay.
9382898,69006120,2016-04-08,30776922,Misaki,オシャレで綺麗で広くてベットも大きくふかふかで、とても居心地が良かったです。周りの街もカラフルで可愛いらしい。近くに大きいスーパーもあって、食料品や必需品は何でも揃います。後ろに川が広がっていて、ベランダからの景色も最高でした。4月の頭でも雪が降るくらい寒い所なので、湯船が付いているのはとてもありがたかった…!地下鉄の駅からは少し距離がありますが、家の近くまでのバスが長くても10分待てば来るので不自由は感じません。Andrewさんも返信が早くて、何も困ることはありませんでした。
"とてもおすすめです:)\"",,,,,

아침에 별다른 인사없이 10시가 체인 아웃타임이라고 알려주었습니다.,,,,,
"집은 깨끗하고 넓은편입니다. \"",,,,,
9382898,69304654,2016-04-10,64801352,Kevin,We enjoyed our stay in this nicely updated condo with a wonderful view.   It is very convenient to the airport and the subway.  We were able to use the kitchen and living room in addition to our bedroom and guest bathroom.   We only saw Andrew briefly and we appreciated how he respected our privacy.  The only minor issue was that he was unable to provide us with instructions on how to gain access to his space until the day before our visit.  He apologized for this and reported that he had recently been very busy at work.  An overall good stay!
9382898,69328603,2016-04-10,65364423,Jon,"This was my first time to Boston and the only negative I can find is the host. The advertisement is a lie as the only available area for you is the front bedroom. Communication was poor from the beginning as he did not respond to my message for more than a week till we were a hour outside of the city the day we came. The host was incredibly rude in the sense that he did not make us feel welcome, and continued to criminalize us. At one point he accused us of using his second bathroom, and in the morning was angry with me when my friend knocked on his door, a half an hour prior to check out to come get me. I apologized that my phone was dead, but this continued to make him be incredibly inconsiderate."
Pros:,,,,,
Cheap,,,,,
Nice neighborhood,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
Rude and unwelcoming host.,,,,,
All that is for rent is the small bedroom and the bathroom. Don't go to the living room and don't to go on the balcony.,,,,,
Provide your own towels and bath supplies. As the host will make you feel like you're overstepping you're single room boundary for using them. Or my personal favorite,try to take the provided bar of soap and put it in his bathroom to say you were in there.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9382898,70666736,2016-04-19,2260280,Christine,Andrew was understanding that we could not accurately predict our arrival time and made arrangements for us to access his apartment when we arrived no matter the time.
We found the apartment to be very pleasant.  A bottle of water was waiting for us when we entered the bedroom.  We also had access to the kitchen,living room,and deck overlooking the river,"although we did not have much time to be in the apartment and take advantage of it.  We found our host to be very nice to deal with.\"",,
9382898,72081439,2016-05-01,34859207,Declan,"We didn't meet Andrew but found the place to be as described. He was tricky to catch until shortly before we flew out to Boston, but once we got in touch all was well. There's a bit of a stroll to the T, but otherwise the location is good. Overall a lovely place to stay."
9382898,72610672,2016-05-03,55408525,Sandra,When we arrived Andrew was not at home but everything was prepared very well. Everything was arranged in order to enter the house. The room was clean and we had our own bath room and we were allowed to use the flat in that way as if it was our home. That was very kind and everything was very comfortable. We only met Andrew during the evening on the second day but we were happy that this worked out. Thanks for trusting us and hosting us in that great way.
9382898,72777597,2016-05-04,24640164,Lisa,"This was the perfect location for our stay. We only had one night in town before catching a flight out and we were looking for a clean and welcoming room. A nice perk was that it was a quick bus ride (insanely convenient that it picks up right outside the door!) to the blue T train. Very close to the airport as well (5 min cab ride). Our travel times were in flux and we arrived late and left early, so unfortunately we did not get to meet Andrew. But he left clear instructions on how to access his home, and had everything set up for us. The bathroom is huge and super clean, and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  If you are looking for an affordable and spacious room outside of the downtown area, but still incredibly accessible to everything the city has, then this listing is spot on."
9382898,73002478,2016-05-06,4402991,Eleonora,Andrew's place is clean and comfortable. We had a good experience staying at his house
9382898,73939770,2016-05-11,45780157,Uendel,I had such a great experience staying at Andrew's house that I want to share a little bit of it:
1. He is a really cool guy,,,,,
2. The apartment is very beautiful,welcoming,clean and cozy,,,
3. It is literally across the street from a bus stop that take you to the subway station in 7-10 minutes tops,which can take you to the main attractions in Boston.,,,,
4. The bedroom is very spacious,the bed is REALLY comfy.,,,,
5. The bathroom is very comfortable and super clean.,,,,,
6. He has an incredible porch with an amazing view.,,,,,
7. Privacy is a plus here. He made us feel like home at all times.,,,,,
8. Don't ever go back to his place hungry because the food he cooks smells AWESOME and it would make you even more hungry.,,,,,
"I strongly recommend this place\"",,,,,
9382898,74959617,2016-05-17,18905777,Shirley,"Andrew communicated well with us and made arrangements so that we had access to the house if he was not home;  Very comfortable bed and beautiful home with peaceful view.  Nice to have separate bathroom.   I wish we were able to stay longer.   Parking was available even with the recent residential permit restrictions.  If you have a car, it is best to arrive earlier in the day/evening per Andrew, but we found a spot when we arrived after 10:00 pm;   Easy access to public transportation which we usually use, except this time we needed a car to move our daughter home.  Thank you for allowing us to share your home for this short time!"
9382898,76109605,2016-05-24,29334580,Jon,"Andrew's apartment is in a great location for visiting Boston. It's minutes from the downtown area and also close to the freeways that lead to the suburban areas. The apartment is neat and clean and the room was nicely furnished. Andrew was a gracious host. Given hotel prices in the Boston area, this is also a great value."
9382898,76200209,2016-05-25,68164130,Laurie,"Convenient to airport. Price reasonable for clean, barebones room. Private bath. Bring your own incidentals as only towels provided. Saw Andrew for maybe 5 minutes so had privacy in nice, clean apartment and use of lovely porch on beautiful day."

9382898,78538216,2016-06-07,65779740,Randy,Andrew was very welcoming and informative on how we could get around and places to go to and eat. His condo is very clean and comfortable as well as the bed. Having your own bathroom is a plus!
9382898,78739172,2016-06-08,5714537,Sithichok,Good harbour view from the patio and close to Logan airport. It would be great for a short stay in Boston. And he have a comefort bed.
9382898,80192862,2016-06-16,62779303,Jeremy,So the house is really nice! Back porch gives you an amazing view of downtown. He let us know ahead of time that he didn't know if he was going to be home when we got there so he gave us instructions on where the keys would be and very clear instructions on which apartment was his and which room we were staying in. So overall very good experience! Definitely recommend him to family and friends!!

andrew was always in reach and offered to help with anything.,,,,,
the room is exactly as described. its clean. bed is very comfortable. had my own bathroom. can get a little noisy from the street. also i could use the rest of the apartment,including kitchen,living room and the balcony with a nice view.,,,

9382898,81474107,2016-06-23,49029289,Raul,"Andrew's place was an upper story room in a big old building overlooking the waterfront. The view from the porch is fantastic! The room was clean, with a comfortable bed and use of a private bathroom. We actually never saw Andrew, because he came in late and we left very early, but he gave us clear directions on how to access the place, and great recommendations on where to eat in this diverse East Boston neighborhood. Getting an Uber to the airport was a breeze, even at 4:00 am. We had a great stay,"

Communication with Andrew was very efficient. The appartment has a good location just outside the city centre and a beautiful view upon the city.
9382898,83137099,2016-07-01,18200344,Julia,"The room was ok and very clean, but really small for three people. The AC worked automatically and was very loud during the night. There also was a lot of traffic outside. We only stayed for one night before going to the airport, so it was ok for the price."
Andrew is hard to get in touch with. We only got instructions on how to get the keys 30 mins before our estimated arrival. After that,"everything was fine. We never saw Andrew and he never answered my message asking about the check-out.\"",,,,
9382898,84934510,2016-07-09,72131286,Jeremy,"All went good and smoothly. We stayed two nights there. The flat is not so far from airport and easy to find. The area is populated mostly by latin people. The subway is 15 min walk from the flat. Then we reached and visited Boston. The guest room and the shower was ready, clean when we arrived. The guest room is simple but it was as expected. Balcony has a very nice view, refreshing on evening. Andrew was not there at the time of arrival but Andrew sent me a mail how to reach and enter the flat."
9382898,86806130,2016-07-17,43104628,Fabio,"El piso está muy bien. Aunque Andrew tardó un poco en responder mientras íbamos de viaje, pero nos explico que estaba ocupado en su trabajo y se disculpó, eso es bastante amable de su parte. El sitio estaba a 20 min del metro, hay un montón de restaurantes en la zona y cerca hay un Marshals cerca donde se puede comprar ropa a buen precio. En el piso hay dos baños, lo que significa que uno es para los huéspedes. Durante nuestra estadía Andrew tenía una boda así que al final estuvimos todo el fin de semana solos. Lo recomendamos para conocer Boston!!!!"
9382898,87568431,2016-07-20,54652438,Andrew,Andrew was very hospitable and accommodating. The room/place was clean and was in a perfect location for hopping on public transit and heading to any place in the city. Would highly reccommend!
9382898,88808730,2016-07-25,13996456,Beth,"We had a great stay at Andrew's apartment. We did not get to meet Andrew, as he was away for the weekend, but communication was perfect on arrival and departure regarding the keys, etc. The location is great, there's a bus stop right outside the door which will take you to the subway station, where you can be right downtown in 1 or 2 stops. It's also close to the airport, which made getting to our morning flight really easy. The bathroom and bedroom were spacious. The noise on the street was a little loud on Friday/Saturday night as the bedroom is at the front, but apart from that we had a great stay!"
9382898,89701063,2016-07-29,24929913,Malena,"Andrews Zimmer hat uns gut gefallen und hat perfekt zu dem gepasst, was wir vor hatten. Sehr nah zum Flughafen, sodass wir zu Fuß zu Andrew gegangen sind und eine super Anbindung nach Downtown."
Das Zimmer war einfach,aber völlig ausreichend,wenn man nur zum Schlafen dort ist und entspricht exakt den Bildern und der Beschreibung. Das eigene Bad war ebenfalls sehr angenehm. Außerdem ist die Wohnung sowie das Zimmer klimatisiert.,,,
Kurz vor unserem Abflug kam von Andrew eine genaue Beschreibung,wie wir an den Schlüssel kommen und was wir sonst noch wissen mussten.,,,,

La chambre est spacieuse et nous disposions d'une salle de bain privée! Belle surprise!! L'appartement dans son ensemble est tres beau et la vue sur le port le rend encore plus charmant. Nous n'avons pas utilise la cuisine mais par choix! Mais Andrew nous a fait sentir chez nous en nous autorisant à utiliser tout ce dont nous avions besoin. Nous avons peu rencontre Andrew car il était souvent absent. Le logement est dans le quartier hispanique, si vous aimez manger mexicain et autres, foncez!"
9382898,91918085,2016-08-07,7801033,Julian,"Ziemlich nah am Flughafen, also super für Leute die nur eine Nacht überbrücken wollen. Taxi hat ca 10-12 Dollar gekostet, uber auch."

Even though he had a personal guest over, he let me watch the Olympics on his TV. Overall had a great experience and would stay with him again in the future."
9382898,93406271,2016-08-12,41836487,Stuart,"It's a very nice apartment, very clean and in a good area. Although I didn't see Andrew much when I was there as I was out most of the time he seemed like a nice guy. Overall I enjoyed staying here and would recommend it."

732932,2787682,2012-11-02,3739308,Charles,Alishya Mayfield was an exceptional host. She is a very interesting and worldly person and I would definitely highly recommend her living quarters for future airbnb guests. Her apartment was exceptionally clean and meet all of our expectations. I would definitely stay at her place again as it made our stay in Boston more lively and enjoyable. Thank you Alishya also for the metro card to get our public transit kick started!
732932,2847574,2012-11-09,2812028,Ethan,"My stay with Alishya was most wonderful in every way. She is quite amicable, pleasant and very accommodating. The apartment was clean, tastefully decorated and super comfortable. The apartment is on a bus line, a couple blocks from the orange T and is in a very walkable neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants close by. Alishya supplied maps of Boston and, luckily me, a charlie card! When I come to visit Boston again, I will without a doubt, want to stay here again!"
732932,3373704,2013-01-19,4633420,Maria,"Alishya's apartment was the best place for me to start my life in Boston. When I entered the house I had 2 lovely cats waiting for me, a wonderful living room with a great bookshelf, a clean, organized, large bedroom. I felt home! And what you see here is what you get or even more. Location, light, space, you get it all! I also had a lovely roommate! Sadly I didn't get to meet Alishya because she was abroad but I hope we get to meet eventually so I can thank her in person for the most confortable and amazing stay in Jamaica Plain and also for her kindness and care. After living in this sunny home was very difficult for me to find a permanent apartment for my own because they didn't look so good as Alyshia's!"
"\"",,,,,
732932,4073896,2013-04-08,4615093,Tiago,"It was a pleasure staying in Alishya's house. I felt at home. The apartment is cozy, well decorated and organized with a large bedroom. It is also well located - a neighborhood with shops, cafes and restaurants and near Forest Hill Station. I stayed for one month and had a nice housemate. The cats are lovely. I didn't meet Alishya in person because she was abroad, but she always sent me emails asking if everything was okay. To sum up - I highly recommend Alishya's house to anyone needing a nice place to stay in Boston."
732932,5295853,2013-06-23,6408610,Beata,I had a wonderful stay in Alishya's place . She was very friendly and helpful host. Flat is very nice and clean. Very good location for visiting Boston.The subway is not so far and bus is next to the house. The  neighborhood is very interesting with nice places to walk or run...I would definitely rent from her again!
732932,5404424,2013-06-28,3579623,Lucas,"Staying at Alishya's was totally pleasant and handy. Alishya was helpful in getting us oriented in Boston and was generous with her time answering the many questions we had. She is great to talk to and also respects the privacy of her guests. The room, like the condo as a whole, is perfectly cozy and includes wardrobe space for some clothes. Her cats are also friendly characters; they chilled with us on the deck a bunch of times. Aside from that, the pad is close to the subway, a decent food co-op, and JP is fun to explore (great parks!). We were very satisfied with our stay and would recommend Alishya's place to anybody."
732932,10191265,2014-02-05,7010884,Ignacio,Alishya is a great host. Very helpful with indications and she always makes sure that you have everything you need.
The house is exactly as shown in the pictures. I loved the neighborhood (Jamaica Plain),with a lot of shops and good restaurants. The T (metro,orange line) is only 5 minutes walking away,and it takes you anywhere in Boston,so really convenient.,
Everything is clean and there is no problem at all with sharing the bathroom with her (she usually leaves pretty early in the morning).,,,,,
And the cats are very sweet!,,,,,
"Thanks for having us Alishya!\"",,,,,
732932,11239213,2014-03-26,4031091,Samantha,My husband and I stayed with Alishya for 5 weeks while I was doing some work in Boston.  She was a fantastic host and her apartment is first rate.  The kitties are characters as well and it was so wonderful to come 'home' at the end of the day to such a charming place!  I would definitely stay with Alishya again!
732932,16761731,2014-08-02,6862166,Simon,"Having stayed with Alishya during a couple of days last year, we now stayed for about a month. In short, this room is as described on the profile in a nice home of a likeable host. We particularly liked the balcony which is large and close to the kitchen. Alishya herself is quite busy but is in every way helpful and accomodating. The area is safe, cats are charming, public transport just on the street, neighbors are nice, supermarket a few blocks away."

Not only was Alishya a delight and wonderful hostess, but she was very helpful and provided advice on places to eat and go. Between the beautiful home environment, the luxe towels, and comfy bed, I felt as if I were staying in a boutique hotel and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to stay in the Boston area."

The garden in the backyard was beautiful and very relaxing. Her place was great as it was minutes away from the subway that led right to the middle of the city. Also the neighbourhood was great with cute restaurants and cafes."
732932,44784821,2015-08-29,35908605,Suzanne,"Alishya was very responsive in advance of my visit, describing her condo and room precisely.  The unit was professionally cleaned in advance of my visit and there was a bottle of Moscoto d'Asti waiting for me.  The wi-fi name and password were prominent.  Alishya was out of state so her roommate kindly showed me the unit.  The kitchen was accessible, and tea and coffee were available.  There is a beautiful back deck and on the ground floor there are two seating areas that I availed myself of.  The house was nicely decorated and the bed was comfortable. Apple TV with Netflix etc was available but not cable.  It was plenty for me.  Jamaica Plain is a fun, lively place with plenty of shops, restaurants and bars.  I took the bus to Whole Foods market without difficulty and the orange line MBTA is nearby.    I felt quite safe all the time."
732932,49937277,2015-10-07,26592,Vikas,Alishya is an incredibly kind and thoughtful host. The care she shows even from afar is truly extraordinary.

Joanne made me feel like it was my house for the month I stayed because I could browse through her collection of cookbooks,she let me do my laundry,my car was parked in a safe neighborhood,and I never had to wait for the shower in the morning.  She always had my cereal bowl and place setting waiting for me(except for that rainy Tue. morning; just kidding ; ),,
Joanne is quick with the wit and thoughtful,"especially with her home design and decor.  I will definitely borrow some of her details in my home.\"",,,,

Joanne is amazing and her dog,Ms. Rita,is the most precious and fabulous pug ever! I stayed with her for about 3 nights while looking for accommodation in Boston. She is so caring that she even helped in my search for housing -  I mean she made phone calls,kept an eye out for listings,asked her neighbors,the whole nine! Joanne went above and beyond for me
From the minute I walked in (hours later than my anticipated arrival),Joanne made me feel right at home.,,,,
Joanne's home is absolutely beautiful and the room was just perfect! She spoiled me. Every morning she treated me to the best cup of coffee with steamed milk (foam included). She had all of these wonderful machines to suit any coffee or tea drinker's needs! And the breakfast? My goodness,"I wish I could upload the Instagram worthy pictures of the beautiful breakfast Joanne made. One of my friends described it as \"\"world-class\"\".",,,,
The neighborhood was quiet,quaint and safe. Residential. The kind of neighborhood where everyone knows everyone and shares recipes,meals,and fresh vegetables from their garden! Parking is very easy. It was on street.,,
Words can't describe how grateful I am that Joanne shared her beautiful space with me. I did not want to leave. If you've got a chance to stay here,"you must! You'd be doing yourself a disservice is you don't. \"",,,,

She had perfect recommendations for things to do and places to eat nearby. The apartment itself was better than the listing had described. The rooftop views are awesome and a great way to end each evening. There is super easy access to the metro (or subway? I don't know what they call it in Boston) and to the train. The neighborhood is quiet and very pleasant. Also, it's a short walk to Fenway which makes going to a game really easy (highly recommended). We loved everything about this place and if/when we visit Boston again, this would be the first listing i would look to see availability."

She met us upon arrival (we were delayed multiple times), gave a walk through of the apartment and key info/minor rules, then handed us the keys. The apartment is in a fantastic location in the South End of Boston. Traveling via the subway, we were about 20 minutes away from almost all tourist attractions except Harpoon brewery and Castle Island which are both at the city's Waterfront area. To get there, we rented bikes using the city's Hubway program. For just a few dollars we site-to-site biked all day. There were several hubs very close to the apartment and near all of our desired Boston destinations. The apartment also had dozens of excellent restaurants and bars within just a couple of minutes walking distance which was excellent when grabbing dinner or a drink after a long day of site seeing."
My only recommendation is they provide a hair dryer. We thought there would be one but we didn't see it and didn't take the time to stop and ask.,,,,,

It is super convenient to The Back Bay train station and Star Market shopping for groceries, as well as restaurants on Tremont. Communication with Erin was great, and she was flexible with my later arrival time. A few notes:  2nd floor walk up with no elevator, no in unit or building washer/dryer, hair dryer and umbrellas available for guest use (and much appreciated). Definitely a Wish List keeper!"

However, the problem with my stay was that they double booked me the first night of my 3 night stay. I unknowingly walked in on two people staying there, could not reach the host, and had to find other accommodations late at night.  The wifi was also not working and the repair man came many hours after he was supposed to. Overall, it was unfortunately pretty far from ideal for me."

Despite some administrative problems at our end, which caused the booking process to take much longer as needed, Mike was cooperating and patient. After first having booked a place near Fenway, he was furthermore able to move us to a place at Kendal (previously not available) upon our request. The place was great, everything as advertised and check-in/out went fine. Would definitely go there again!"

She was super kind and left us little things to make our stay more comfortable, like bagels and orange juice. She was hospitable and gave us information on the area. Lovely host!"
Our apartment had 2 bedrooms and great accommodations for a group of 4. The little touches like coffee and tea,mouthwash,and even bagels and orange juice was wonderful. The home,while a little walk to the train,was super close to delicious restaurants and bars. We felt very safe. The apartment feels recently renovated and has awesome amenities and a clean,modern feel.
Only thing to note is that this is indeed a lower level apartment and if you're a light sleeper,"noise from upstairs neighbors may bother you in the morning. We had no issues whatsoever though.\"",,,,

We were supplied with all the necessities more than what hotels do, we even got bagels with cream cheese to go with it, the kids were impressed. We felt safe because Miriam just live on the 3rd floor, as for the parking it was very congested but what do you expect from Boston, it's like little New York. We will definitely stay there again if we decide to stay overnight. Thank you Miriam for bearing with us and the kids especially with our little Snickers, really appreciate it."

Mirium's place was the perfect setting. We had everything we needed. It was very clean and contemporary. Decorated with a very warm and cosy family atmosphere. A variety store being a 1 minute walk away was very convenient. The 9 minute walk to the train was refreshing. When I got a car on the third day, off street parking was available. We had a great time."

Neighborhood lacked curb appeal.  Corner store was very convenient and store owner was welcoming.   Air conditioning was through window units.  Everything worked.  Beautiful television with cable.  Wi-fi was available for computers and iphones.

His fiancé gave us some great advice on where to eat in Boston. Their place is spacious and clean. The subway station is only a few steps away, making their apartment a great place to discover the beautiful city of Boston. I would definitely recommend this place to friends."

We didn't get a chance to interact because we were out exploring most of the time but they were both super responsive via text and email and flexible with our check in and check out times due to flight times. Great neighborhood with easy access to bus stops and the train. Highly recommend.
10656899,88815355,2016-07-25,11519096,Nico,Sina and his wife are nice hosts intrested in the guests. Their apartment is equipped with more than all the neccessary things - but no toilet paper... Grocery sotres are close. The next public transportation is sunny and green and on top reachable by feet. Advise: ask early for arrival information. For us as a couple staying 3 nights in this apartment was allright. We like to stay the next time again with sina and his wife.
3917027,18592392,2014-08-28,20272949,Victor,This was a really nice place to stay for my first week in Boston! The room was large and tidy just as the whole apartment. Quinn answered all my questions within minutes! Also the location is very good. It's just steps away from blue line and I've always felt completely safe. I recommend this room to everybody who wants to stay in Boston for a couple of days!
3917027,19239230,2014-09-08,19756676,Wesley,"As my first Airbnb stay, the experience was great. The directions I was given before my stay were prefect and really were the base for me getting around the rest of the trip (the only thing I'd add is that once you leave the orient heights trains stop, you've walked too far if you've gotten to CVS) Speaking of which, CVS is a block up the street which was really convenient. I would absolutely stay here again."
3917027,19337024,2014-09-10,19593921,Juan,The house was easy to locate and close to the subway. The room was clean and large. The check-in process was easy and convenient and the host provided enough information and help to make the process easier.

Quinn runs the place like a hotel and everything worked out very well. The place is very close to the metro (3mins walk), the only downside is that the blue line is practically useless since the government Sqr. Station is closed until 2016 and I usually had to take 3 trains to get downtown."

Location of the house is not that bad -very close to subway station. One thing is; it's expensive for a guest house room with shared bathroom and kitchen. If this price strategy continues, I think we will look for another place to stay in Boston."

I had no trouble with the shard bathroom, kitchen, and everything in the huge house. Moreover, I loved the fact that May allowed us to store our luggage in the common area after we checked out on the last day, since our flight was in the evening. Even thought I didn't get to see May in person, she was such a nice host for accommodating our needs. I will definitely come back again!"

Pro: great location convenient to the T (transit); a nice beach and good restaurants nearby; room was very clean, comfortable, with AC, and just as advertised; small shared front deck and a larger deck out back.  Con: the kitchen is shared by many guests and it was very dirty when we were there, dishes and dirty pots and pans, old food in the cupboards, trash overflowing.  Never saw the host, and when I made a request by both text and email, it was ignored.  Also, it's on a very busy street with traffic noise all night, so if you are sensitive to noise, this is not the place for you, or at least avoid the street-facing rooms."

Die Lage ist gut, zur U-bahn ist es wie beschrieben sehr nah, die Stadtmitte kann in 15 Minuten erreicht werden. Allerdings liegt das Zimmer an einer recht lauten Straße.

There are three washrooms on 2nd floor, so no need to worry about fighting with others for it. The kitchen was fully equipped, so you could make breakfast on your own.  The house location is convenient - about 3 min walk to the Orient Height station (blue line), and 5 min walk to two small supermarkets. Overall we are satisfied with the experience."
3917027,50239642,2015-10-10,43979093,Wei,"Very near to subway blue line ,3 mins by walk,very easy to check in even by our shelf.room is very clean,and bed is comfortable.just we just stay only one night because they don't have available room when we want to love one mor night."
Little things is that,we didn't see the host and we can not talk face to face for something.,,,,

3917027,51095545,2015-10-17,455331,Susan,The room was as pictured on Airbnb but there was also a comfortable chair and a refrigerator freezer in my room. The bed was very comfortable and there was lots of space to hang and store clothing. I appreciated that the house was only two blocks from the Orient Heights metro and that I was able to get a room with one days notice because my arrangements fell through at the last minute.
"There were two bathrooms and one shower which were shared with five rooms of people which made it occasionally challenging to take a shower. I only received one towel to shower with and I couldn't locate anyone on premises to get another one.  The bedding and the refrigerator was spotless but there were hordes of dust balls all over the floor which aggravated my allergies.  It's a tossup if I would stay there again even though it was only $70 a night.\"",,,,,
3917027,51969623,2015-10-25,46170338,Spencer,"The listing was accurate, a nice room close to the train; it was perfect for my stay."
3917027,52730927,2015-11-01,42380486,Hailey,Staying with Quinn-May was awesome. I never met them but they made sure our stay was comfortable. The room was quite large with plenty of space for 3 of us. It was very clean and right next to a metro stop. I would definitely stay there again!
3917027,68494638,2016-04-05,62664149,Gemma,"Had a lovely stay at this airbnb.  We did self check in and check out which was useful as we could arrive late after our late flight was delayed even later than planned without having to worry about missing the check in time.  Excellent location, easy to get into downtown on the subway or to the airport - the subway station was literally 2 minutes away if that so even close than she described!  Room was spacious with a double bed and a single bed, a dresser, table, wardrobe and fridge/freezer so perfect for what we needed.  Also had access to the shared kitchen, bathroom, shower room and toilet room - we never had to queue to use these.  Facilities were basic but all that we needed given we were out most of the time exploring Boston anyway!  Good price given Boston is a very expensive city!  Excellent stay overall and would recommend to anyone!"
3917027,70697311,2016-04-19,28704451,Justine,This house was AMAZING!! It was so conveniently located-i was there for 2 days to run the Boston Marathon and had no trouble getting around. The host replied to my messages so quickly and i appreciate their hospitality.
3917027,72175920,2016-05-01,2562887,Dietmar,"The neighborhood is ok, really convenient since there is direct access to the subway system."
Be aware that this is basically a hotel. Restrooms,kitchen and showers are shared and quite dirty,but since the location is so convenient that might not be a showstopper. Also the beds are really unstable.,,,
"\"",,,,,
3917027,74647834,2016-05-16,65817890,Jessica,"The location was great,it's 10 min to the T-train and 10 more min to the center of the city."
That's the only good thing I can say! Unfortunately the whole house is totally dirty,almost to dirty to live inside! The bathtub is not usable because it's so dirty and the shower is ok.. But still outside the shower is everything covered with dust and hairs. I'm sry to say that but the whole house is disgusting!!,,,,
We planned to cook while we stay there but after we saw the kitchen we decided to go out to eat..,,,,,
"I'm very disappointed!\"",,,,,
3917027,75635461,2016-05-22,72360218,Cynthia,"The neighborhood was beautiful and quiet. The room was spacious, but lacked a television which my friend can't live without. The big screen tv in the kitchen area has limited channels. We did not meet our hosts at all during the 2 nights we were there. The bathroom (toilet and shower are separate rooms) were clean. The area was only a few minutes away from my family."

3917027,84461939,2016-07-07,77578058,Luíza,"Unfortunately our stay wasn't as good as we expected, mainly because the building, in general, wasn't clean. I'm not that person who is addicted to cleanliness, but in this case the place was truly dirty. You know when we clean only superficially... and under the bed, behind the furniture, the windows, they are all dirty? It happens with me sometimes in my room, but it's my place... (:P) When the place is to receive guests it must be very clean, all clean!"
The kitchen was completely dirty... the cooker was covered by food scraps... The common area was very unclean,with dust everywhere... and a lot of cigarette butts... Our room and the bathroom were,as I said,only slightly clean.,,
Other thing that bothered us a bit was that we arrived at 4pm,the time when the check-in started,but there was no one to receive us... The person who knew where the keys of our room were arrived only 1 hour later.,,,
On the other hand,the location was good,near the subway station.,,,
And the fridge inside the room really helped us,since using the kitchen wasn't a viable option.,,,,

The room was spacious and clean, thankfully their was aircon and everything was fine. The house is a Little noisy so you can hear other guests talking etc but nothing too much.

3917027,87532372,2016-07-20,75914610,Martin,"Never got to meet the host but the room was available upon our request for early arrival (2pm). Room was decent, however there was no TV available. This room was within the 2nd floor which had 4 other rooms other than this one, with 2 bathrooms. Value was good, and it was a plus to be really close to the Blue Line. In the neighborhood there were some small chain restaurants (i.e. Dunkin Donuts, Burger King), overall this house was in a nice neighborhood which is close to the beach overseeing Logan airport."
3917027,87692112,2016-07-21,53818441,Alicia,"Very close to train station, easy access, area felt safe, though. We did not see the hosts, they responded quickly and were very helpful."

Was a complete life saver,was about to be forced to sleep on a chair in the airport without their quick response.,,,,
-NOTE-,,,,,
Take the subway!! Taxi was a complete rip off ($25!!),there's a free bus to the subway,and the subway is $2.75,3 stations to the house and it's literally 1 minute walk from the subway station.,,

Kitchen, bathrooms etc are shared between all the occupants of the five bedrooms. For that, the price is a little bit too expansive."
1510876,6796461,2013-08-25,1418694,Dinh,"What can I say? This is my FAMILY!!!! Bruce and Barry are the best hosts that you can EVER encounter in your life. They are soooooo welcoming and generous. On my arrival day, they drove me back to the house. They also drove me to the bus station on departure day which helped me a lot because I had tons of luggages. This is the ONLY PLACE where I will stay the next TIMES I visit Boston. This house is GORGEOUS! If you have stayed in one of those luxury hotels such as Hilton, Caesars, or Marriot, the living condition is THE SAME or EVEN BETTER in this house. Yet, it is better because of the GREAT hospitality that Bruce and Barry offer. There are two dogs: Gorgio and Jasmine. You will meet other fellows visitors since they have 4-5 rooms available for rentals. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND anyone to stay here. The neighborhood is on the safe side of Dorchester. Once again, the hosts are great. They offer you to dine with them for $10, and Bruce is a PHENOMENAL cook. There are many things that I can tell you guys, but you should experience the place yourself!!!!"
1510876,6929379,2013-08-30,16952,Ronan,I unfortunately didn't had a chance to meet Bruce but Christian welcomed me. He was very friendly and show me all what I need. I only came for a night but it was a really good experience!
The house is gorgeous,with a very nice decoration and the bedroom is really confortable with a TV.,,,,
I met other hosts in the corridor that arrived early morning and they told me that Bruce offered them a wonderful breakfast. I didn't enjoyed it because I don't eat on the morning (even fresh fruits as we had!) but I enjoyed the juices.,,,,,
Helen,another guest was in the kitchen when I left around 7:30am and she looked like to enjoyed the breakfast :-),,,,
Bruce gave me all the informationI need. The perfect host !,,,,,

Bruce also drove me to a near consumer electronics retailer to buy a SIM card for my mobile phone. He even later drove me to the T station when I wanted to go to the city.

3363097,49262837,2015-10-02,36049408,Scott,John's place is always awesome. Attention to small details makes this the most pleasant of stays in the area. He even met me at the airport with the key...
3363097,49999287,2015-10-08,21382299,Todd,John was extremely responsive and the accommodations and location were perfect. Great stay.
3363097,53883751,2015-11-14,9124689,Rachi,John's apartment is fantastic.  We couldn't have found a better place to stay to attend a conference at the convention center.  We just walked across the bridge and we were there.
Checking in was easy.  I made contact from Logan airport and someone was waiting at the front door with keys and instructions.,,,,,
The apartment was clean,"fresh everything.  lots of light fantastic views.  One of the nicest places we have stayed using airbnb.\"",,,,
3363097,65057889,2016-03-10,16457792,Hoyt,"Great space and location. Just as appears in the photos. Super convenient for attending expos etc at the Convention Center. I prefer over staying right there at the Westin because you can get out of the fray, find good, reasonably priced restaurants and breakfast, and you are a 5 min walk away. Oh and have to mention the incredible view from every room and great porch you can enjoy the view from."
Also,"John was incredibly attentive - He means it when he says he'll be your virtual concierge!\"",,,,
3363097,66052225,2016-03-19,9442878,Rich,"Overall great experience, the apartment building was superb, apartment was clean and bed was comfy. Great location, amazing views, and John was very accommodating (and patient) when my meeting ran a bit late and I held him up."

3363097,70746418,2016-04-20,6309105,Cameron,"Great place and great location.  Just as depicted in photos.  This is a dog friendly complex which delighted my GF to no end.  We got to see new dogs every day.  Staff is friendly and check in and out is easy.  The location is very convenient to lots of really good restaurants and fun bars (like Lucky's Tavern).  Easy walk to the city and less than a mile from Boston Commons.  I would recommend this place to anyone, especially if you are there for the Marathon.  You can get an Uber ride to pretty much everywhere for under $10 w/o the surge.  Airport was under $20. I didn't have much interaction with John but really didn't need it.  Beds are very comfortable.  on par with high end hotels.  Two nice bathrooms.  and plenty of living room space.  Quiet building.  Even with all the dogs we rarely heard anyone else."
3363097,71521762,2016-04-25,39153796,Elena,"Great place to stay in Boston, and very convenient to the convention center! Apartment was beautiful, comfortable and the neighborhood has lots of walkable restaurants and entertainment. We hated to leave!"
3363097,77760828,2016-06-03,14900748,Mona,"John was very thorough and ready to help with regards to finding the apt, ensuring that we were comfortable and our departure. Unfortunately we were there for work and didn't have much time to explore Boston but John was well prepared to assist with local restaurants and things to do. The apt was very clean and had the amenities to make the stay very comfortable."
3363097,79215066,2016-06-11,10220865,Luigi,"We had a very nice stay at John's apartment. We were in Boston for a conference at the Boston Convention Centre and the house is located just 5 minutes walk from it. It was a perfect spot for us. The area is very nice, with a lot of restaurants in a few minutes walking. The condo is newly renovated and very nice. The apartment was just as in the pictures. Very comfortable and clean. John was a fantastic host. Very communicative, responsive and helpful in helping with all our needs."
"I definitely recommend his apartment and him as a host.\"",,,,,
3363097,81383058,2016-06-22,62781655,Jorge,muy bien es muy amable estuvo pendiente todo el tiempo y muy organizado todas sus instrucciones  volveria otra vez
3363097,82498144,2016-06-27,32868040,Chase,John was very accommodating and he left very detailed instructions for getting checked in and out. The process was seamless.

3363097,83399489,2016-07-02,3851628,Wes,"Wonderful location if you are attending something at the convention centre. 10 min walk door to door. The apartment is clean and very well put together. John, the owner, is very nice and accommodating. Great restaurants in the area, many that John recommended upon our arrival. Couldn't have asked for a better experience overall."
3363097,86316804,2016-07-16,67666610,Kelly Milukas,John was personable and available at anytime you needed for questions and information on the area. He makes his guests feel very welcome and comfortable. I would stay there again anytime and by the way the location and the view  looking over Boston is spectacular .
3363097,90514658,2016-08-01,45188826,Petra,Communicatie is goed en uitgebreid. Locatie en appartement meer geschikt voor zakelijk gebruik dan prive vakantie. Uitzicht rondom parkeerplaatsen. Appartement is sober ingericht veel spullen van eigenaar aanwezig. Voorzieningen zoals borden en glazen en handdoeken beperkt.
3363097,92775608,2016-08-10,13228404,Benjamin,Fantastic place. Super comfortable. Very close to great food and convention center. Great value. Modern.
3363097,93468752,2016-08-12,32492965,Greg,"John was very accommodating leading up to our stay and would answer our questions in a very timely manner. Once we arrived John again offered his help if required fortunately all went well. Apartment is modern, beds are comfortable and all mod cons are provided. Location is excellent only 10 minute walk to T Subway. Plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance and close to the harbour as well. I would recommend apartment for up to 4 guests as it has 2 separate bedrooms."
3363097,97435197,2016-08-27,45521315,Pachota,"Very clean, best location for Boston convention, well decorated and very nice host. We gave 10/10! And surely return when we will be back to Boston."
11306586,65918575,2016-03-18,33609462,Kathy,Very cozy studio apartment in a wonderful quiet neighborhood.  Located at the beginning of the Freedom Trail and only a couple of blocks to the T.  The location is perfect for a short stay!!  Boston Commons is one short block away and lots of restaurants!
11306586,66252078,2016-03-20,1845454,Olga,"\"It's important to note that the apartment is \"\"Garden level\"\" and the windows have shades which cannot be opened.  As a result"
11306586,67651925,2016-03-30,58700669,Heather,"Felt very welcomed when greeted by Eddie, with the keys, upon arrival.  This quiet studio apt is in an awesome, central location with a private entrance. The quaint studio was clean and fully stocked with everything you need. Very comfortable bed! Only thing to note was listed in the previous review about the apt being at garden-level.  It's the perfect place for a short stay :)"
11306586,68156120,2016-04-02,48723372,Aaron,Everything was clean and well put together. Awesome location and the host was very helpful!
11306586,68809783,2016-04-06,12011214,Sarah,"Eddie was very gracious even though I arrived late at night because of a flight delay. The apartment was clean, comfortable and well-located. I would stay here again."

11306586,70637096,2016-04-19,62025569,Kathy,Alan and Eddie were very responsive and the apartment was clean and pleasant. I would definitely use them again.
11306586,71119661,2016-04-23,51424883,Rob,Everything was FANTASTIC!!!  I want to stay there every time I'm in Boston.  A great property in a convenient location.
11306586,73914243,2016-05-11,25892201,Sara,"Alan and Eddie were great hosts. We had a nice stay in beacon hill. Close to restaurants, shopping, subway, historical sites etc. The cozy studio was perfect location for all of that. We had an awesome time! Thank you again!!"
11306586,74795045,2016-05-16,2585334,Judith,"We had the most marvelous time in Boston. A wonderful city. The studio is in a perfect location, so readily assessable to everything! The magnificent gardens Boston Common only two minutes walk, shops, very central. Eddie was so helpful and gave us loads of information about the area. Don't let the entrance to the apartment put you off! The place was very clean, lovely towels, shower was great, shampoo conditioner etc, excellent Internet, bed was very comfortable. We found the apartment quiet and even though the windows are covered for privacy, didn't feel dark. We stayed 5 days and as the kitchen is small was difficult to work with as there is no bench space so you have to use the stove top. The fridge was large and noisy (as most are) so we turned it off at night and back on the next morning which was fine. We had everything we needed to make breakfast as we ate all other meals out. Would be good to have a smaller bar fridge the top of which could be used as bench space."
11306586,75040434,2016-05-18,15959243,Brian,"Perfect Airbnb for Beacon Hill.  Clean, well appointed and convenient."
"Not luxurious but an upgrade from a hotel room for sure.\"",,,,,
11306586,75612422,2016-05-22,365857,Lucas,"The internal side of the studio perfectly corresponds to the pictures. Eddie was punctual on bringing the keys and showing us the appartment. We had clean towels, shampoo, soap, toillet paper, kitchen items perfectly at our disposal."
The great problem is that this is an underground appartment. The windows can not be openned and there is almost no natural light in the room. Besides the wrong street number is registered on airbnb,and corresponds to a buiding with no underground appartments and a nicer facade. We felt very disapointed on this one. This should be corrected and included to the description.,,,,
Other than that,the neighborhood is excellent,"quiet and peaceful.\"",,,
11306586,78799612,2016-06-09,39719917,William,"The listing was accurate, 1 bedroom studio in the lovely Beacon Hill neighborhood. Close to everything in downtown Boston and accessible to Boston Common and the public transit. Close to Whole Foods Market and tons of dining spots and historic Freedom Trail.  Kevin, an associate of Alan's met us at the apartment, checked us in, and walked us through the space. Being an older building, it can be a little warm, but an AC unit and fan were provided to circulate the air and keep the stuffiness away. Overall it was an enjoyable stay in Boston and the location of this place aided significantly in any of the activities my fiancee and I chose to pursue."
11306586,79425756,2016-06-12,70150980,Jason,I was very pleased with the responsive communication from Alan as well as Eddie when we arrived. Met promptly and was very helpful getting us settled in the studio. It was exactly as advertised and located in what I would consider the perfect place for ease of access to the entire city. We will most definitely stay with them again...thanks to Alan and Eddie for helping our anniversary trip work out so nicely!
11306586,81440480,2016-06-23,71163335,Rusty,"Right in the heart of Beacon Hill. This was our first trip to Boston and the place was perfect for us. Safe area, clean and comfortable accommodations. Plus Eddie gave us a lot of great city recommendations for our brief 2 night stay. We'd stay there again for sure."
11306586,84503441,2016-07-07,35139156,Michael,"When the Airbnb was available, Eddie called us to let us know where to meet him. Very easy to get to. He showed us around and gave us our keys. That was the beginning of a great vacation! There was even cold beer in the fridge! During our stay, we needed extra towels and linens. Delivered within minutes! Very comfortable unit. Quiet too. Great location. Walking distance to everywhere! AC worked well. Did I mention the great location! Boston is a very beautiful city. We will be back. And hope this unit is available!"
11306586,86051542,2016-07-14,30847977,Richard,"Great location near Boston Common, the Park St. T stop, and two blocks from Whole Foods. The basement apartment was nice and clean and everything worked."
11306586,87574797,2016-07-20,9276389,Christine,"I really only have 3 requirements in a place to stay- cleanliness, location, and the right price. This little studio is all 3 of those things. And on top of that the hosts are great communicators and so friendly and accommodating as well! We had the best time exploring everything there is to see in Boston from this awesome location!"
11306586,89196908,2016-07-27,53277582,Kirk,The description of the location was accurate. We did self check-in and had no problems. Eddie got in touch with us shortly after we landed to make sure we knew what to do and gave us traveling instructions to get to the location.
The apartment had everything we needed (AC,WiFi,iron,hair dryer,etc) and our hosts made sure we knew we could let them know if we needed anything else. The location was fantastic. We easily walked to almost everywhere we went on our trip and public transportation is a short way away. The neighborhood is charming and anything you need (restaurants,convenience stores
"We definitely plan on staying at Alan and Eddie's place again if it's available the next time we go to Boston.\"",,,,,
11306586,89483253,2016-07-28,51966960,Michael,Perfect location for exploring Boston!Two disappointing things about our stay:  Wi-fi connection was horrible.  Bummed that we had to spend $84 for parking that was nowhere close to our accommodations. Why not purchase a resident parking permit that can be given to visitors so that they can park in the neighborhood during their stay and returned to you when they leave?
11306586,90317222,2016-07-31,35664629,Sandy,"The location is perfect for experiencing Boston. We enjoyed walking the Freedom Trail, free walking tours from Faniul Hall, a trolley tour, a schooner sail, lobster rolls, pastries in Litle Italy, and much more....all walking distance from Myrtle Street."

The apartment was in great shape and is close walking distance to Boston Commons, Little Italy, and the Massachusetts State House."
11306586,93823686,2016-08-14,23465781,Judy,Great location. Plenty of room for 2 people. Big tv. Great shower
11306586,95385695,2016-08-19,51366014,Paulina,"We loved the location. Everything was very accessible from where we were staying. We wish we met Alan in person, but he made sure his associate introduced us to the place. The apartment itself was big enough for us, although it's worth mentioning the place is underground (dark inside) and when AC is on it's a bit loud."
11306586,96591063,2016-08-23,28937527,Kim,This apartment is in an ideal location in Beacon Hill...walkable to everything. It is perfect for a single traveller or couple who want an affordable place to stay while they explore the city. The hosts were easy to reach & helpful when needed. The space isn't large but it is clean and is a good spot to go back to after a busy day enjoying downtown.
13249829,86379429,2016-07-16,71042869,Hyewon,"Although Vincent was not present, we were welcomed in every way. The greatest advantage of Vincent's home was its location and reasonable price. Compared to the outrageous and over-priced Airbnb properties in Boston, Vincent's rate was fairly reasonable."
His home is located in Beacon Hills,and it is a beautiful neighborhood. The buildings are over 100 years old,but his place was renovated,and there were no problems with the amenities (water/heating/air-condition). It only takes 1 stop to MIT,and 4 stops to Harvard,and it is near almost everywhere (including tourist attractions).
Air conditioners were provided for the hot summer days,and Vincent was kind to provide weekly professional cleaning on Saturdays. We were very busy,so to have someone clean the house each week was incredibly helpful.,,,
I truly enjoyed my daily trips across the Charles river,and the breath-taking sunsets on Beacon Hills. I want to thank Vincent for his hospitality through prompt replies to my questions and requests,and I hope to have the chance to reside again in the near future.,,,

4489490,27508949,2015-03-06,27903851,Michael,"This apartment was exactly what I was looking for. It was comfortable, clean, quiet, well equipped, and close to everything. The Wifi worked great and the internet connection was fast. There was even a ethernet cable for directly connecting to the internet. This is one of many nice touches that makes this apartment stand out. The cable TV had more than just the basic channels. The kitchen is a full kitchen and there are plenty of cooking utensils. A laundry room is located just downstairs and it has commercial quality machines.  The MIT campus, the park, and the T are just a short walk away and there are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants just outside the door. There is also a CVS and a grocery store just down the street. It's hard to beat the Beacon Hill neighborhood! It's fun and easy to live in.  Uber cars are everywhere. I think the longest I waited for a ride was 2 minutes. I never needed to rent a car.  Adam was easy to work with. The check in and check out procedures are simple and don't require that you meet with anyone. They have a convenient system for getting a key from a lock box. This makes check in and check out a breeze at any time of day. All in all, this was a great experience. I will definitely stay here again."

4489490,72562739,2016-05-03,17051569,Derk-Jan,An excellent apartment in the heart of Beacon Hill - one of the best neighbourhoods in Boston. Lots of cafes & cute shops to explore right outside the door. The apartment was clean and just as in the pictures. Great welcome basket with some essential refreshments. Excellent communication from the host & very easy check-in/out procedure. We requested more towels which were brought over straight away. All in all an excellent experience and highly recommended.
4489490,75079106,2016-05-18,66737087,Diane,The studio was a little smaller than expected but clean and well equipped.   We had to contact Adam and his team on a couple of matters and they quickly responded.  Location couldn't have been better.   We very much enjoyed our stay.
4489490,77236202,2016-05-30,44626548,John,The apartment is small but has everything you need. Great location with easy parking a block away.

The localization in Charles Street in Beacon is impossible to beat, with best option for shopping and eateries of all kinds, and always high quality. I was always supported by Adam or somebody else at any time we needed it. The subway was very close and Boston Common too. It was a great time there and I certainly recommend it."

8052617,48103758,2015-09-23,15787229,John,"Paige was in communication at all times and quickly supplied a few necessities that were missing from the apt. Her description of the apartment was very good; in fact it was more space than we expected, the furnishings excellent, and the price below what a similar apartment would run. The neighborhood was great with a market nearby on Broadway and a 20 minute walk to the World trade pier area. I would take her apartment again if I return to Boston."
8052617,48348912,2015-09-25,16438123,Bradley,Great neighborhood.  Easy access and a wonderful apartment.

The house itself was great. Super clean with lots of room. Beautiful kitchen,fireplace etc. It's a perfect place for 4-6 people.,,,,
Paige was incredibly responsive and even let us keep our bags at the apartment a few hours after our initial check out time because of our later flight time.,,,,,
Only one consideration: if you're hoping to do a lot of cooking at the apartment,the kitchen is very nice - new appliances,granite countertops etc. However,there aren't many kitchen tools to work with (ie knives,"plates etc). Just something to keep in mind.\"",

8052617,50211075,2015-10-10,31234753,Vanessa,"La casa es realmente bonita y muy tranquila. Queda cerca de una estacion de metro y una calle mas arriba tienes comercios con bares, restaurantes, supermercados...Solo echamos de menos tener wifi, no se por qué pero no nos funcionaba. A Paige no la conocimos pero estubo atenta a nuestros mensajes y fue flexible con nuestra salida,ya que tuvimos que dejar las maletas hasta nuestra salida. Fuimos 3 amigos y quedamos muy contentos."
8052617,50792004,2015-10-14,16438123,Bradley,This is the third time I have stayed here.   It was flawless again.
8052617,50950287,2015-10-16,32253048,Birgit,"Very Spacecius flat, 2 bathrooms and a nice deck outside the living room"
8052617,51443919,2015-10-20,30609577,Joel,"The place was a really nice apartment and in a decent neighbourhood. Its not in the city but there are a few really nice places around there for food and drink, like the The Lincoln Tavern and across the road from that - Loco. If you are there for a convention then it is quite convenient as you can walk there (if you don't mind a little bit of a walk) The only thing I would say on the negative side is there are few essential items missing which we couldn't find:"
Iron - they have a steamer but its not the same and an Iron would have helped.,,,,,
Hair Dryer - I know my wife really needed one and we couldn't find one for the life of us.,,,,,
Bath gel  - they supplied Shampoo Conditioner and body lotion in little packages but again couldnt actually find soap or body gel.,,,,,
"I want to make clear the place is great and Paige was very helpful these are just those few little extra things that would have made me give the place 5 stars instead of 4. \"",,,,,
8052617,53608751,2015-11-10,8067807,Sarah,"Paige's apartment is spacious, beautiful and in close proximity to great shops, food and the convention center. We would definitely stay here again. Quiet neighborhood close to many great Boston sites."
8052617,53886596,2015-11-14,43690378,Kimberly,"Great location. Convenient access.  Place is clean and comfortable. Nicely appointed.  Coordination was easy, helping to make the stay pleasurable.  Would absolutely stay here again; especially for any events at the convention center which is less than 1/2 mile away."
8052617,54207159,2015-11-16,44963696,Jessica,"Clean, comfortable and as described.  Good location, easy to get to from airport and close to many sought-after locations in South Boston.  While clean and comfortable, don't expect more than the minimum (soap in the shower, hand towels in bathrooms, tissues, hair dryer, etc.).  That was disappointing and made the stay less enjoyable."
8052617,54461351,2015-11-20,5898460,Cynthia,This was fine nice place
8052617,55666699,2015-12-04,16438123,Bradley,This is the third or fourth time I've stayed here.   It is a wonderful place that seems like home.  The bed is very comfortable.   Paige is an excellent host and the neighborhood is great.
8052617,55886954,2015-12-06,50668861,Bruno,The host canceled this reservation 254 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8052617,56305621,2015-12-12,19625177,Nikki,"This Airbnb experience was not the greatest. I wanted to really like this place but it wasn't quite what I expected based on the listing. The listing states the house sleeps 6 but in reality it sleeps 2. There was one bed and one air bed when we arrived. In order to accommodate our group of 5, I had to make a run to Target to buy additional air mattresses and linens. To make matters more challenging, Paige is not the owner of the property. She only manages it and was not in town to help the night we arrived. She kept telling me there was an extra air mattress in the unit but it was no where to be found. The shower downstairs did not work leaving our mixed gender group to share a single bathroom. The door on the upstairs bathroom is a wooden sliding door which is very difficult to open and hard to tell if anyone is on the other side. The pull out couch this listing promises is really a sectional that extends 3-4 inches and that's about it. I'm struggling to find good things to say about this place as it wasn't nearly as cool as the other places I have stayed. This place might be ok for a single person or a couple but not a group."
8052617,57495900,2015-12-26,15177288,Marques,"Breathtaking,left speechless. Great feel, great environment"
8052617,57616279,2015-12-27,15177288,Marques,"Paige was incredible. Everything about the place and her communication was astounding. She really made the experience worth every little bit of it. I even had the pleasure of meeting her too which was breathtaking. I definitely would love to stay at her place again if ever in the area. If you're looking for a great relaxing environment, then this is the one. Thought about it all the way back home."
8052617,57741933,2015-12-28,15177288,Marques,Paige made my whole experience worthwhile. She was very kind and patient. Always willing to communicate and aid in any way. Great host
8052617,58924319,2016-01-05,22374232,Charles,Very nice apartment and spacious. Great for 4 people. Parking was manageable as well and the area has a lot of bars within walking distance.
8052617,59871358,2016-01-16,47883062,Ben,"Paige was incredibly responsive, helpful, and flexible. The place was as described and worked well for our purposes of attending a conference at a nearby hotel. I would certainly stay here again."
8052617,61197005,2016-02-01,2290154,Masis,"We had a very nice stay at Paige's place, communication with her was excellent and the apartment was as described, very clean and comfortable. The bedrooms were upstairs and this part of the apartment was warmer (comfortable) than the main level where the kitchen, dining and living room. She was very responsive and a pleasure to deal with, I have no reservation recommending or staying again at this lovely apartment. Walking distance to restaurants, bars, etc."
8052617,63393888,2016-02-22,3837866,Paul,Paige is awesome!!! An associate and I were attending the New England Boat Show and needed parking. When I emailed Paige she indicated they didn't have parking but she would find a way to accommodate us and she did. A parking spot around the corner. Overall the unit was great but Paige made it truly special. Will definitely be back next year.
8052617,65002753,2016-03-10,40547557,Bob,Everything was as represented. Paige always responded promptly. I would recommend hes as a host
8052617,65747499,2016-03-16,17972339,Connor,"Paige and Amber were available at all times, check in was extremely easy - check out even easier. The experience was very nice. The apartment is gorgeous and very spacious - it is on two levels, has two full bathrooms and two full bedrooms. The bathrooms are exquisite, kitchen very nice, and there's a huge TV! The only difficulty was parking. I highly suggest paying $30 for a parking pass!"
8052617,66170518,2016-03-20,45403542,Claudette,Comfortable stay. Lots of room to spread out. Parking available across the street or around the corner on Broadway. Fast and easy communication with host.
8052617,66447733,2016-03-22,25687967,Casey,Such a cute place! Super easy to follow directions
8052617,68017239,2016-04-01,63158832,Sarah Anne,"I would definitely recommend renting this house! It was really nice and above what I expected. They have enough appliances in the kitchen to be able to cook a lot of different things (grilled cheese maker, teapot, ect) and have more than enough towels and sheets. The neighborhood is pretty quiet and close to a lot of cool restaurants and spots. I didn't pay extra for parking, but it wasn't hard to find a spot on the street not too far away. Check in and check out was super easy, and Paige was really nice and helpful. I would definitely like to stay here again next time I'm in Boston :)"
8052617,68348129,2016-04-04,15493321,Allison,"\"This place worked out very well, great location for our conference at the Convention Center (the walk is only about 10 minutes or so). Very cozy, loved the kitchen, wish mine were that nice! The master bed was ridiculously comfortable. Just a couple of small things: if the upstairs couch \"\"opens up into a full size bed\"\" as advertised"
8052617,68922075,2016-04-07,26853814,Hoala,Listing was accurate. Paige was easy to get ahold of via text message.
8052617,69540413,2016-04-11,36129047,Kristen,Very easy to get in and out of the apartment! Was a great location for me and my colleagues for our conference at the convention center - a quick walk to work and many options for food around the apartment. Would definitely stay again for another conference - beats a hotel!
8052617,70441425,2016-04-17,21490332,Ahmed,"The place was really amazing, just as described and shown in the photos. The apartment was clean, and I found lots of towels,  blankets, dishes, cups, etc. I even found some water bottles in the fridge."
I really liked the way I checked in and out.,,,,,
"The neighbourhood was quite and there were many parking lots in the streets (it was for free in the weekend). I really enjoyed my stay.  \"",,,,,
8052617,71253533,2016-04-24,23071674,Dan,"Paige was extremely helpful in setting up our stay and securing a parking space for us ($30 a day in a lot around the corner from the apartment).  She was quick to respond and pleasant to work with.  The space is large and very pretty, but it does have a bit of a model home/museum feel to it.  I am almost certain that no one actually lives there and my friends kept finding little quirks with the house.  Overall it was a comfortable place to stay for a weekend at the convention center, but not the most authentic, cozy place in the world."
8052617,72280530,2016-05-01,67935259,Elizabeth,"Paige was incredibly friendly, easy to get a hold of and professional. Great, clean apartment with great amenities! Easy to get into Boston and great value!"
8052617,73271473,2016-05-07,61538991,Nichol,"The house was exactly as advertised.  Paige was very responsive to any questions leading up to our trip.  While staying she was also quick to respond when we had accidentally parked in the wrong lot.  She answered my call early in the morning and had me take pictures of the parking lot to make sure I was in the right place.  Very professional, and went above and beyond."
8052617,74202583,2016-05-14,70730190,Jeremy,"The house was awesome! Very clean and all amenities provided. Beds were super comfortable. If I were to change one thing I would have opted for the parking spot, but that was my fault. Would absolutely recommend and will definitely stay again myself."
8052617,75052859,2016-05-18,63937912,David,Everything was perfect! Paige does a wonderful communicating and is very responsive when you have questions both before and during your visit. The house was clean felt like a home not a rental. I traveled to Boston on business and wanted to stay near the convention center and this location was perfect. It is about 15 minutes walking time from the convention center to the property. It is also very close to stores and restaurants. I highly recommend this property! If this doesn't work for your needs contact Paige and I'm sure she has one that will if you are visiting the Boston area.
8052617,76298874,2016-05-26,36426006,Ashley,"\"Fantastic place in a great area. \"\"Southie\"\" as it is known to the locals is one of the cool places to be with a lot of younger adults living there. Also has some great restaurants and bars to choose from. This will definitely be my go to place if I'm ever back in Boston.\""
8052617,76835007,2016-05-29,41000481,Allison,Paige did a wonderful job. Her space was emaculate and far exceeded our expectations.  It was a nice touch to have extra toiletries for us. She also had a few paper products.  The patio and Jacuzzi were amazing. It was also nice to be close to bars and restaurants as well as public transportation. She was always very responsive and that was  she was always very responsive and that was helpful.
8052617,77588170,2016-06-02,31734305,Bob,Great Host. Five star!

8052617,79155505,2016-06-11,4243526,Joe And Catherine,"The apartment, in the heart of Southie, was exactly as described. Two full bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a nice kitchen make this a great place for a family. There is also a small outside balcony if the weather is nice."
8052617,80346321,2016-06-17,30286367,Erin,Paige's place was perfect! It was the ideal location and a fantastic apartment. It was well stocked with anything you'd need and Paige was extremely helpful and supportive. The week in Boston was perfect and we loved Paige's place!
8052617,80673039,2016-06-19,57019204,Conor,Very nice apartment in a nice neighborhood. Would stay again. Thanks!
8052617,82680126,2016-06-28,2261492,Lindsay,Location was great.  Apartment was cute and cozy for my family.  A lot of narrow and steep steps so important to note if stairs are a challenge.  We had our car towed although we paid and parked in the proper parking lot.  Situation was resolved as promptly as possible but it was a hassle.
8052617,83536853,2016-07-03,61826292,Jamaree,"Very nice house , everything in description was there !"
8052617,84505582,2016-07-07,13689711,Na,"The unit is tastefully renovated. The location is in south boston. The beds are not the best.  One was entirely too soft and the other was in between soft and firm.  Better ventilation could be had in the unit as it does have a strong smell when you first enter. The neighborhood has tons of good restaurants  and local coffee shops. The distance to the T was a bit far (5 blocks) so for a family with a baby, it was a bit of a hassle to schedule in an afternoon nap at our temporary home.  Overall, it was a good stay."
8052617,85700505,2016-07-12,29287310,Kevin,"Paige was a very accommodating host, the place was just as described in pictures and descriptions. The unit was nicely remodeled and the neighborhood is a really nice up and coming area of Boston."
"2 things to note: The unit has very steep stairs to walk up to the unit which may not be great for elderly people or for young children. Window coverings in the bedrooms allow a lot of light through so bring eye masks (fortunately we did) if you don't sleep well in bright sunlight.\"",,,,,
8052617,86553671,2016-07-16,12285500,Emily,"Paige was really great with communication and always responded quickly with accurate information. The apartment was very nice and suited our needs perfectly (attending a conference in the Seaport district). There were plenty of shops, bars and restaurants close by and the area felt very friendly. It was about 15 mins walk to the metro."
8052617,89318943,2016-07-28,18582563,Thomas,Paige did a great job giving me the arrival info I needed and accurately describing the apartment.
8052617,89780674,2016-07-30,85884465,Almamy,"It was a great area, and good experience if I ever go to Boston I'm booking that house."
8052617,90665035,2016-08-01,68864168,Rebecca,"Check in was very easy thanks to Paige's text and email prior to visiting.  The condo was very spacious and in a great location.  We were able to walk to grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants with our 11 month old.  This is a dog friendly unit, and there were some balls of fur left from the previous renter, but it did not bother us.  We had a great time."
8052617,91385516,2016-08-05,41392507,Tommy And Elise,"Paige's apartment was beautiful, clean, and well located! We really enjoyed our short stay. There were many walkable cafes and restaurants- our favorite was a polish restaurant called Cafe Polonia. There's also a little park a block away that came in handy with our toddler. Paige was very responsive over Air Bnb messenger, and was able to accommodate an early check in for us after a red eye from Seattle. We were VERY grateful for that."
8052617,93078930,2016-08-11,77518540,Brendan,Couldn't have been more perfect.

8052617,96070823,2016-08-21,75210975,Randy,"What a beautiful home! Beds were incredibly comfortable, very large on the interior, A/C was INCREDIBLY effective during the hot summer and the location was fantastic. Short walk to great nightlife (great dive bar down the street), Dunkin Donuts for coffee and awesome local food spots of South Boston. Could not recommend this place more."
6310903,32727322,2015-05-20,15107598,Edward,House is beautifully restored victorian.  Spacious and very charming.
The hosts were very accommodating leaving us some snacks and such.,,,,,

Les lits sont confortables,la cuisine et les salles de bain sont fonctionnelles,la petite cour arrière est très agréable. Nous avons eu l'occasion d'aller marcher dans le quartier et c'était vraiment plaisant. Il y a un parc tout près,la plage n'est pas loin non plus et l'arrêt d'autobus est juste en face de la maison. La station de métro n'est pas très loin (environ 15 minutes). C'est un très beau quartier,on s'y sentait comme chez nous.,
Il est certain que nous retournerons chez James lorsque nous irons dans le coin de Boston,nous n'aurions pas pu trouver mieux. Nous avons même été accueillis en français par une amie du propriétaire,"très gentille.\"",,,
6310903,34454663,2015-06-08,5525432,Lynne,"Jim's charming Victorian home was exactly as described: comfortable and warm, and in a great location. My mother, sisters and nieces spent a wonderful girls' weekend in the house, with easy access to the downtown Boston sites and nearby amenities. South Boston is a vibrant neighborhood with much to offer on its own. Parking was a breeze, and we never had to use the parking space set aside for the house, although we were very happy to have that option."
Jim was a gracious host,and made us feel very welcome in his space. When the party grew from the original four to six,he was flexible and accommodated us without a problem. If we're ever looking for a house in Boston for the weekend,we'll definitely try to stay at Jim's charming Victorian home again.,,
Thank you,"Jim!\"",,,,
6310903,36190955,2015-06-26,33243426,Keith,"Our 1st Airbnb experience, and it was an incredible one thanks to James!  It made believers of my cautiously skeptical wife and mother-in-law.  The home was exactly as described: charming (beautiful, really, with all the period details such as tall ceilings, stained glass windows, incredible woodwork throughout, etc.).  The entire home is tastefully decorated. Moreover, the place was SPOTLESS.  It had all the amenities of home to make us feel comfortable.  James was a gracious and conscientious host.  Upon handing over the house to us, he gave a thorough tour, showed us where takeout menus were, provided written instructions to orient us with the neighborhood, etc.  He anticipated and proactively addressed all of our needs. Additionally, he remained available by cell throughout our 8-day visit, to address any questions that came up during our stay.  The neighborhood is amazing- a vibrant, energetic, community, offering nightlife and excellent dining options for those who wish to partake.  The location of the house is central to all modes of transportation."

James has been really nice all the time. His friend Liette was wating for us when we arrived and explaned everything although James write very clear lots of things we could need. Every time I texted him,he answer me inmediatly.,,,,

After arriving, there were clear and thorough guest instructions detailing parking and other important information about the area.  The house was beautiful, immaculate, and in a great location.   The backyard garden and patio were a bonus, and perfect for dinner and a glass of wine.  We enjoyed exploring the South Boston neighborhood, and a highlight of the trip was a bicycle tour of Boston's historical sights.  The property is also close to the beach and the seaport, and only a short taxi ride to central Boston.  The trip was wonderful, and we would certainly stay at this property again!"
6310903,39771806,2015-07-26,31119997,Hye Sun,"After coming back my home country, I am thinking of James's house. It was really far more than expected. This is my first experience of air b&b, and it's just amazing. The house was beautiful and spatious (actually even larger for four of us) and clean and cozy and convinient like home. Most of all, I love the big kitchen and the beautiful backyards. James left us the very detailed instruction paper and it very much helped. At arrival night , we dined at the more than 100 year old restaurant where he recommended to us and it's just great. The subway station (broadway station) was not so far and bus stop was just in front of the house. How convinient it was! We fully enjoyed Boston's life because of this gorgeous house stay. Thanks to James and his friend Liette! I wish I would come back there again soon or later and one hundred percent rcommend this house to everyone without any hesitation. Thanks again!!!"
6310903,44451681,2015-08-26,39970085,Rob,"We arrived at this home to find it exactly as shown in the photos. A beautiful victorian home, clean and spacious. James ensured our check in was smooth and did everything he could to inform us of a last minute change in plans. The house is charming (as advertised!) and anything you might need is available. The backyard garden was beautiful and so peaceful. Information provided was very helpful. We highly recommend this home! Thank you James."
6310903,45557092,2015-09-04,34730677,Laurissa,"We had a wonderful family vacation in Boston due in part to James' delightful Victorian home in a cool South Boston neighbourhood with great access to public transit -- just as described in the listing. Even prior to arriving, James was helpful with directions to use public transport from the airport, recommendations for local grocery stories and restaurants. We choose to use public transit on this trip and it paid off as all major attractions are accessible from James' house. We couldn't imagine driving or parking a car in Boston. James made sure we were met when we arrived and were shown how to use of all the amenities in the home (e.g. air conditioners, etc.).  We had access to his fully stocked kitchen making meal time with a large family easier. The bedrooms were clean and comfortable.  The bathrooms spacious, clean and had great water pressure. All in all a wonderful place to come back to after a day of sightseeing."

The house was beautiful, sparkling clean and superbly stocked with everything we could possibly need. And even though I was a little worried about the staircase – which James had been very upfront about – it was no problem at all, even for my mother who was unwell and had to be rushed to the hospital during the stay."
The location of the house is very central and there is a bus line that runs right in front,making for an easy commute to literally everywhere in Boston. James had also very kindly left a parking pass and secret tips on how to get parking close by,which is a blessing in Boston.,,,
All the instructions,in fact,were very clear and James made sure he was just a phone call away for anything that was needed. The WiFi signal was superb – even on the topmost floor – which was a Godsend.,,,
All in all,it was a wonderful stay in every way... thank you,"James. \"",,,

Mirrors in bathroom very small and high on the wall, difficult for shorter people. Dryer belt squeaks terribly. Location is fine, Uber was great to take to north end. Great coffee shop right around the corner!"

She showed us around the house, went through some papers with us about parking, getting into Boston, restaurants etc.  She also told us to help ourselves to whatever was in the kitchen.  The house is wonderful. The beds were comfortable. The rooms were decorated very nicely. The bathrooms were very large and clean.  We had a little trouble getting the picture on the tv. I texted James and he called me immediately and talked me through it.  The parking can be a hassle, other then that, everything was great.  I would definitely recommend staying here."

6310903,52481302,2015-10-30,8588570,Karen,James' home is wonderful.  Everything that you would expect from a Boston townhouse.  It is three stories and we had full-run of the entire house.
South Boston is charming and the no. 9 bus which stops right outside the house takes you to Copley from where you can go anywhere in the city.,,,,,
James was extremely generous in sharing his home with us and we would obviously recommend this great house very highly.  We would love to visit Boston again and would love to stay at James' house.,,,,,

I love antiques and art - so this was perfect! Everything was just as described,clean,comfortable & cozy! With 6 people,the home was quite spacious. Several relatives live in the area,so it was very convenient to meet them downtown,etc. Parking our rental car was not a problem what so ever

We had planned a trip months ago to view the St Patrick's Day Southie Parade (I have two elderly parents so the location was ideal, they could view right from the window!) The house looks beautiful in the pictures but is so much more beautiful in person - it is just so charming and spacious!  The bedrooms were very comfortable and the bathrooms were huge.  The kitchen has all the fixings, and the island makes it a fun place to hang out.  You can't beat the location either.  The bus stop is right out front and the parking space provided is an easy ten minute walk.  There are a few pubs right around the corner too!  We will definitely be back! :)"

Convenience stores and restaurants are around the corner, the bus stop right outside the house and the convention center is a very pleasant 20 minute walk. The kitchen is wonderfully stocked and James was very kind to open the breakfast pantry to us. The bedroom on the third level was even provided with an additional space heater to keep us warm. The house rules are simple and easy to follow. Overall, a wonderful experience! Highly recommended!! Thank you, James, for a wonderful stay in Boston."

The house was the perfect place for me and my colleagues! It was super close to the facility, had a lot to offer in its surrounding neighborhood and was just perfect in any way! James is a very nice host who was available via email and phone all the time. The house itself is very big and cozy - also we had not really much time to enjoy it after 12-14 hour work days. But it gave us the feeling of a home and team spirit under one roof! Thanks James for your sacrifice to rent us your beautiful home for such a long time!

The house was spacious and comfortable and we ate outside in the small,"but attractive garden. We also thought the photos did not do the house justice. The kitchen was well equipped although being English we missed having a kettle. The bathrooms were beautifully clean and spacious with very good showers.

We were very happy with the accommodation, with two double beds, one double sofa-bed and one single bed in four separate rooms. The living space downstairs has traditional decoration, a well-equipped kitchen and a charming garden / terrace to sit out in. The location is convenient for a short cab ride (or a slightly longer walk) to the convention centre, local shops and places to eat and drink, and walking or jogging out around the coast with views of the harbour. I would mention some traffic noise in the front bedrooms from the road and a bus stop outside the house, but overall we were very happy with our choice to stay here rather than in a big hotel."

Melissa was wonderful,warm and helpful!  She gave us directions and a map of all the cool places to eat and visit in Jamaica Plain.  The room has a comfortable bed,antique dresser and its own private bath.  Melissa welcomed us into her house,which is nicely furnished and has lovely artwork on every wall.  There is also a nice deck and table and chairs off the kitchen.  We hope to be able to stay with her again the next time we are in Boston!,,

Acacia was a welcome addition to our stay and I got in plenty of puppy love while we were there. Be prepared for a big barky greeting,but once she got to know us,she was calm and well behaved and loved showing off her stuffed toys.,,,

Emily's apartment is close to three of the green lines (B, C, D), and I could easily get to the BC campus using the B line. The apartment is located near Cleveland Circle, close to several restaurants and some shops, right across from a bar, and it takes about half an hour using the C line to get to the Back Bay from the apartment."
The place was clean and had a homelike,lived-in feel to it,with clean towels and bedding provided. It has a spacious living room and a nice kitchen. While not luxurious,it is very convenient,and a great value if you wish to stay in this neighborhood. There is even a swimming pool in the courtyard,where you can sunbathe or eat your take-out food.

She got me the keys over expedited mail, which was very nice, especially due to me asking to stay so close to when I actually stayed over."
She had a sublet before we arrived,so she didn't have a chance to make sure the place was clean,but made sure to tell me,and we arranged a compromise based on that. The place ended up being well maintained,very spacious,and in a nice part of town.

I would stay here again! Highly recommended.

I believe it's a corner unit so it's long and stretches across a few different rooms. Lots of light comes in through the multiple windows-which is pretty during the fall. It faces the courtyard, so it's not loud with street noise. There is a 7-11 and a food store right around the corner, and a bar and restaurants across the street. There are multiple closets for coats etc. The bathroom is small, so for more than one person, it might be a problem. I met Emily and she is great! She was quick getting back to me with any issues I had. One problem is if you have a car, there is only street parking with permits in the immediate area-I ended up renting a parking space. Location is great otherwise. THANKS Emily!  :)"

The neighborhood is great, it has three train lines very close by, a CVS, Starbucks, and a few other stores right at your door. Just outside you have the Chestnut Hill Reservoir which is great to go for a run, or just to take a walk in a beautiful place. It was a very safe building. We ordered a few things online and packages would stay downstairs even for a few days and nothing would happen to them until you picked them up."
Although this has more to do with the building than with the apartment,the heating was a bit irregular on our stay. Sometimes it would get too hot even with the radiators off and some other times it was a bit cold,but nothing you couldn't fix by opening a few windows or putting on a sweater,respectively.,,
As for Emily,she was always very nice and was prompt to answer all our questions.,,,,

Furthermore, there was a mishap in my traveling plans and I requested to stay at her apartment an additional night.

9248612,80766144,2016-06-19,25665036,Meagan,"Carmela was a great host. We stayed there for a surprise birthday weekend for my fiancé with a few of our close friends. She was so helpful in providing everything I needed for this special weekend. She even left us a very hospitable, welcoming bottle of wine to celebrate! The key exchange was very clear and we had no problems with anything logistical. My only issue was that we didn't know the place wasnt a/c central air. There was a window unit but nothing that could cool the whole place down, which I kinda felt bad about with our invited friends. We stayed there during a pretty warm weekend so although there were cool nights, the place got a little stuffy for 6 ppl. We loved the location which was only a $12-15 uber ride to Fenway. Overall it was a success! Thanks, Carmela! :)"
9248612,82181519,2016-06-26,4260911,William,Everything about this place is great. Plenty of space for the 5 of us and very clean. Overall the apt had a very warm feeling and made you feel right at home.
You can't beat the neighborhood. I have been to Boston a few times and always make it a point to stop in Beacon Hill. It is full of these classic townhouses/brownstones and beautiful tree lined streets and alleys. Also very close to a T station (the local Metro) so you can get anywhere in the city fairly easy.,,,,,

I loved looking at the pictures made by her children through out the kitchen.. so adorable!  It was so warm and welcoming - felt like I was staying at a friend's house.  Molly left great directions for us and she prepared a very useful guide to the area.  We had clean sheets and towels ready for us when we arrived.  The location is just a bit outside of the city, but it was easy enough to get around. We went to a Red Sox game at night and the trip wasn't bad using public transportation.. even a cab back was only $15. Overall great experience.. I would definitely recommend staying here!"

It is also easy to get to many of the major research centers i.e. Dana-Faber etc. from her place. Her place was spacious & the room was big, I did my work mostly on the red extra couch in the room. Molly was nice enough to provide me with an extra heater in addition to the central heating system.

2798787,54190276,2015-11-16,40315863,BethAndJohn,"The room in Molly's house was just as described-- cozy and comfortable on a windy November day.  Molly was very responsive... including providing dinner and breakfast restaurant recommendations and information about parking and transit.  The house is walking distance to the T (though we never used it) and parking was available on the street.  The bed was comfortable and room was bright and sunny.  The bath is shared with the family, but it never posed a problem.  Checking in and out with the key box was easy.  Thanks for a lovely stay!"
2798787,54723859,2015-11-23,11881900,Jacob,"Molly's place was wonderful! She's an excellent host and she went out of her way to provide all kinds of things-- from towels to detailed guides of Boston-- waiting for us in our room. The room itself is just as it looks in the photo: warm, spacious, and yet cozy and comfortable. And the Jamaica Plain neighbourhood felt like a nice place to stay for us first-time visitors to Boston; it's well-connected via the T and buses to more central parts of the city, but has nice and inexpensive cafe and restaurant options (highlights being the Cuban restaurants) that aren't so easy to spot in the city."
"Can't recommend Molly highly enough! \"",,,,,
2798787,55306098,2015-11-29,33330058,Jessie,Very nice host and her cute kids!The room is very neat and beautiful decorated. A really great experience in Boston.
2798787,55576341,2015-12-02,1530004,Anthony,Molly was very welcoming and helpful before I arrived as well as through my stay.  The room was very comfortable and clean - right across the hall from the bathroom.  Easy access to the T to get anywhere in the city.  Would highly recommend staying there.
2798787,55803520,2015-12-06,47334148,Kelly,"Molly was an absolutely incredible host! The room was clean, stocked with plenty of fresh towels, a space heater, magazines, and a visitors guide that she made with so much information about the surrounding area of Jamaica Plain (food, stores, attractions, you name it!). She also included a map of the T system which was super helpful for me as a first time visitor to the Boston area. She was incredibly sweet and had left a handwritten note for me upon my arrival welcoming me and asking me to please text so she knew I arrived okay :) She really goes the extra mile to make sure her guests feel welcome and well taken care of. I had a very positive experience and would absolutely recommend this airbnb to anyone!"
2798787,56607801,2015-12-15,35461372,Alexis,Molly was a wonderful host! The room and house were kept very clean and she was very welcoming. I would definitely stay here again if I came back to Boston and would recommend it to anyone!

2798787,58844231,2016-01-05,14541099,Sharmilla,"Staying here was a wonderful experience from beginning to end. Molly was extremely clear and detailed with information on getting to and settling into her place before we arrived, and was always accessible via the phone or email."
The room was so cosy and comfortable,perfect for a few days' stay and to come back to at the end of the day. The rest of the house is equally lovely - definitely lived in,but very clean and comfortable.,,,
Molly had even provided some welcome treats as well as plenty of information on getting around Boston in our room - things to see,eat,do,etc. She and her kids were also very welcoming of us into their home,and we really felt like we were staying with friends.,
It's a great location to stay in as well,just a few blocks away from the train station that takes you directly into Boston. There are also several buses that run very close to the house that were very convenient. There are many restaurants and shops within walking distance.,,,,
Overall,I'd highly recommend this place!,,,,

2798787,60128421,2016-01-19,50405842,Margot,Molly is great! Completely laid-back and friendly and helpful...
We loved her home,the room,and the neighborhood! This was exactly what we were looking for: an easy way to stay in Boston,close to transportation and a lovely neighborhood to walk around in. It snowed the night we were here and everything looked postcard. Have breakfast at the Gondres Bakery,one block away. Good coffee,delicious dense square of sweet cornbread. We'll be back!

I had never been to Boston before, but Molly's place was very easy to find and access via public transport. It was also in a great location that made it easy to access all of Boston's attractions."

The place was adorable and cozy, decorated with drawings and picture of her adorable children. Everything was set up for us before we got there (towels, notes where everything was/how everything worked, a binder full of suggestions around Boston, etc.). The location was amazing; away from the hustle and bustle of the city center but close enough that we had zero issues roaming around Boston. Would definitely try and stay there again next time we're in town!!!"
2798787,73860185,2016-05-10,47123416,Lucie,"Molly was very friendly and very helpful ! She let us check in, in the morning and let us some notes in the house to explain how everything works.

I had everything I needed, wonderful bed, heater or fan if needed, personal bathroom, lovely kitchen!  I was able to make breakfast for myself each day and Molly left delicious coffee for me as well!  I felt so much at home and I really loved being in Jamaica Plain.

This was our first real Airbnb experience and we would highly recommend anyone to stay with Molly if you are considering visiting JP and/or Boston. It only takes 15 minutes on the T. Room and house is exactly as described.
2798787,80470476,2016-06-18,66457902,Adie,"Molly's room was perfect for our trip to Boston. It was very clean and spacious, the bathroom was next door and there were fresh towels to use throughout our stay. The decoration was beautiful and it is just as the pictures show. The only down side was that the blinds let in a lot of light but we managed to get by okay."
Jamaica Plain is a very interesting area too. Molly's house is situated in a quiet and quaint residential street but very close to public transport,restaurants and all other amenities. The centre of Boston is a very short train ride away and I would certainly recommend taking a trip to Jamaica Pond which is about a 15 minute walk away.,,,,
Also,Molly is a great host! She has the 2 cutest kids and welcomed us into her home with open arms. She was always there if we needed anything,extremely accommodating and let us get on with our business with no issues whatsoever.,,,

2798787,87527165,2016-07-20,83129745,Russ,The accommodations and host were perfect. Molly made us feel like family. My daughter and I were able to sightsee in Boston and catch the Red Sox while having home base at Molly's and it couldn't have gone better.

We had a very warm welcoming from a friend of the family who made sure we knew our way around and even gave us parking tips which can be difficult in the South End.  The property was clean, comfortable and had beautiful light.  The neighborhood was perfect for walking around to shop and eat.  The proximity to the MFA and other museums was a plus.  Our host checked in with me via text throughout the stay to make sure we did not need anything.  We would stay here again and recommend the property to friends."

1472481,7225067,2013-09-11,2831015,Hal,"My stay with the Carney family was exactly what I had anticipated. They have a lovely house in an attractive area near the water. The room was comfortable and pleasant. The house is outside of the downtown Boston area, but only a few stops on the subway."
The Carneys were lovely hosts,providing fruit and muffins for breakfast and even a bathrobe and slippers.,,,,
My travelling companion and I didn't get a chance to spend much time at the house--arriving late and leaving early both days--so we missed out on some of the charm of the neighborhood and a chance to spend more time getting to know our hosts. Even so,I enjoyed my stay,and I would certainly recommend a stay with the Carneys the next time you are travelling to Boston.,,,
"\"",,,,,
1472481,7372012,2013-09-17,8265288,John,"I enjoyed my stay with the Carney's very much. I stayed on the 3rd floor. It was very clean, freshly painted with newly installed central air, great because my 2nd day was 95 deg. There are two brand new beautiful bathrooms with showers on this floor also. I liked that the lights come on as you get near them. So did my 12 year old daughter when she had to get up in the middle of the night. Barney made delicious muffins for breakfast and delicious coffee. There is also a small fridge next to the room with yogurt, juice, and fruit. A couple of mornings my daughter and I made eggs in the first floor kitchen (very clean and spacious) then sat out on the adjacent deck and enjoyed the beautiful relaxing view. I also appreciated the advice about the city and talks I had with Mary and Barney. If you're looking to relax, meditate, or be by yourself, it's easy to do here too. For me it is a home away from home. This was my first visit to Boston. The house is in this lovely neighborhood of Savin Hill. It was a five minute walk for me to the T station. I got a 7 day pass and quickly learned the Boston Transit system. I rented a car, but didn't use it for my trips into town."
"I have only positive memories from my stay with the Carney's. I will definitely stay there again on my next visit!\"",,,,,

Thank you for this wonderful stay!"
1472481,7446662,2013-09-20,8784897,Kevyn,Carney family was very accommodating.
Room was definitely worth the price.  Only complaint was the room pictured was not the room we received - would have preferred a queen bed vs two twins.  But I should have specified!,,,,,
Bathroom was gorgeous,obviously newly renovated.,,,,
Not a lot around the home but it was very easy to get  to the train into the city.  Felt safe walking home from train at night.,,,,,

Although we were initially surprised that our room had three single beds we all slept well as the beds were comfortable.  The guest rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. Barney's coffee was excellent! We were not disappointed by Barney's famous muffins as raved about by previous guests. Most of our contact with Mary was on the phone. I found her to be friendly, warm and helpful. Another great feature of staying here was the 5 minute walk to the T (red line). We were able to leave our car at the house and had a pleasant excursion in to Boston. We would recommend staying here if visiting the Boston area. Thanks Barney and Mary!"
1472481,7811814,2013-10-04,7621104,Richard,"What a find!  I was working in Boston for four days reviewing Cristo Rey Boston High School for regional accrediting agency.  I lucked onto the Carney's place through AirBnB (first time for me) and had a thoroughly enjoyable stay.  I woke up to fresh baked muffins, fresh brewed coffee, fruit and juice each morning.  One night while waiting to be picked up I sat on one of the two porch swings with Barney Carney and learned of the history of his family in Dorchester.  I could walk to my school each day, have a great breakfast at McKenna's and an exquisite dinner at Savin Bar and Grill.  If I had wanted to take the T is was an easy walk from the house.  Great find, will be staying again, if they will have me!"
1472481,7943743,2013-10-09,6607217,Betty,The rooms are very clean.There were muffins and hot coffee ready every morning. We enjoyed our pleasant walk to the Savin Hill subway station every morning. I will be lo going for the Belgian waffle at McKenna's.  We had a great time in Boston. Highly recommend this place.

Even though the house is old the Carney's have maintained it well, as well as renovated the rooms and restrooms to modern standards while maintaining a historic charm. The rooms were very neat, clean, and comfortable. The shared bathroom facilities are nice. There are two complete bathrooms with showers serving 3 rooms so there was never any interference among guests. Coffee, fruit, oatmeal, and muffins were available every morning. Also, there is a great breakfast restaurant within walking distance called McKenna's. The transit station is a little closer than McKenna's. Getting around Boston from the Carney house was easy. I highly recommend the Carney's house for your next visit to Boston. David (my stay - Nov 4 - 9)"

Il y a 2 salles de bains donc ce n'est jamais encombré. Pour finir, le petit dej est très complet avec des choses pour tous les gouts!

The neighbourhood is nice,full of big houses like this one and only a short walk from the train to downtime (a really short ride away,around 10-15 mins).

1472481,9427823,2013-12-28,6026376,Yohan,Hi all!
It was a real pleasure to stay at the carney's family's place. They are really kind people who take good care of you during your whole stay.,,,,,
Their place is amazing and very convenient,only 6 minutes far from the subway station!,,,,
I highly recommend these hosts!,,,,,

The room is beautiful and lovely, just as the whole house. Beds are extremely comfortable and Mary and Barney will make sure your stay is perfect. Hot coffee and fresh muffins in the morning, towels and soft bathrobes, umbrella's for when it rains, tips for where to go in Boston and even a lift to the station. They are really the perfect hosts and I will recommend everybody to stay at their lovely house!"
1472481,9742088,2014-01-07,10457913,Jianxin,It's such great experience staying here and would definitely recommend to anyone considering.
1472481,10069906,2014-01-28,11110755,Peter,"Staying with the Carney family was a pleasure. Their house is extremely nice as is the room I stayed in. There were plenty of comforts to be had, such as breakfast things in the morning, and everyone was friendly and helpful. I'd definitely recommend staying here,"
1472481,11526307,2014-04-06,253716,Philip,"The Carney Family are wonderful salt of the earth Boston folk. I was visiting with my son to see colleges in the area. They communicated quickly and well with the whole family getting involved in making sure we had all the info we needed. It is a little ways out of Boston proper but easy to get to and the subway is very efficient. They have a charming simple house but from the moment we walked in the door it felt comfortable and as though it were our house we were coming home to. They have totally dialed in the airbnb experience having remodeled the bathrooms which are clean, tastefully done and allow privacy while maximizing the efficiency of having multiple people share; bathrooms are so important! The room was simple but had wonderfully unique touches that gave it personality. Mary and Barney are both gracious hosts and we had some great conversations. Barney was even kind enough to give us a ride to the airport. The Carney Family are excellent hosts and I would highly recommend them to anyone staying in the Boston area."
1472481,11679758,2014-04-12,10168994,Audrey,Thank you very much!!
The room was great,the bathrooms (2) are wonderful (and really good quality towels)!,,,,
Great surprise with the little special room with a refrigerator,microwave and food for breakfast! So kind!!!,,,,

1472481,12109067,2014-04-23,8259761,Nancy,"We really enjoyed our stay with the Carney Family.  We loved the neighborhood, Savin Hill, the homes were beautiful and the people seemed very close knit.  The room was bright and clean.  Bathrooms were well appointed as well.  The fresh coffee and muffins each morning were icing on the cake."
1472481,12244071,2014-04-27,5275226,Barbara,"My son Phillip (16) and me had a lovely time in Barney and Mary's house. We stayed for 4 nights (after a week in New York and a few days in Provincetown). We loved our room and the house and really appreciated to be able to cook a few meals in the well equipped guest kitchen. There are lots of other spaces guests are allowed to use and we enjoyed relaxing, reading and planning our next day in the shared breakfast area on the toop floor. Mary and Barney were also very helpful and clearly enjoy having visitors from all over the workd in their house."
Neighborhoood is lovely too only 4 stops from the main station,very accessible.,,,,

1472481,12396658,2014-05-01,12618053,Marie-Eve,Me and my mother spent two nights at 'Hotel Carney' and we were delighted by our time there. The house is in a very quiet and beautiful neighbourhood and ideally located to go to downtown Boston. The bedroom was lovely and Barney's muffins for breakfast are absolutely delicious. I definitely recommend this place.
1472481,12490951,2014-05-04,5253353,Sarah,"\"My stay with the Carney Family was wonderful. It was great to have a \"\"home\"\" to come back to and everything was as described and shown in the pictures. I was there for a conference in Boston and the proximity to the subway made it easy to get to center city. It was also nice to see other travelers staying at the Carney's"
1472481,12712441,2014-05-09,12247763,Dmitry,"A pleasure to stay in, this large house is a short walk from the station and had everything we needed for a three day stay. The Carney family were universally helpful and very nice to two tired Australians far from home."
1472481,12769570,2014-05-10,14986451,Victoria,"Mary and Barney were great hosts even though I didn't have a chance to actually talk to Mary… however, my mon had a very good communication with Barney while he was making next day's muffins, and Barney was so nice and patient to all my mom's curiosity. Overall, this is a great place to stay!"
1472481,12946445,2014-05-15,2207593,Chandra,"Great location, great communication, and great coffee! Hands down the most beautiful bathrooms I have ever seen in a private residence."
1472481,13102047,2014-05-19,9218905,Neil,"Barney and Mary were fantastic hosts - they have established a very comfortable and beautiful Airbnb experience, probably one of the best ones i've had.  This is actually a true Airbnb in my view, in the sense that they provide more than adequate supplies (towels, toiletries, etc...) and offer muffins, coffee, OJ in the morning."
The place itself is huge,as you can probably tell from the description.  You do have to walk up to the third floor,which may be an issue for some.  But if you can get over that,you will find the experience very good especially relative to the price (in my opinion).   Its not too far from the T station - so a relatively easy walk to convenient public transportation.,,
When/if in Boston,"I would definitely look up Barney and Mary - thanks again for your hospitality!\"",,,,

Healthy snacks and drinks were available which came in handy early in the morning!  I highly recommend staying here, it is close to everything and easy access to where ever you want to go.  Beautiful home in a great neighborhood! It will be unlikely to match this experience.  Everything was perfect!"
1472481,13316945,2014-05-25,14686416,Silvia,I had to stay in Boston only for 2 days and I think I couldn't get a better place! The room was very confortable and I had all what I needed. Bathroom was great!

1472481,13750897,2014-06-03,14952551,Zihsian,Nice stay at Carney's family. The bedroom was clean and comfortable. Mary and Barney were friendly and gave us some suggestions for nearby restaurant. We really enjoyed Indian food at Shanti. Thank you so much!
1472481,14008800,2014-06-10,10995734,Marchelle,"Our stay with the Carney Family was everything you could hope for. This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were not disappointed. Our accommodation was immaculate and very comfortable. It felt like we were staying with family friends. The Carneys could not do enough for us. The transport in and out of Boston was very straight forward and not long. We were about a 20 min walk to the supermarket so we were able to buy what we needed for dinner and take what we needed from the house down to the Bay Area to have picnic dinners. We really appreciated the fresh fruit and fresh coffee each morning. I was worried about sharing a floor and bathroom with other guests, but we passed about twice in the hall and never had to wait for a bathroom. Don't listen to anything that says Dorchester is not a safe area, it was a beautiful area filled with beautiful old homes that were all beautifully kept. I would love to be able to stay with the Carney family again. Thank you Barney and Mary."
1472481,14321758,2014-06-16,16568598,Will,"Clean, quiet, beautiful neighborhood, close to colleges, really nice bathrooms. Host was very accommodating."

1472481,14547474,2014-06-22,1774481,Kathleen,"My partner and our sixteen-year-old daughter had a magnificent stay at the Carney's Harbor View.  Fabulous location, spotless bathrooms, a welcoming home with lots of space for socializing, privacy for sleeping, as well as fresh coffee and muffins in the morning. All aspects were beyond expectation and delightful hosts to boot make this AirBnB a top experience.  I know we will tell everyone we know going to Boston that this is the place to stay!"
1472481,14898591,2014-06-29,10302112,Andrew,The Carney family were very pleasant people to stay with and very helpful with advice for trips around Boston. The room was very spacious and clean with beautiful views.  The house was very close to red line. All in all a great place to stay.
1472481,15095686,2014-07-02,6169664,Gala,"Carney family are great hosts, i was falling late upon arrival but the check in went really smooth. I booked on airbnb because i failed to book a hotel for reasonable price and i don't regret it, since i saw not only touristic part of the city but a true Boston neighborhood where people actually live. The house itself is like a museum, there's a lot of antique artefacts and a unique atmosphere there. Bathrooms are just amazing, tastefully renovated and pristine clean. Muffins, fruits, yogourt and coffee for breakfast are just a fabulous extra to an overall great experience. The terrace is beautiful, we spent a nice evening there.The place is a walking distance from a metro station which makes it easy to get downtown where all the tourist attractions are. There's a piano in the house and sometimes Barney plays and sings, and it was a pleasure to listen to. Mary and Barney are nice and helpful, they are there for you if you need them. They even have bathrobes, which i find thoughtful and touching. Totally recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Boston."
1472481,15394036,2014-07-08,14099420,Ludwik,John and Robert's Harbor view was in a nice neighborhood a walkable distance from the subway.  The CarneyFamily were respectable hosts who made us feel welcome and let us be at ease.
I was traveling with a friend and our major concern is that we would be stuck to a curfew being in someone's house and that was not the case with the CarneyFamily.,,,,,
Me and my friend were able to come and go as we pleased and were not micromanaged or bothered during our stay.  When we would need to ask about something the CarneyFamily were helpful in looking materials up and providing us information.,,,,,
You cannot beat the price for a room that is nearby the major transit system and is only a few stops from the historical downtown area.,,,,,
I highly recommend staying here should you be looking for a place in the region to rest your head at.,,,,,

This is easily one of the best Airbnb - no,one of the best BnB,hotel,motel etc experiences I have had in my life. They Carney family has done a great job making their home inviting for guests. Private but not shunned - clean but not robotic.,,

1472481,18927373,2014-09-02,20260983,Ben,The Carney family were very welcoming and helpful when we first arrived at their very nice and well kept home. If I visit the Boston area again I would definitely stay here again for both their hospitality and very easy access to get into the city.

We didn't spend much time there, but I did enjoy it and had the opportunity to walk around the neighbourhood a bit in the morning, it's a nice place. I'll probably stay there the next time I visit Boston."
1472481,19189513,2014-09-08,15727617,S,Barney was really friendly and the entire family provided excellent detailed instructions to find their residence clearly. Barney was very pleasant and provided great suggestions for the  day. It was an interesting experience to stay without the use of keys. The room looked like the picture and it was very clean. Thank you!
1472481,19326950,2014-09-10,5665501,Nadja,"\"This was the best airbnb experience I've had so far! Mary and Barney are great hosts. I had the impression they're not just doing this for the money but also because they really enjoy having their house full of guests. The room and the bathrooms were clean and look exactly as on the pictures. In the breakfast area you can always find some fresh fruit, yogurts, cereals, tea etc and Barney's muffins in the morning are delicious. You can also use the fully equipped kitchen downstairs or sit on the porch and read a book or just enjoy the beautiful view from there (by the way: the room is called \"\"harbor view\"\" with good cause...). It's just a few minutes to walk to the subway station (red line) and it doesn't take long to go downtown. There's also a supermarket close by that has really good ready-made food. So"
1472481,19367940,2014-09-11,6120711,Sarah & Ruben,"Mrs. Carney called and let us know how to get in. We got in late, but we still wanted to grab dinner in Boston. She was very nice and didn't seem like it was a hassle for us to be arriving past 10pm. The room was adorable and clean, and the bathrooms were awesome. The neighborhood had some beautiful houses and there was easy parking in front. It was very easy for us to take the train in to downtown Boston the next morning."

Overall,this property is ideal for a stay in Boston. It is a 5 minute walk to the nearest 'T' stop (Savin Hill) and,for those of you keen on exercise and outdoors activities,there is a stunning walk all along the coast at the back of the house. After 1.5 miles you come to the JFK Presidential Museum (well worth a visit) and get one of the best panoramic views of Boston that I saw during my time there.,,

1472481,21281149,2014-10-14,398856,Maria,"I hardly know where to start.  Our experience as guests in this beautiful and charming house was fantastic from top to bottom.  First of all, Mary's directions were thorough and spot-on.  Secondly, my friend and I practically squealed with delight when we stepped inside our room because it was so cute and we felt like were sleeping in an American Girl doll house.  Thirdly, the top floor area (where there are other rooms that they list) is so well appointed, with spacious and immaculate bathrooms and a nice cozy little breakfast nook where fresh warm muffins and hot coffee were waiting for us every morning (among other things in the mini-fridge).  I didn't even get around to exploring the kitchen and living area for the guests until the second day, which were really quite lovely.  I curled up with a book on the couch there for a good hour, and had we spent more days in the area, we probably would have made good use of the full kitchen as well.  What I liked most about staying at the Carney Family house was that it really was like staying in someone's home, what with family photos and art everywhere you turned.  My friend and I both had a chance to chat a bit with Mary and Barney about the area and the house, and they were very friendly and we felt quite welcome.  Also, it was a pretty convenient walk from the Savin Hill T station the Red Line.  Not an extremely short one, but definitely doable in 6 or 7  minutes.  Something you might need to consider if you have a lot of luggage, though.  I would not only recommend any room in the Carney Family house to Boston visitors, but I myself cannot wait to come back and stay here again!"
1472481,21414061,2014-10-17,15727274,Roger,"When we arrived, the host was not there and apparently had forgotten to send is an email explaining what we should do. Eventually we contacted her by phone and let ourselves into our room."
The room was very comfortable and cosy,even though we had to drag heavy cases up 2 flights of stairs.,,,,
Breakfast was plentiful and of a good standard.,,,,,
The house is well positioned to get into Boston by tube (Red line) and in a very pleasant and seemingly safe neighbourhood.  We also liked for dinner the Savin Bar and Kitchen opposite the tube station.,,,,,
We'd certainly recommend this place,"though we found it more like a hotel (it has 7 rooms for rent) than a family home. \"",,,,

The few times we bumped into Barney, Mary and Andrew they were all so polite and welcoming and easy to talk to. The rooms were beautiful and the views from the bathroom were phenomenal looking out over the harbour and beach. A Breakfast of fresh homemade muffins, granola, porridge and fruit were provided daily and tasted great! Well located a 7 minute walk from the T station (red line) the entire city of Boston was easily accessible. I honestly could not fault anything with my stay. It was 10/10!"
1472481,22403606,2014-11-05,21766789,Cielo,"It was an amazing first time Airbnb experience. The house was gorgeous and very warm and cozy. Barney and Mary were such great helpful hosts. They helped us with directions into the city and extra things to do in Boston that we didn't know about. A continental breakfast was included and it was better then any other continental breakfast I've had, Barney's muffins were great you gotta have those.

1472481,25580906,2015-01-19,15932881,Henri,"This is the place to spend a few nights (or days) when in the Boston area. A charming mansion, warmly welcomg hosts, enough room for privacy and access to the house amenities. We stayed 3 days and nights with the Carney family and will keep a fond memory of our stay here. The hosts are lively, and they can provide fascinating,mthoughtful comments and discussion. If one is more the private type, the rooms are rather large, quite comfortable, good jatural light and agreeable views on the water. There is an adjoining little and comfortable salon with plenty of coffee, tea, juice and muffins. The bathrooms were simply impeccable. It is clear that"
"much effort is spent making guests feel as comfortable as possible. We loved it. And we'll certainly hack here if in Boston again.\"",,,,,
1472481,26197704,2015-02-06,18607361,Frank (And Meridith),"Returning to my first AirBnb host, I now have the experience to know that the Carney Family is the unusual combination of professional, low key (meaning you can arrive late at night, if needed, and keep to yourself if you wish), yet this is a personal space and the hosts are personable."
Only downside is the Boston snow,which makes the Dorchester streets difficult to navigate.  That said,if you are anthropologically inclined,"you can observe the spontaneous behavior of \"\"dibs\"\"--using chairs (and a surprising variety of other objects) to mark parking spots the locals have dug out. Lockean property at its finest.\"",,

1472481,27001410,2015-02-23,26848929,Heidi,My new home away from him!
My sisters and I stayed with the Carneys for ten days.,,,,,
This was my first Airbnb stay. And I have to say I don't know if it can ever be topped! The Carneys were so gracious and lovely. I honestly felt as though I were home. From them offering us a ride to work after the blizzard,to delivering hot muffins right out of the oven to our bedroom.,,,,
Words cannot express how phenomenal a stay we had.,,,,,
I would highly highly reccomend this place to anyone in Boston.,,,,,
"And I will return here from now on when I am in town.\"",,,,,
1472481,27272208,2015-03-01,5437436,Aj,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Carney house. The hosts are very hospitable. The location is conveniently close to the red line of the T train. Delicious, freshly baked muffins were always made for breakfast, accompanied by coffee.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who visits Boston!"
1472481,28076400,2015-03-17,10341225,Shannon,"This was one of the the best vacations I have ever had. Going to Boston for St Patrick's day was a bucket list item for myself and my college age son. Staying at the Carney's made it what it was! First, they were so flexible and helpful when our trip had to be shortened and flights canceled due to the snow storm that hit the airport we were to fly into, and they graciously adjusted our room times. Second, we arrived after midnight, but their wonderful son greeted us and made us feel welcomed. Thirdly, this is the most beautiful house in the best location you could imagine. It is like something from a storybook or bygone era, a mansion perfectly sitting on top of a hill over the ocean, and very safe and conveniently located. Yet, the accommodations were modern and comfortable. You can take a giant hot tub soak, have all the plush towels, hair dryers, amenities you need, as well as constant gourmet coffee and teas and homemade healthy granola, muffins, english muffins and fruit. The beds are comfortable and even though we were there during snow and ice the duvets are warm. We didn't get to use the back porch and beach as it was very cold and wintery, but it was still a great place to be. In the summer I imagine it is even more amazing. The family and other guests are all welcoming and very good people. We were even treated to baby grand piano playing and beautiful singing by their college age children while there, and it added so much. My own son was able to play the piano, in this giant window with snow falling behind, and it was just all around a trip that gave us so many memories. I was a little scared beforehand because some people have said Dorchester can be a violent area, but this is definitely in the high end, where you can walk the neighborhood with no worries, and there is a great local cafe, McKenna's, that had the best food ever. You are close to the t station, but we used uber easily too for not expensive convenience. The downstairs living room and kitchen make you feel you rented an entire house. We loved it and we will be back. It was so comforting it was almost hard to get out to see Boston! So we left the vacation feeling refreshed like we'd been to a spa/resort too. I took many photos of the ocean outside our window.  The only thing that was hard, was leaving! I am already planning when I can go back!"
1472481,28498351,2015-03-24,20602722,Pat,Great! Loved the attention to details. There is everything you need and more.  5 star B&B stay.
1472481,28905399,2015-03-31,29514385,Louise,Je recommande vivement un séjour dans la famille Carney.
Pour une premier expérience en air bnb,ce fut plus que réussi. La maison est très accueillante,tout est fait pour que vous vous sentiez comme chez vous.  Les salles de bains sont spacieuses,tout es fourni ( literie,serviettes,gel douche ...) le petit déjeuner est compris et les muffins de Mary sont un vrai régal.
La famille Carney est adorable et est toujours disponible si vous avez besoin d'aide.,,,,,
La station de metro Savin Hill est a moins de 10 min de marche et le centre de boston est tres facilement accessible.,,,,,
Si vous avez de la chance vous aurez  même le droit a un concert privé de piano et de chant.,,,,,
Bref,n’hésitez pas a prendre une chambre chez eux. c'est un vrai bonheur.,,,,

1472481,29238283,2015-04-05,10743221,Maria,I enjoyed my stay at Carneys! I've met  Mr Carney only on my last day. She is a wonderful lady who does make everything feel like home: from fresh flowers to freshly baked muffins in the mng-:)
Their place is located about 5-8min walk from train station,however the area itself is a bit removed from the center. So Id say before you plan you trip familiarize yourself with Boston neighborhoods a bit better so you won't have to spend time on the train. T system is nice but kind is slow.,,,,

1472481,30649307,2015-04-25,3468109,Matt & Laura,The Carney family's house is a beautiful period house in a characterful area of Boston. The room was perfect: wooden floorboards and rugs as well as some nice period furniture that gave the room a homely feel. A real slice if 1900s Americana - but with all mod cons! The location is great for popping in and out of the city centre as well as for getting to the airport. Would definitely stay again if in town.
1472481,30767275,2015-04-27,9905472,Isabelle,"We have wonderful holidays at Carney Family'home (3 days). The room is clean and pretty, the bathrooms are splendid, the breakfast great. The home is very close to de subway station who is 15-20 minutes far from downtown and south station, it was perfect.  Everybody was nice with us: we recommend this bedroom."

1472481,31090854,2015-05-02,23684631,Hey-Jin,I stayed here for 5 nights while attending a conference and it felt like home away from home.  The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was spick and span.  Barney gave me great directions to the house from the airport and the subway is 5 to 7 minutes walk from the house and just a few stops away from downtown.  It was real nice and convenient to have a breakfast nook on the third level.  I would definitely stay here again.

1472481,36966971,2015-07-03,28410816,Lori,"Overall, I had a good experience.  The room was clean as was the bath.  I will pay closer attention next time I review a potential stay with AirBNB as I missed the fact that the bathroom was separate and shared.  I believe when I entered my search criteria that I stipulated a private, in room, bath.  Will certainly be more careful next time.  The hosts, Barney and Mary, were pleasant during the brief interactions I had with them.   The 2 flights of stairs were a bit of an inconvenience with 2 pieces of luggage. While I would say that this room met basic needs and was clean, it definitely lacked the amenities that one would find in a B&B or a hotel."
1472481,37157862,2015-07-05,31909930,Mikaela,Such a beautiful house!!! And Mr.Barney is super nice!!! The area where the house at is pretty quiet and the T(subway) is not far from the house. The bedroom and the bathroom are really clean and tidy!!

First class hospitality and organisation from Mary and Barney.  spacious and comfortable bedrooms, easy access to the house. Some noise from the nearby motorway at night if you are sleeping with open windows, but small price to pay for staying in such a lovely place. For the pianists among us, there is a good baby grand on the first floor, kept in tune and on open access. Very enjoyable experience all considered."

The room that we stayed in was very spacious and clean for the 3 of us who were visiting. The beds were comfortable and we were supplied with bathrobes and slippers- what a nice touch! On the third floor where we stayed, there are 2 full bathrooms and we never had to wait to use them. Barney makes the most delicious muffins and Mary's granola with yogurt is just as tasty! Their home is located just a short walk to the T, making it easy to get around without a car. We can't thank you enough for opening your home to us and providing such great hospitality and accommodations. We will definitely be back again to visit and will recommend your home to all of our friends and family who are looking to visit Boston."

We had granola, tea, coffee, yogurt, orange juice but the best thing was the handmade muffin. We had the breakfast in a beautiful terrace at the first floor with a beautiful view of the garden.

1472481,51129501,2015-10-18,36659525,Jean,My friend and I loved staying at the Carney house! They gave us good advice about touring around town. We looked forward to the coffee and delicious homemade muffins each morning! We will go back whenever we visit Boston again.
1472481,51558070,2015-10-21,45180937,Shang-Hsi,"The room is bright and spacious, and there is a closet to put our baggage and hang our jackets. The bathrooms are always clean and you are never lack of towel. At mini-bar, they offer the muffin and coffee which are very delicious. Barney and Mary are very nice and easy going persons. It was a wonderful experience of BnB. Hope we can stay the lovely house again when visiting Boston next time."
1472481,51669090,2015-10-22,46482986,Lance,"\"Easy walk from the subway station.  Quaint old Boston suburb and a short walk to the bay via the neighboring short street.  Beautiful old Victorian but very well kept, especially the bathrooms.  Room was just as pictured - bright and inviting.  Plenty of space for my 17-yo son and I.  Very well furnished with interesting furniture including a small rolltop desk.  Lots of nice touches - luxurious towels, chocolates, nice lounge area with food and drink.  Hosts were very warm, welcoming, and very much \"\"pro\"\" at hosting.  This is as good as any regular B&B I've stayed at"
1472481,51710960,2015-10-24,32561858,Donna,"\"My only regret was that we didn't have longer here! I loved this old house and having the pleasure of staying in \"\"real\"\" Boston was one  of the highlights of our US trip. I'd take this over a sterile hotel room any day. Location was absolutely perfect"
1472481,51759563,2015-10-24,27943742,Ros,"Ours was a brief overnight stay but we felt very at home in this lovely house and our room had everything we needed. The bathrooms, though not ensuite, are spacious and luxurious and there was never a problem finding one empty. We left too early for breakfast but Barney did offer us muffins on our way out of the door for the airport - much appreciated. The neighbourhood felt very safe and we walked to a good restaurant for dinner. It's only 20 minutes from the airport by car and very handy for the subway. Would highly recommend and hope to come back."
1472481,52402761,2015-10-29,30057568,Gail,The accommodations were fine but the breakfast very disappointing - a muffin.

1472481,53177300,2015-11-06,43755656,Khang,"It was great time to stay in CarneyFanily House. Before our arrival, Barney sent out very clear directions on how to get to their place by T from South Station, plus directions on how to get in the house and to the room my sister and I were staying in. It took less than 20 mins to get there. Although we arrived earlier than checkin time, we could use bathroom to fresh up."
The house is absolutely beautiful,the room is very,very clean. The bathrooms that are located on the same floor as the room are very modern and very clean.,,,
The morning granola,yogurt,OJ,coffee,fruit,and tea are perfect and delicious. Specially we love muffins very much. Thank you!!!!
The location of the house is great! The walk to the metro is very pleasant and seems like a very safe neighborhood.  If I ever visit Boston again,I will definitely try and stay here again!,,,,

1472481,55958301,2015-12-07,18171369,Luis,"Absolutely amazing home, phenomenal restrooms, and great bedrooms. The ONLY downside is the lack of security. Neither the front door, the foyer door, or the bedroom doors are ever locked, and the bedrooms do not have locks from the outside to protect guest's belongings. There should definitely be locks on the bedroom doors. stayed in a similar home in Brooklyn and each room had its own set of keys for security."
1472481,56196757,2015-12-10,16112554,Yu,"We enjoyed our stay at Barney and Mary's place. The room is clean, spacious and homey. The bathroom is equipped with great shower ,metal basin and marble top.

From the the bath robes included in our room to the Barney's delicious muffins and Mary's wonderful granola, the Carney family has taken every step to make guests feel at home here. To top it off, the house is just a short walk from the T station. The neighborhood feels very safe and is incredibly well lit! I recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to stay in the Boston area!"

1472481,64302831,2016-03-02,55799352,Guillaume,Un très bon endroit situé pas loin de Boston. La chambre est agréable. La maison est grande et bien aménagé pour le Airbnb. Les chambres et les 2 salles de bains ont surement été rénové il n'y a pas longtemps donc tout est vraiment très propre. Le petit déjeuner est vraiment top avec des muffins maison le matin!
Le métro est à 10 min même pas à pied donc c'est parfait pour aller visiter Boston.,,,,,
"Je recommande sans hésitation!\"",,,,,
1472481,64689687,2016-03-06,18139593,Destiny,It is a great place to relax and the view of the river is definitely good in Boston. The facilities are excellent of this b&b although the sound created by the person lived next door is a little bit annoying. It is a little bit far from the center of Boston but a good place to enjoy your life as a local at Boston. I would recommend this place!
1472481,64861180,2016-03-08,58794735,Heejin,"Even though I and my friend stayed only for one night, we felt like our host family took care of us in many ways and we stayed in their house with cozy experience. We would like to use their house again for our next travel in Boston."
1472481,65390766,2016-03-13,60412735,Simian,"The house is gorgeous, and we have an amazing ocean view at third floor.

1472481,66282506,2016-03-20,62795763,Murhaf,"You know how you look at images of food in commercials and it rarely ever pans out like the picture? This room was the complete opposite. Everything was as described, I'd even go as far as to say it looks better in person than in the photos."
Mary and Barney made me and my roommate who I was travelling with feel very welcome before we even set a foot in the house,having agreed to changed our reservation a day before our arrival due to certain complications we ran into.,,,,
The house is absolutely gorgeous and the stay was fantastic. Oh,"and Barney's muffins are as good as advertised. \"",,,,

We thank them for welcoming us. And we had a very good breakfast each morning !"
"Definitely a very good stay.\"",,,,,
1472481,68297113,2016-04-04,22331118,Kathy,"First of all, the information we received from Barney previous to our stay was great. We knew exactly where to park and the procedures for  finding our room. Although we did not meet Barney or Mary, we had a pleasant conversation with 3 of their children. The 3rd floor where we stayed was extremely clean and quiet. My daughter loved the soft sheets and warm comforters, while my granddaughter cozied up on the comfortable cot that was added for her. My favorite was the warm homemade muffins that greeted us in the morning. Definitely a must stay when visiting Boston. Thank you Carney Family!"
1472481,68745441,2016-04-06,14524850,Kavee,"This place was gorgeous and in a great location. Everything was cute especially the decorations. My favorite thing about this place is the tea corner which I could have a cup of tea, and enjoy a beautiful view outside the window at the same time. Such a peaceful corner. Love this place. I really want to stay here again if I had another chance to visit Boston."

Moreover,"Barney's muffins were delicious!\"",,,,
1472481,69899406,2016-04-14,42277980,Annetta,"The accommodation is comfortable and well maintained . In the attic a little corner for breakfast is provided . Coffee, hot water for tea, rolls, Mamelade are always available - our favorite place in the house.  The comfort corresponds to a small hotel. We felt very welcome."
1472481,70685192,2016-04-19,28649282,Rod,"\"We had just a fantastic time at Barney and Mary's airbnb.  I had made the reservations for 4 different rooms for us and 3 other groups who were part of our running team.  One of the folks in the group was running the Boston marathon and this was a great location from which to get into Boston or other areas for sight-seeing.  And, Barney was most gracious and took our marathoner into Boston Monday morning so he could get the bus to the Marathon start without having to depend on the T.  I woke every morning to the pleasant aroma of Barney's freshly baked muffins.  There was plenty of \"\"common\"\" room for our group to gather in either the living room or the kitchen.  And"

1472481,71644858,2016-04-27,12565208,Schalk,"Simply perfect. We would definitely stay here again, if ever in Boston. We would even consider travelling to Boston purely to stay with the Carney's again (all the way from South Africa). We stayed 3 nights and it wasn't enough. The house is wonderful, professionally cleaned, magnificently appointed and in a great location with views of the ocean and harbour."
1472481,73922970,2016-05-11,12096536,Marie,I am becoming such a regular at the Carney's. Wouldn't think of staying anywhere else
1472481,74394383,2016-05-15,19011472,Jordan,"We had a great stay! The house is old and charming, in a great area and not far from the T. The housekeepers are great, as are Mary and Barney who are always happy to help but aren't in your business. The breakfast nook and kitchen area were always well stocked with great muffins, granola, coffee, and tea. The bathrooms and shared spaces were always kept very clean. It was a bit unusual to stay somewhere without individual locks on the bedroom doors, but a safe is provided for valuables, and we still felt very safe and comfortable regardless. Don't forget to head out to the back porch or down to the park by the water for a peaceful morning cup of coffee- it's a a must! We would love to stay here again!"
1472481,75545594,2016-05-22,28165326,Cess,"This was simply the best airbnb experience I've had so far. The house was beautiful and our room and the bathrooms were just as they were shown in the photos: bright, airy, and very clean. We loved the muffins that were available at any time of the day, along with the coffee, tea, fruits, granola and yoghurt."
Barney himself was an excellent host. He met us as we arrived and took the time to show us everything and tell us about the area and places we could visit. I also really appreciated his detailed messages to us prior to our trip as his instructions on how to get to his place made getting there so easy and convenient for us.,,,,,
He was also very understanding about our having to cancel our last night and leaving earlier than expected. We messaged him about it only a day prior to our checking in,and he immediately made the adjustments to our booking.,,,,
The T was also very accessible and getting from the house to the city center and back was not too taxing,just a short ride both ways.,,,,
Everything was just so pleasant and easy,"and i would definitely recommend staying with them when in Boston. I already know i'm staying here for sure the next time i visit the city!\"",,,,
1472481,75591547,2016-05-22,40999353,Brian,"Excellent directions, communication and welcome upon arrival.  The location is just a ten minute walk from the subway into Boston.  Really, there is no reason to stay in Boston if you can stay here."

He also supplied some muffins, coffee, tea, milk and fruits for breakfast. We really appreciated and enjoyed it. Room and bathrooms were clean. Walking distance to subway. We will recommend the place to others."
1472481,79951223,2016-06-15,40935112,Fan,"we arrived at this very late, Mary just hold the front gate for us. Before arrival John and Barney contacted with me and provided some details and information about the room which is quite useful cause this the very first time for me to book a room in Airbnb it was a little bit difficult at first. But John and Barney just helped a lot~very kind of them! The room is very clean and cozy we loved it! Everything was prepared well! The bathroom is my favorite part! They got tow on the top floor. And a coffee & breakfast part at the top floor too. Mary, who met us most, had help us after the arrival. She's a very kind lady! Hope I can meet her next time!"

1472481,82671244,2016-06-28,68023932,Seth,A perfect stay! From booking to leaving in everything was so easy. All the information was sent through by Barney and the whole process was smooth. As soon as you walk into the house you feel the warmth of the family home and the room itself was perfect and has everything that you need. It's in a perfect location just a short trip to the main city itself. Barney and Mary were always on hand with any problems and queries. A must try is the muffins that are freshly baked each morning and listen to the Barney and Mary's children's cd! I would thoroughly recommend stay here and I cannot stress enough how wonderful it is. If I am ever back in Boston I know where I'll be staying!

We spent a few evenings on the front and back porch enjoying the night air and talking with Barney. It was a very safe walk to the T for two girlfriends, with streetlights on the street at night. There were a few restaurants right by the T which made it easy to get what we needed. We wish we were going back!"
1472481,84768651,2016-07-09,71952659,Sady,Had a great stay! Wonderful and beautiful house and rooms. Barney was kind enough to carry our 60 pound suitcase down the stairs for us!

L'emplacement est parfait, très beau quartier proche de la ligne rouge. La maison est splendide, Mary et Barney sont des hôtes chaleureux et attentifs. Les chambres sont très belles, les salles de bains étincelantes avec une très belle vue sur la marina. Tout est étudié dans les moindres détails pour le confort et la sérénité des voyageurs, on se sent chez soi dès le seuil passé. Une très belle cuisine où on peut se préparer son dîner quand on ne souhaite pas sortir. Et le parfum des muffins fraîchement préparés par Barney, aux saveurs différentes chaque jour suffit à vous persuader de revenir. Aucune hésitation, c'est notre maison à Boston."

Prior to my stay John gave me clear directions for getting to the house from Boston and Barney detailed how to do self check-in should no one be there when I arrived.,,,,,
Mary graciously received me upon arrival and led me to my room on the top floor. I had to climb two flights of stairs but it was well worth it for the view of the harbor from my window.,,,,,
The Carneys had everything to make my stay comfortable--a clean,impeccably decorated room with fresh linens and towels,wifi,two spotless bathrooms down the hall and a breakfast that included homemade granola and muffins in a delightful sitting room on my floor.,,

We arrived to the sound of beautiful piano music and had the pleasure of meeting some of our hosts. They pointed us to our room which was quaint and beautiful! We loved the decor of the entire house and our room, and felt spoiled by the two huge bathrooms just by our rooms.

1472481,92472878,2016-08-08,56424994,Jeong-Min,"It was a great experience! When we arrived to the house, they led us to the room and showed us around. They took care of us during the stay. It is located 10 min walk away from metro station, which is great. The house is huge, clean, and well-decorated. Breakfast is offered every morning! Highly recommended."
1472481,93293719,2016-08-12,1717946,Judith,"Sehr schönes altes Haus mit künstlerischem Flair, gleich bei einem kleinen Hafen. Offenherzig, gemütlich, ästhetisch. Die Gastgeber sind extrem freundlich (auch kinderfreundlich) und gleichzeitig unaufdringlich. 10 MInuten Fußweg zur U-Bahn. Also perfekt. Danke!"
1472481,93448643,2016-08-12,251734,Jan,"This was a lovely place and I highly recommend it.  It was very clean and in a beautiful, historic part of Boston.  The Carney family made it very easy for our arrival.  We only had one problem.  It was a very hot day when we arrived.  Our room was on a third floor.  Initially the air conditioning was on but it turned off during the night and then came back on.  We were not able to sleep during the 1-2 hours in the middle of the night when it was turned off."
1472481,94944599,2016-08-17,6276619,Colleen,Beautiful home and friendly host/family.  We will definitely stay again.

Everything was very clean, remodeled bathrooms, coffee/muffins/juice/granola/tea/etc all included. Chatted with Barney about further local suggestions, couldn't have been more friendly :)"

1472481,98469029,2016-08-31,15663003,Kathrin,"We had a perfect stay at the Carney Family's house. Everything was very conformtable and well organized. It is a very nice house with a great view and also well connected with the city center via the T line, the station is only a 10-minutes walk."
1472481,99890125,2016-09-06,68250220,Franziska,The CarneyFamily was very nice and welcoming! They gave me helpful directions to their house so I found it quickly. The rooms were clean and the neighborhood was quiet. I enjoyed the breakfast each morning and I would definitely recommend this accommodation to everybody who wants to visit Boston!

9273,341672,2011-06-28,732077,Yale,"My friend and I had decided only two weeks ago to go to Boston, and only a week ago to bring our wives. Looking at all the options available, Frank's place was the perfect location at a great price. It's a 3-story walk-up with the second and third-stories being the apartment. We were on a road trip up there from Atlanta, and were caught in a huge thunderstorm on the way. I almost thought that our reservation had been cancelled, but Frank pulled through at the last minute and allowed us to stay. If you saw the pictures of the place, they don't really do justice. The place was immaculately clean. They left us fresh towels and soap. The private parking area with gated lock was also great for leaving the car without worry. My only regret is not being able to stay longer. If you're looking for a great place that's close to Boston, the airport, that's clean, comfortable and relaxed, then definitely hit up Frank's place!"
9273,438269,2011-08-12,481632,Declan,We stayed at Frank's apartment for almost three weeks and it provided a real home from home as a central base to explore the Boston central and the greater Boston region..
The apartmernt was spacious for four of us and  nice and clean. Frank was very prefessional in his approach and attentive to any requirements we had,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9273,1219809,2012-05-02,1919090,Tooraj,Frank is a great host and he is extremely caring and generous in his offerings. We had a great time at his place.
"The place was big enough for three of us and we had a great time as we were able to work and study together and socialize. If we were at a hotel we would not have been able to have the same environment to mingle and hang out. \"",,,,,
9273,11509352,2014-04-06,12099262,Joc Cing,From David:
Highly recommended - Had a very comfortable 6 week stay for business. The apartment is in a quiet location with great views from the balconies,and it had every facility you could ask for. Frank was extremely helpful in providing assistance,even when we accidentally locked ourselves out of the apartment!,,,
From Zaiyi:,,,,,
Highly recommended – It’s a cosy and spacious apartment and we had a good time there.  The apartment is very clean (I didn’t believe in a dustless home until I see this apartment),well-organized,and well-equipped.  Frank is a very organized and efficient host,"providing clear instructions for every stage of our stay.\"",,
9273,12583433,2014-05-05,13005827,Samantha,"Frank was an absolute pleasure to work with (and very patient with me, given this was my first airbnb lease.)"
The apartment was in a great neighborhood,"easily accessible to the \"\"T\"\" and was very clean.",,,,
The directions into the space were clear and the apartment felt very safe.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9273,13663821,2014-06-02,12590192,Quyen,"Frank was really great through the entire process, from booking to the stay. He responded to emails quickly and checked in to see that everything was ok when we arrived. The house is charming, spacious, and the bedrooms on separate floors gives additional privacy if needed. Finally, it is in a convenient location for getting to the airport. If you will have a car to get around, this is a great spot to stay."
9273,38308273,2015-07-14,36232457,James,Great experience! Location was very good… My daughter and I loved it! As advertised! Frank was extremely helpful!as advertised and more!
9273,43828321,2015-08-22,29340670,Monalisa,"Frank was great at leaving detailed instructions on how to access the place, where to park, recommendations to eat, etc.  Very helpful to not have to worry about the logistics part so my family could focus on the vacation!  The view from the backyard balconies isn't captured by pictures, really a nice plus to our stay.  There were even binoculars on the shelf inside the house to use.  The kitchen was stocked with many essentials (tea, seasonings and sugars, all the cooking pans/pots) so for those who want to cook, this is a great place."
Getting out of East Boston towards downtown will cost you $3.50 each time you exit,unless you go the long way around and avoid the toll,but for the money you save on rent on this place it's totally worth it.  There aren't extensive grocery shops or cafes nearby,but there are a few cute restaurants.,,
The place was clean,nicely decorated,and very cute.  Comfortably slept two adult couples in the respective upstairs/downstairs beds,and a few kids in the upstairs living room.  :)  There was a nice park nearby that we drove by,but didn't see until our last day,but seemed like a nice place to spend an afternoon by the water.
Overall,I would definitely recommend this place if you have a car and can easily commute.  If you don't have a car,the T is a 10-15 walk away,"so not bad either.  \"",,
9273,46507065,2015-09-11,41275346,Alexa,"Frank's place was very clean and spacious. Plenty of room for 4 people and additional privacy with bedrooms on separate floors. The home matches and is even better than what is in the pictures. You can view the harbor from the balconies and the short proximity to the harborwalk was great. It is right in a residential area near a park, so it was great to interact with the locals."
Frank's response time for emails was quite reasonable,and he was easy to work with to set up my visit (as this was my first time using Airbnb). I felt a little overwhelmed by all the instructions Frank provided,"but they were very detailed and had helpful suggestions for the area. I would highly recommend staying here!\"",,,
9273,83021395,2016-06-30,66856188,Øystein,"Franks place was the perfect place to stay in Boston for our family of two adults and two kids. The apartment is cosy, was very clean and had everything we needed for our seven week stay."
We didn't have a car,but that was no problem with the bus passing just a few steps down the road taking us to the T(subway) in a few minutes,and only a few T-stops from downton Boston and transfer to all other T-lines. The bus also tok us right to and from the supermarket,which was also very convenient.,,
The apartment is close to the airport,so we was a bit worried about noise - but it was very quiet and no problem at all. Being so close to the airport was actually very convenient since it is only a 5 minute walk to the airports carrental-center and also the airport shuttlebus.,,,,
The neiborhood is also quiet and there are both nice parks,playgrounds and basketcourses in the area(perfect for relaxing or playing with the kids).,,,,
The host Frank was very friendly,and is easy to communicate with on email - always answering the same day or the next morning if we had any questions.,,,,
"So if you're planning a trip to Boston I would absolutely recommend this place!\"",,,,,
9273,93412645,2016-08-12,68753152,Sandra,"Frank was a very gracious host, always very attentive when we had questions or were in need of something. The flat is very cozy and complete for everything you might need. Conveniently located near the T station. Would definetly return."

7499960,48473004,2015-09-26,26701574,Brittany,"Suzanne was an absolutely amazing host! My Husband and I went to Boston to Celebrate our one year wedding anniversary. The apartment was a perfect size for the two of us, and in a perfect location - walk-able to everything.. I mean everything! - if you're up for the challenge :) ) if not, it is only steps away from the T. Suzanne made everything so easy on us, from accepting our AirBnB request,  to obtaining the keys, to our stay, to departure. She provided us with Local hot spots, walking tips, and even made us a wonderful pie for our anniversary! I give her communication rating 100% - which made us feel overly comfrotable. I highly recommend and we already can not wait to come back and stay!"

7499960,50685747,2015-10-13,44796015,Deena,"My husband and I came to Boston to visit our daughter. This was our first experience using Airbnb and it was nothing but positive. The studio apartment was exactly as shown in the photos by Suzanne with lovely decor, particularly the window seat. It was very clean and included amenities we had not expected by which made it even more comfortable. Such things as fresh coffee grounds and fresh towels left for us mid stay. Obtaining access to the studio was quite easy upon arrival even though we had flight delays. She was easily reachable for any questions throughout our stay. She was a great resource for transportation, restaurant and activities throughout the city. Suzanne is a very kind person and it is clear she enjoys renting her studio. She had a nice way of making herself available yet not intrusive by any means."
Our favorite part of the apartment was the location within Boston. It was central yet very quiet neighborhood and one we never felt unsafe,despite walking most of the time at various times of the day and evening.  The building is quite secure. It is situated nicely between Charles River & Boston college with a block of restaurants,shops and public transit on the other side of the university. We were able to walk down the river path to Boston commons in a reasonable amount of time. At others,we used Uber which was quite reasonable even in the early hours back to the airport.,,
"We look forward to staying again in hopes that the studio is available the next time we're in Boston. \"",,,,,

The apartment is exactly as shown in the pictures, very aesthetically decorated and extremely comfortable.  And of course, the location is beautiful-right next to the Charles river which makes for a very pleasant walk towards Cambridge over the MIT-bridge !"
7499960,64349399,2016-03-03,4482883,Jeff,The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

6014737,30845678,2015-04-27,26078708,Joe,"Carols was a very welcoming host.  This basement unit is set up a bit like a hostel, with multiple  lockable private rooms with a shared bathroom and kitchen area.  Tall people beware, there are low ceilings in places."
6014737,32305849,2015-05-16,33427401,Dustin,"We arrived on a Friday and need a place to stay. Carols gladly worked with our short notice and provided an inexpensive, but clean and nice accommodation. The rooms are hostel-like and there is a shared bathroom and kitchen area. Recommend for a nice, clean, easy and affordable stay!"
6014737,33409270,2015-05-27,17105314,Philipp,We had a pleasent stay. Everything was like in the description. Only 10 minutes to the red-line tube and additional 15 minutes to downtown.
"Thank you for being our host. \"",,,,,
6014737,34382153,2015-06-07,21110099,Peter,"My host was very responsive to my questions via email and phone. Personally welcomed me and presented me with the keys. The room was exactly as expected. Clean, comfortable, and basic. Good TV and wi-fi connection included. Public Transport via T was easy, but you need to allow 10-15 mins to walk to the station and then 15-20 mins to reach central Boston."
The house is located near the lower end of the street,so it was quiet outside at night. Inside the room you can hear other guests if they're noisy,so I'd recommend earplugs for sleeping. Overall I enjoyed a no frills,safe 2-night stay,"which is all I needed. Good value in comparison to the extremely high hotel rates all across the area during college graduation season.\"",
6014737,38355903,2015-07-14,13047068,Stéphanie,"The place was as described, great that we could use the kitchen, etc.. We didn't see much Carols but everything was fine. T station is 15 minutes far and central Boston 20-30 minutes."

6014737,46028414,2015-09-07,41774055,Jack,"This was our first Airbnb experience.  We chose Carols' listing because it provided the right combination of price, location, and accomodation. Communication from Carols was quick and responsive. She was flexible with our arrival time and check in was a very simple process. The location is just a short 10 min walk to the metro or even closer to a bus line. The heart of downtown is only about 25 minutes away. The rooms are located at the back of a residence and down towards the basement. There are a few rooms there with a small kitchenette and shared bathroom. The room itself is small but clean with nice amenities such as new sheets, ac, wifi, and TV with cable. And yes, the hallway is very green as the pics suggest. The shared bathroom was the only issue but only because one set of guests there spent a very long time (well over an hour) in it. This was not an issue after they were gone.  Access is come and go as you please. The neighborhood is charming with classic homes that are typical to the Boston and New England area. There are all types of backgrounds in the area and noticed a strong Caribbean influence. Many of the local restaurants reflected this and really added to the experience. The area feels a little more off the path than the more touristy parts of town which is what we were looking for.  We were pleased with our stay, would recommend to anyone, and would stay there again. Thanks, Carols."
6014737,46609703,2015-09-12,38737410,Kama,"Everything was fine although we did not meet Carols in person even once. She provided keys in convenient way although she was not home when we arrived, so we didn't have to wait at all. Rooms are in a basement of her house, clean, not big but if you just need a place to sleep it's very good. Shared bathroom and kitchen, without any issues. Thin walls though, you can hear all that is going on. TV in the room if you need it, wifi works just fine. No towels, you must have your own. Air conditioner in the room, which makes a difference :-) 10-15 minutes walking to T red line, another 20 to downtown by train. Thank you Carols!"
6014737,48568785,2015-09-27,40842925,Nora,"Carols hat jedes Mal innerhalb kürzester Zeit auf Nachrichten geantwortet, das war sehr angenehm. Die Unterkunft ist im Keller des Hauses, in dem die Gastgeberin wohnt. Die Zimmer sind ziemlich klein und einfach. Wenn man nur kurze Zeit bleibt, ist alles ausreichend. Leider kann nicht gut gelüftet werden. Die nächste U-Bahn-Haltestelle ist zu Fuß ungefähr 15 min entfernt."
6014737,50379986,2015-10-11,21976800,Paola,"The listing is pretty much accurate. The rooms are located in a basement with good access to a public transportation (10 mins walk to the subway). The rooms are pretty small and washroom was not that cleaned. But, hey, you get what you paid for. We had some issues getting in touch with Carols before our check-in, but everything worked out at the end. If you just want a place to sleep and don't mind to be far from downtown or the comfortability, this place would do it."
"\"",,,,,
6014737,53381518,2015-11-08,16679063,Gabriella,"Our stay was pleasant enough and Carols was a Great host! The place was basically as pictured (and yes, it is in the basement which was bit musty and grungy). Our expectations weren't too high considering the cost and location, but there were a few disappointments considering we were celebrating our anniversary. First, the bed was incredibly uncomfortable which lead to quite a bit of soreness each morning, and as two people in our early 20s, that's saying a lot.  Second, there was a good deal of blonde hair that we kept finding on our socks, on our luggage and on the hangers/clothes...Not sure where it kept coming from, but felt like the space could have been a bit cleaner."
Also,being in the basement meant lots and lots of daddy-longleg spiders. After all was said and done,"it was a decent enough place to lay our heads for four days. Thanks for your hospitality Carols!\"",,,
6014737,72916258,2016-05-05,50110759,Elodie,"We went to Carols place for one night. As we came late, we didn't met Carols directly  but it was easy to get the keys. The problem was that it was impossible to open the door because of a lock which was not supposed to be closed. At the end we had to ring and wake up the family. The bed was not confortable and the shower not really clean. But for one day and the price, it was perfect for us."
6014737,80345750,2016-06-17,16859242,Romane,"Nous n'avons jamais rencontré Carols. Les chambres louées sont au sous-sol d'une maison, ce qui implique beaucoup d'humidité, de bruit, d'insectes et de mauvaises odeurs. La cuisine, n'est pas du tout bien équipée (1 casserole et 1 poêle, pour 4 chambres potentiellement louables). La chambre est petite et peu aérée (on ne peut pas ouvrir en grand la seule et unique petite fenêtre de la chambre). La propreté et l'état général des surfaces communes sont déplorables (couloir, cuisine, salle de bain)."
Cependant,le quartier est typique de la banlieue de Boston,ce qui nous a plu. Facile d'accès au centre avec la red line qui passe à environ 10min de la maison.,,,
Cette location est notre pire séjour avec airbnb. De plus,le dernier jour de notre séjour,nous avons demandé gentiment à Carols si nous pouvions laisser nos gros sacs à dos dans la chambre ou dans la maison,pour une durée minime de 3h. Malheureusement,selon elle,nous devions payer un supplément de 20$ pour cette demande. Par principe
En conclusion,"nous trouvons que cette location va à l'encontre de l'esprit d'airbnb. VIVEMENT DECONSEILLE!\"",,,,
6014737,87616558,2016-07-21,47679700,Tiffany,"\"Nous avons réservé en avril une chambre chez Carols pour passer 4 jours à Boston. Ayant réservé en avance, j'ai envoyer un message 15 jours avant notre arrivée  via airbnb à Carols pour savoir si c'était toujours possible de nous accueillir. Message auquel je n'ai eu aucune réponse. J'ai du envoyer un message sur son téléphone personnel 2 jours avant pour savoir comment se passait l'arrivée et la remise des clés. Nous n'avons jamais rencontré Carols, nous avons été accueillis par son frère. 1er surprise la chambre est dans une cave; 2em surprise, elle est minuscule et pas très propre.  Presses de visiter Boston, nous avons posés nos bagages et nous sommes partis. A notre retour,  3em surprise il y a 3 autres \"\"chambres\"\" occupees et séparées par une cloison si fine que l'on peut entendre son voisin de chambre renifler.donc la télévision en boucle toute la nuit...  La salle de bain à partager avec les 3 autres chambres est vétuste et sale et ne donne vraiment pas envie de se laver. Nous n'avons finalement passé qu'une seule nuit sur place. Le lendemain matin j'explique le problème à la propriétaire dont la seule réponse à été de contacter airbnb pour annuler la réservation. Nous avons du attendre de plus d'une heure pour savoir où déposer les clés. Heureusement"

Though I didn't get to meet the host in person, I can tell that she is a very considerate person, for everything I need was new and in place when I arrived there. The location of the room was definitely OP. It was even closer to the T station than I had expected."
12517081,75446789,2016-05-21,22251573,Elliott,"Angie was a great host. She responded to any concerns quickly. She made sure to be in touch. The location was great for us. It wasn't right in town, but the train stop was close by and it took about 20-25 minutes once we were on the train to get to a good stop in the center of town. The house was very close to Harvard Medical. We also walked home from a Red Sox game one night. Its close enough to walk to Fenway if you want."
You do need to know the space is shared. We never saw the other roommates and barely heard them except in the morning. The room is private and has a key to lock your stuff away. Because the space is shared,the bathroom is not very clean. We were scared to shower,"which was difficult after three days. The room felt a little run down although the bed was very comfortable.\"",,,
12517081,86706236,2016-07-17,66596991,Yasser,"Angie was so responsible and accountable. The room was almost as described, and she tried to make it more pleasant by supporting and providing stuffs beyond promises. I would say one should consider the price and adjust their expectations according to it. Overall and for the price I paid, it was a good experience."

It is a newly renovated self-enclosed suite (private with own keys) that has been thoughtfully designed - he made great use of the small space! Ample, well-placed lighting, a feature-rich flat panel TV, a super comfy bed, a couch and coffee table.. felt like a modern hotel room! (with a little character provided by the bookshelf). There was even a little desk where I was able to do computer work on my laptop. It was just what I was looking for. Jonathan is a very friendly, cordial host who is open to feedback and offered me help and advice, as well as an open line of communication and much-appreciated flexibility."

The space was relatively small, but you wouldn't feel it because space was used efficiently. I liked the modern interior design."
The only thing that I was expecting was a bit more snacks. There were a few,but I think increasing the variety and number would have been appreciated more. I was able to find parking,but it could be challenging at times.,,,
Internet access was good,cable TV was good,the AC system was not noisy and you could control the temperature in the room independent of the rest of the house.,,,

4568116,25038685,2015-01-05,24156524,Annchristin,Our stay at Jonathan's apartment  was perfect. It is small but big enough to live in. It is very clean. The walk to the train station (3min) is sure fast and you need just 5min into the city. Would def stay again. Thanks :)
4568116,25247856,2015-01-10,19255720,Sreeharsha,Great place. Very responsive host.
4568116,25472433,2015-01-17,21109453,Nicole,"Jonathan was truly a wonderful host! He was kind, helpful, and accommodating even when I had to arrive very late at night! The room was clean and just as pictured. Small but comfortable and space efficient. Jonathan was available if I had questions and checked in once in a while to see if I needed anything, but I still had plenty of privacy. It is a little bit of a walk, maybe 10 min or just under, to the nearest T station but it was great for my visit to Boston. I would certainly stay here again! Thanks Jonathan!"
4568116,25607632,2015-01-20,14985107,Summer,"Jonathan is a really nice person and an excellent host. The place was very clean and well-organized, plus it has a great bed/mattress. It's a short walk to the T that takes you to downtown Boston and other neighborhoods quickly . He was also very flexible with the check-in/check out times. We will definitely try to stay at Jonathan's place next time we are in Boston."
4568116,25717188,2015-01-24,17313205,Joel,"Our stay at Jonathan's place was great. He is very friendly, and willing to give suggestions or offer help where needed. The studio itself is excellent - it's not big but has a nice layout. My wife and I had a few bags and we didn't have any problems with the space. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean - absolutely no problems. I would stay here again for sure."
4568116,26214579,2015-02-07,10681608,Dmitriy,"Jonathan's studio is very conveniently located -- only a 5 minute walk from the subway station. The studio is great: although it's a bit small, it's newly renovated and very clean. The bed is super comfortable. The studio has pretty much everything you'll need: a small couch, a folding table, a TV, a bookshelf with some books (I highly recommend the book about spying submarines). No full kitchen, but you wouldn't expect to have it in a hotel room (there's a microwave and a small fridge). My experience has been very positive. I'd love to stay there again. Jonathan is a very nice person, very accommodating, and easy to communicate with. I highly recommend this place!"
4568116,26491740,2015-02-14,20940988,Bart,"This is a great appartment: it's not big, but it feels wonderfully more spatious. I couldn't visit the city for 2 days because of very heavy snow, but I didn't feel locked up at all, rather at home. Jonathan's great service certainly helped for that. He is very kind and flexible. I much enjoyed my stay here."
4568116,27394930,2015-03-03,15927911,Brittany,"My stay at the Studio was great! I was attending an event at the Reggie Lewis Center and it was only a five minute walk down two streets! The studio had the necessities, and Jonathan was very accommodating while I was there. The place is small, but for me this is the first studio I've ever stayed in, versus a full apartment. If you have luggage, getting them in and out of the entrance can be awkward (probably because my bags were super heavy), but I made it work! I only saw Jonathan the first and last day but he asked how my event went and was super nice and helped me get my bags in and helped explain the area! I like the privacy of the place, and the private access in the back too. The bus drivers out in Boston are serious too, so if you are taking transportation be ready with a Charlie Card before you get on and know what buses to take. I did a lot of walking even with the snow. I had a great first time in Boston! I would recommend this place!"

I wish the house were slightly closer to the Roxbury Station (actually,I wish the sidewalks were less icy!),"but this place is a great value for anyone with a budget who values privacy.\"",,,
4568116,27563004,2015-03-07,22733754,Sy,"Jonathan was an awesome host and very accommodating with my crazy travel schedule. I had my own newly renovated studio apartment with everything I needed. The place is in a great neighborhood and within a few miles of everything. Jonathan is very nice, professional and an excellent communicator. We had some nice conversations on the purpose of my visit for the Zero Energy Summit on homes and buildings and his thoughts and insight on the subject and what he does.  I would love to stay there again on my next visit!:)"
4568116,27621128,2015-03-08,1113872,John,"Everything was very clean, modern, and well furnished. I liked that it has a separate entrance. Jonathan was prompt, accommodating, friendly, and communicated completely. A very fine experience."
4568116,27820419,2015-03-12,315880,Blake,"I had a great stay at Jonathan's place. It is in excellent condition, really clean, well organized and welcoming."
4568116,28210990,2015-03-20,2921573,Andrew,Jonathan's studio is conveniently located near the Roxbury Crossing T Stop making other parts of Boston easily accessible. It is an ideal temporary spot for people working at Boston Children's Hospital or any of the hospital/research facilities on Longwood (~15 minute walk). The apartment itself is cozy with all the necessary amenities for a short stay. I would recommend staying with Jonathan if you want a place to stay in South Boston.
4568116,28502252,2015-03-24,6615933,Helen,My stay at Jonathan's studio was perfect. The space is efficiently furnished and cozy! Jonathan was a great host--very responsive and friendly.

4568116,28888123,2015-03-31,26445419,Jason,Studio très propre. Exactement comme sur les images. Parfait pour une personne seule ou un couple. À quelques pas du train qui mène au centre-ville.
4568116,29076637,2015-04-03,30098045,Andrew,"Jonathan was very helpful and accommodating. His response time was fairly quick and answered all of my questions with clarity. The unit was very clean and we experienced no problems during our one night stay. However, If you don't plan on sharing the bed then be prepared to fit yourself on a smaller couch, but that was also not a big problem. Thanks again Jonathan!"

We didn't get the chance to meet him but he communicated very well and it was easy for us to get into the apartment. The private studio is small (perfect for 2 people), but very new, cozy and very clean, exactly as described. Jonathan had left maps of Boston and a metro card for us. The neighborhood itself is quiet, residential, and Roxbury subway station is less than 10 min walk from the apartment. We would definitely recommend Jonathan's studio!"

"The studio was very tidy and comfortable for my boyfriend and I. It was really easy to catch the Orange line on the T and was only about a 35 minute walk from Fenway Park. \"",,,,,
4568116,31453305,2015-05-05,17649672,Sean,"Our first impression was that if we just added a small kitchen it would be a perfect little studio to live in. Check in was simple as it was just through numpad to get the key. The place was extremely well kept and clean. We loved that there was a couch and a TV to relax on. Bed was comfy. It was just a short walk to the nearest T station and then a few stops into the center of Boston, so that was very convenient. Parking was also very convenient as we found a place right outside the apartment.  Jonathan made sure that we checked in OK and offered suggestions/recommendations. We only stayed one night but I would have loved to stay more."
4568116,31635732,2015-05-08,28524869,Kenneth,"We had an excellent stay with Jonathan, who was helpful, polite and accomodating. He allowed us to leave our luggage up at the main house whilst when we checked out but before our flight. We arrived quite late into Boston but arrangements were such that it was easy to gain access to the studio, even though Jonathan was not in at the time. The studio itself was exactly as described - clean, functional and comfortable. Just what two weary travellers needed! Would recommend to friends and if we visit again will definitely consider staying with Jonathan again."
"A tip - the route from the nearest subway station to the studio has a reasonably steep uphill part so recommend an uber / taxi as we had a little trouble hauling two suitcases up the cobbled steps at midnight!\"",,,,,

Jonathan haben wir zwar leider nicht persönlich getroffen,er war aber per Mail sehr hilfreich (um bspw. unser Gepäck noch nach Checkout bei sich aufzubewahren) und nett. Check-In Zeiten sind variabel,da man über einen Code in die Wohnung kommt.,,,
Einziger Nachteil: Die Wohnung scheint sehr hellhörig und die Klimaanlage ist recht laut.,,,,,
"Alles in allem ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt. Die Wohnung ist wie beschrieben gut mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu erreichen. Für einen Citytrip nach Boston zu empfehlen.\"",,,,,

The location was amazing, on a beautiful street in a nice little neighborhood just a short walk from all of the action in Boston. The studio itself was cozy, perfect for the two of us, and was very clean and well maintained. It's small, so keep that in mind when booking, but I think that added to its charm. Jonathan was very accommodating and kept open communication in the days before my stay. I would recommend everyone to stay here, and will probably return on my next trip to Boston."

Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Jonathan due to timings of our stay but he made sure that he left the key for us, and was very communicative throughout our stay if there was anything we needed.

We were looking for something close to Fenway and this property fit our needs for a one night stay. Truth be told, we are not very familiar with the Boston neighborhoods and would suggest this property for those who are comfortable in the urban environment."
4568116,35505748,2015-06-19,35340869,Collene,Very cute place no problems finding it and plenty of parking. Was confused where the entrance was but Jonathan responded quickly and was helpful.

Very responsive to questions and provided all the required details to make it easy getting in and out of the rental. Photos of the rental are just as they appear. It's quite small but well appointed with everything you need. My one and only small ask would be for included wifi. The mobile/data service inside was sporadic making it hard to look up directions and info at times."

However we didn't feel 100% comfortable walking from the station at night, so might need to get a taxi or uber when coming back late."

The check-in instructions were very simple. The studio was spotless and is well designed. The location allowed us to get anywhere we wanted to go in Boston in a timely fashion (we thought we would use Public Transportation more but Uber rides were less than $10 to where we wanted to go (Fenway, ICA, MIT, North End)).

Jonathan made my stay easy and pleasant. I had several questions, which he answered promptly and politely. I did not get a chance to experience the neighborhood during daylight. I had some reservations about walking to the building from the subway station alone late at night, but it was fine. It was about a 10 minute walk. Once I left the station, I didn't see a single soul along the way. There are streetlights the entire way. Be warned, you do need to walk up a pretty steep hill for part of the route."

4568116,47496489,2015-09-19,10385914,Allie,"Jonathan was timely in responding to my emails and extremely accommodating regarding the time frames in which we needed to check in and out of his place. It made my first Airbnb experience seamless and positive. His place is quite small but it's well-organized, comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, and it's obvious that he puts a lot of thought into every little detail of the decor and the functionality of each aspect comprising the unit. The only slight issue is that the neighborhood was a little farther from some of the areas in Boston in which we were spending our time, but it was a very quick walk to the T, which once you get a handle on the public transit, the commuting is a breeze. We were impressed with Boston's train system, it's easy and clean and wasn't too crowded."
I would recommend this place to anyone as long as they are okay living out of a smaller space and are okay not being in an area with a lot of action (more of a true neighborhood,"lots of schools around). Thank you again so much Jonathan we were very impressed and satisfied with our stay!!\"",,,,
4568116,48279968,2015-09-25,3000963,Martin,"Jonathan was a nice host. Everything in the studio was perfect clean, especially the shower. The subway is only a short walk away and Communication was very easy. Best regards Martin"
4568116,48695548,2015-09-28,11135845,Meg,"This was my first Airbnb experience and Jonathan made it easy. He was a great host; friendly, kept in contact, and gave clear directions for check in and out. The studio matched the description listed and was very clean and comfortable. It had everything we needed. The location was perfect, near the t station but not in a noisy area. Would stay there again."
4568116,49413471,2015-10-03,12015004,David,Excellent place to stay when visiting Boston - great value for the money.  The place is clean and tidy and equipped with all the essentials for your visit. Jonathan was very professional and conscientious in arranging for my check in.

4568116,51823411,2015-10-24,10980060,Albert,"This is a wonderful little apt studio that has everything one needs and is what I'd characterize as very efficient. The room has a very cozy feeling to it and Jonathan has provided maps, guide books, a small fridge, an umbrella, closet space, table. It is also a very short walk to the subway and Jonathan made sure to check-in with us to make sure we were doing okay. Highly recommended."
4568116,52150105,2015-10-26,37723159,Bobby,"Jonathan's pad was absolutely perfect. It was very clean, organized and offered exactly what we needed for our weekend stay in Boston. The location is accessible via a short walk to the orange line T or by Uber cab. The apartment itself was well-designed and made wonderful use of the small (but cozy) space. A great studio and a great host."
4568116,52354005,2015-10-28,1215283,Christine,Das Studio ist genauso wie es auf den Bildern aussieht. Sehr gemütlich und modern eingerichtet. Jonathan hat jede Ecke des Raums genutzt und so ein sehr praktisches Studio auf engstem Raum geschaffen. Wir haben uns sofort wohl gefühlt.
Jonathan ist außerdem ein super Gastgeber. Wir haben ihn zwar nicht persönlich getroffen,er war aber jederzeit per E-Mail zu erreichen und hat uns all unsere Fragen beantwortet. Er hat sich auch während unseres Aufenthalts gemeldet,um zu fragen,ob alles in Ordung ist. Im Studio hat er kleine Aufmerksamkeiten,wie eine gefüllte Wasserkaraffe,Müsliriegel und einen Bosten-Reiseführer bereitgelegt. Auch das hat dazu beigetragen
"Zusammenfassend: ein tolles Studio für einen Kurztrip nach Boston. Gutes Preis/Leistungs-Verhältnis für Boston\"",,,,,

Thank you, Jonathan!"
4568116,55152222,2015-11-28,24289205,Steve,"I had a great stay at Jonathan's brownstone studio.  Jonathan went the extra mile to make me feel welcome, with snacks, water, and even a chocolate on the pillow. I would totally recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston.  I personally love the old Fort Hill neighborhood, but if you are not familiar with Boston, it is still a neighborhood in transition. It has some incredible history and architecture."
4568116,55763516,2015-12-05,26519988,Dylan,Jonathan was super friendly and made checking-in a breeze. The place is amazingly efficient at being small and reminded me of an IKEA ad. I fell in love with the place and it's use of space and even booked for another week as my work schedule was to keep me in Boston longer. Parking was always easy to grab within one block for free although I lucked out as my work schedule fit with the street cleaning parking rules. Highly recommended and plan to stay here more in the future.
4568116,56009536,2015-12-07,41198932,Khary,"Very nice private studio, I loved it!  Everything as advertised defenintly better than a hotel room. Private entrance and bathroom was a plus."

4568116,56570256,2015-12-14,26519988,Dylan,My third stay in this location. Couldn't be happier with Jonathan or the location. The place is an excellent little find and I look forward to more visits!
4568116,58092476,2015-12-31,36834122,Di,"The place is very clean and cozy, just as shown in the pics. Jonathan is a a wonderful host. He even lent me his jacket to help me to stay warm in cold Boston. I would definitely choose this place again if I go to Boston again."

4568116,63087637,2016-02-20,26519988,Dylan,"Jonathan's apartment a perfect little spot, this was my third time staying there for business and he makes everything very easy. He even took my advice from a previous review regarding accommodating for food allergies/restrictions in the snacks he provides with the apartment."
4568116,64318976,2016-03-02,53686522,Filippo,I have spent one month in the modern bedroom and around fifteen days in the studio downstairs of the Jonathan's Brownstone.
I have selected this house in Airbnb website for the great pictures of the room and when I have arrived there the spaces were better than the photos. The house is new inside,the spaces are clean and ordered,there are a lot of cabinets where you can store your things so it's simple maintain the order and leaves the spaces constantly organized.,,,
Jhonathan is a great host and a real friend. I have spent with him and the others (good) guests of the house a really good dinners,conversations and nights in pubs. I was far 6000km of my ' born house' but I have found there a good place to call 'house'.,,,,
P.S. An example that speaks itself about good host: ''during the most ice cold day in the Boston's winter from last 25 years (-20°C),it was quite cold inside the house caused to unfriendly weather,"so Jonathan promptly provides to buy more heaters and the house remain however comfortable! Great!\"",,,
4568116,64581827,2016-03-05,13342406,Margaretha,"This was the best AirBnB experience I've had. This private studio was so clean, elegant and thoughtful; I just loved it and wish I could have stayed longer."
I was in town because my mom was at Brigham and Women's,so I needed something quiet and relaxing. I was amazed by the level of detail in the space. Jonathan left maps and lists of things to do,and everything about this cosy studio was filled with exquisite taste.,,,
"\"",,,,,
4568116,64987772,2016-03-09,8046654,Rick,"Jonathan's place was totally awesome, I was in town for just one night for business and needed a place to simply sleep and shower. He was very responsive to all of my questions. The apartment itself is well decorated and has everything you need for a visit to Boston. While there isn't a kitchen, Jonathan is great about adding small touches such as a carafe of water, chocolates and maps with places to eat and other attractions nearby. I would highly recommend his place and will look forward to staying again with him in the future."
4568116,65438161,2016-03-13,62027548,Ashik,"All other reviews are bang on. Jonathan left the studio in the same condition that it was advertised. Bed was comfortable, the little provisions left were thoughtful and the bathroom, and the room itself was clean and inviting. The real star though, is the neighborhood. Minimal, and scenic walk to the train station and the neighborhood people were very friendly and provided us with advice and help on parking spots, and such."
Enjoyed my trip,and If I ever make a trip down to Boston,would not hesitate staying here again if the room is vacant.,,,

4568116,65717683,2016-03-16,20187616,Anna,"The place was well designed with every inch used, very cozy and nice! Parking was very easy to find as well. Snacks and chocolates was such a cute surprise"
4568116,66100232,2016-03-19,26988338,Marina,"The listing was accurate. The place was small, but not uncomfortably so, and very cute. On my drive to the neighborhood I was a bit nervous, it looked run down etc, but upon arriving at the house it was in great shape, as were the surrounding buildings."
4568116,66474333,2016-03-22,380198,Kara,"This place was fantastic. I was in Boston for a conference but didn't want to stay in a hotel. The Brownstone Cozy Private Studio reminded me of the Mosser Hotel in San Francisco. Super modern and truly cozy in the best possible way. It had everything that I needed to make my stay great. As other reviewers have commented, the place looks just like the pictures. Jonathan checked in with me when I arrived and was quick to answer my questions via text. He also had a list of his favorite places to visit in and around the neighborhood, which I appreciated."
4568116,66819005,2016-03-25,63273353,Théo,"The Studio was absolutely perfect, really functional, and perfectly located. Jonathan was making sure that everything was going good for us. We had a wonderful time in Boston. I recommend Jonathan's studio 100%."
4568116,66825741,2016-03-25,24426068,Bennett,"I felt very welcome. I was out and about for most of my stay. Jonathan was a very nice  and the studio was exactly as advertised. The Neighborhood is in transition, but close to a T station and a Dunkin Donuts, which I love. Check out was at 11AM, but my flight did not leave until much later. Jonathan graciously allowed me to leave my bags there for safe keeping while I was out on the town before catching my felt. This saved me a lot of headache and I was able to retrieve my bags later. There was a large container of water filled up upon arrival and breakfast foods. If you need a place to stay in Boston, this is a great option."
4568116,67659589,2016-03-30,1113872,John,"On this, my second stay, the place was perfectly clean, quiet, and private as before. Jonathan was immediately available and helpful when I had a question. Couldn't ask for better."
4568116,68627307,2016-04-05,672074,Katherine,"Jonathan is the ideal Airbnb host! Communication up to my arrival was upbeat and thorough, and the studio was exactly as described.  Clean, well-designed, perfect for one or two people on a short stay.  The neighborhood is very quiet and near everything.  Could not recommend more highly!"
4568116,68839479,2016-04-07,439962,Lacey,"This is a cute little studio that was exactly as advertised. Host made me feel very welcome and there so many nice little touches, including water by the bed side, coffee, tea and breakfast in the pantry and a map of the neighborhood. Photos are 100% accurate. Would defiantly stay here again!"
4568116,68998446,2016-04-08,63224011,Morgan,"Jonathan was welcoming and accommodating, the studio was just as beautiful as shown, and the neighborhood was quiet and easy to get to and from downtown Boston."
4568116,69260906,2016-04-10,9750515,Adam,"My stay at Jonathan's rental was wonderful.  While it is small, it is quite functional and comfortable - it is truly all you need.  I stayed here by myself but I can imagine it would be comfortable for 2 people too.  It is not too far from a metro stop, making the rest of the city quite accessible, and I had no difficulties getting an Uber at any time."
Jonathan really goes the extra mile to make your stay nice - there was chocolate waiting for me when I arrived!  The fridge had milk in it (with water on the window sill),while there were several pieces of fruit,granola bars,and cereal for the morning already laid out.  The fridge is quite large so if you have leftovers it would not be a problem to bring them back,and there is a microwave as well.  He conveniently left several pages of recommendations out,with travel books to refer to if you needed.  Best of all
In all honesty,the area didn't feel so great on the ride in from the airport,but once I arrived,the actual location of the apartment is very nice and was nice and quiet at night - I did not feel unsafe.  It is be a good place to explore the city from and to return home to at night.  Conveniently,there is a large grocery store within about a 15 min walk if you want to stock up on some extra food or snacks.,
The bathroom is a bit of a tight squeeze,but is clean,functional,and has everything you would need.,,
"Overall I had a great time and I would definitely stay here again if I was coming to Boston.\"",,,,,
4568116,70070623,2016-04-15,57228363,Gowri,Jonathan was a great host. He was easy to talk to and get advice about how to get about Boston.I really enjoyed all his recommendations! Especially all the food places in the area:) The description of the apartment was very accurate. It was so clean and he really has thought of everything! The train station was fairly nearby and easy to use. I never really took the train at night but a cab ride was easy to get and its not that far from the city.
4568116,70157353,2016-04-16,39402830,Markos,This was my first time using airBNB and Im a little worried about using it again because I dont think my next experience could be anymore FREAKING AWESOME AS THIS ONE! Jonathan's spot is swaggy and legit. The studio is the perfect size. I felt at home. I only saw Jonathan once while I was there but he had good vibes!! When I visit Boston again I plan to stay here.
4568116,70630650,2016-04-19,14731406,Jen,"What an absolutely perfect place to stay when in Boston!  It was conveniently located near everything and the studio itself was fantastic.  So much thought was given to how the small but perfectly practical space was laid out.  As other reviews mentioned, this place is all about the details....from water in a carafe and chocolates waiting for us at our arrival, to large bottles of shampoo and body wash in the shower, to city maps and food recommendations printed out for us to take.  Jonathan was a fantastic host - he was very welcoming and checked in several times to ensure our stay was going well.  We came into town for the Boston Marathon....he texted us several times wishing us luck and asking post-race how it went.  He went above and beyond and we plan to stay here again when we head back to Boston."
4568116,70889898,2016-04-21,1607836,Juan,"I had a great time staying at the studio. Jonathan takes great pride and care in having a place that's clean, comfortable, safe and relaxing. He provided maps, suggestions for places to go to, activities to do and a lot of context for the neighborhood and the city.  I highly recommend your stay here!"
4568116,71034807,2016-04-23,56611479,Emma,"Jonathan was an excellent host! He really went out of his way to make things easy for me with a very late arrival, explaining how to find the place, how to get in, etc - and left the lights on! He gave a lot of good advice and patiently answered my questions about the heating and wifi, very promptly, even though it was late!"
He also left some fruit,cereal,and milk which was very thoughtful and a comfort to know if jet-lag woke me up in the middle of the night starving I'd be ok!,,,
Jonathan also allowed me a late check-out which was a huge help as I wasn't picking up my rental car until 3pm,so I was able to leave my bags and spend the morning out and about.,,,,
The flat is lovely,bright and very clean. It smells new and is very cozy. I thoroughly enjoyed coming back to it! The fold-down table was perfect for spreading out my work so I could get a few hours in.  As you can see from the pictures,it is a very petite studio but it is really all you need!,,,
The neighbourhood was very quiet overall,with the only exception being a gospel church service from 7.30-9pm on Friday night! Once I figured out what it was I could only laugh and enjoy it! But unless you go to bed very early this will not bother you,and is probably not loud enough to bother young children.,,,
My only other comment for travelers would be that there is no air-con. This wasn't a problem in April but potentially could be if you came in the heat of summer and are not used to hot climates.,,,,,
I cannot recommend Jonathan and his flat enough. I am a pretty picky person,I like tidy,clean,and quiet,"and I found his flat wonderful. I would stay there again in a heartbeat!\"",
4568116,72373029,2016-05-02,64548612,Peter,"I had a great stay at Jonathan's apartment. To begin, Jonathan gave very clear instructions as to how to get access to the apartment and what his expectations were while I stayed there. Also, the apartment was immaculate, it was really clean!! And Jonathan has decorated the apartment very nicely too."
Their is cable tv with lots of channels and fast wireless internet. The apartment is in a nice neighborhood and is just a short walk to public transportation.,,,,,
One downside is the bathroom is pretty small and the sink area is kind of cramped. Also,the shower is really tiny. It is like a small square and if you are a larger person you may have considerable trouble using this shower comfortably.,,,,
"Though Jonathan did provide several clean towels and body rinse and shampoo in the shower. Besides the small gripe about the bathroom everything was great. Jonathan was very responsive and answered all of my questions well and very quickly. Jonathan was a great host and I highly recommend you stay at this apartment!\"",,,,,

4568116,73727112,2016-05-09,70203138,Henry,"Jonathon was an awesome host. He was very caring and genuine while planning our trip, making sure if everything was okay. He still kept in touch without being there. If you have any questions, it feels easy to ask him as it's very clear that he is open ears and cares about his guests. And most importantly we loved the place! It was extremely clean, simple and what we expected."
4568116,74061429,2016-05-12,12161527,Craig,"What a wonderful visit! Jonathan was very communicative from the start, answered my questions and gave great directions and I love the style of the studio.

The studio offered just the right amount of space for my wife and I, and was perfectly located right outside downtown in a quiet residential area. Beautiful."
4568116,75748931,2016-05-22,41396818,Alana,"We had a perfectly cost stay at the brownstone. It was only one night, but exactly the safe, clean, and comfortable kind of place we were looking for. Jonathan provides those nice, welcoming touches (snacks!) that make you feel at home. The neighborhood is steeped in unique history, if you have time to explore during your stay. great location for getting to all areas of Boston and the highways out of town. It's an efficiency, so the space is small, but we were only there overnight so it was fine for us. Only negative is that the bathroom sink is painful small, making it difficult to get in there to wash your face/brush your teeth. Water inevitably gets onto the hardwood floors below so even though we wiped it, it will inevitably lead to water damage. Overall, a really nice place to stay for a quick trip to town. Highly recommended."
4568116,77311073,2016-05-31,31858829,Joshua,Jonathan was a great host. The apt was immaculate when I got there. Everything was just as advertised. He left maps of popular spots around boston and was extremely helpful.

The place itself is exactly as pictured - compact, cozy and clean. I was a bit uncomfortable in the location itself, was in a loud neighbourhood at night, especially as this suite is on the ground floor. However, proximity to subway was great."

Everything possible was included in the small space: toiletries, refrigerator, clothing iron and even snacks are provided. I slept well and felt very comfortable. I did utilize the T and it was a quick 10 minute walk to the Roxbury station. I got to meet Jonanthan and he was very nice and communicative the entire process."

4568116,81930385,2016-06-25,70389313,Ciel,"The apartment was small, clean and very comfortable. Jonathan was very helpful and provided very detailed infomation about locating the apartment. I had one issue caused by myself which Jonathan quickly addressed promptly. Also parking was easily to find near the apartment which was great. In summary, great place , very accomdating host and defintely a value for you money."
4568116,82662546,2016-06-28,9754437,Esti,"It is indeed a cozy space! Jonathan did a great job of utilizing hidden space in the room without making it feel cramped. Everything we needed was included - there were tour books, Bostonian brews, a table and chairs, and an iron and ironing board! At night the room was a nice dark cave (a bit of outside city noise, but nothing crazy) and morning chirping birds!"
Location wise,"the place was a good 45 min walk to downtown Boston and a leisurely 30 min walk to the art museum and parks. (The \"\"T\"\" was close","but nearby stations were closed for our duration). The neighborhood was definitely \"\"in transition\"\"",but we had no issues coming and going. Free street parking was a plus!,,
(As a side note,if you are a person of the larger variety,you may have issue in the bathroom. The shower and toilet areas are both in smaller alcoves that might make things tricky),,,
Very hospitable,"cozy space - A+!\"",,,,
4568116,82777542,2016-06-29,2324709,Chad,"I had an unexpected layover in Boston and was in sore need of a place to rest my head at night. Jonathan, place was available for immediate reservation and he was very responsive to all of my needs with no advance notice. The unit was well put together in a nice neighborhood and I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a cozy home base from which they can explore Boston. Thanks Jonathan for a great experience on such short notice!"

4568116,83431086,2016-07-02,29573509,Mike,Jonathan's place was very clean and convenient for my quick trip to Boston. It was about a $8-10 uber ride to Fenway park which worked out great for my 1 day trip to the city.
4568116,84111090,2016-07-05,68233181,Aikaterini,"My husband and me had a delightful stay at Jonathan's place.  We were in town as tourists.  The location was convenient and close to a metro stop.  The apartment is small, but beautiful and comfortable.  Jonathan is so ready to answer any questions, helping us in our stay and touring. We definitely recommend it to others. Thanks Jonathan."
4568116,84458324,2016-07-07,25607302,Kristine,Jonathon was great! He welcomed us to Boston and even sent us a note on a parking spot that was open right outside the door. The studio was in great condition and very cozy. We will defiantly stay again when we are back in Boston.
4568116,84461423,2016-07-07,22972790,Geoff,"Had a great stay in the studio - it's cleverly and cozily laid out, and we felt welcomed and at home. Jonathan was an excellent communicator and host, and we had a nice chat with his mother when we bumped into her on our arrival. Plenty of parking, and convenient to what we had planed for the afternoon (the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and Fenway Park). Would definitely stay here next time we're in town! Absolutely one of our best Airbnb experiences yet."

The neighborhood is charming and within close walking distance of the T and lots of restaurants. Overall, my stay definitely lived up to expectations. I would stay there again anytime!"

4568116,87538755,2016-07-20,82806306,Dick,"Very well situated in a charming quiet neighbourhood within easy reach of the 'T' & Mission Hill. The apartment has everything you need, is impeccably clean and tasteful and well thought out. Jonathan's recommendations for dining out were spot-on. Can recommend this without hesitation!"
4568116,88591984,2016-07-24,51236803,Jessica,Have you ever watched HGTV Tiny House Hunters and wondered how it'd be to live in a tiny home? Well this studio is perfect for that! I loved how clean and how smart Jonathan used the space. I highly appreciated staying in an Air B&B that didn't feel lived in. There are no personal items of Jonathan's  laying about which makes you feel like you're in your own private tiny home and not just crashing in someone place. You have your own entrance and parking isn't much trouble at all. The walk to the Orange T is closer than you think which made getting around Boston easy. I'd definitely stay here if I'm ever in Boston again.
4568116,89645245,2016-07-29,37520254,Bridgette,"Jonathan was really helpful and responded quickly to questions. The apartment is very clean and full of light, perfect for a short stay. And the jug of water in the fridge was really welcome when we arrived on a hot afternoon. Thank you for that."
4568116,89889884,2016-07-30,9292744,Irene,Fabulous--very adorable studio with all the right amenities. Jonathan was extremely flexible despite a last minute change in plans. It was a beautiful and quiet place with easy access to the rest of Boston.

Kayla was extremely welcoming and went above and beyond in accommodating my wife and I. Even going to the effort of clearing out a dresser for us to use while we were staying. The location was perfect to access all parts of city via the T, but within walking distance of countless restaurants and shops. Just a heads up, if you are a coffeeholic, there was not a coffee maker we could find, but some amazing coffee shops nearby :-) Seriously couldn't believe how beautiful our surroundings were every morning when we woke up! We would certainly stay here again in the future!"
9473816,90037095,2016-07-31,2066238,Jasmine,We loved the place. It was perfect for our family and in the nicest area. We hope to come back next year. Kayla was very responsive. The building was nice and we liked the décor as well.
5726250,37333274,2015-07-06,34220536,Steve,Had a great time staying in this perfect home!  Very clean and the host did well to leave us a few snacks and basics in the kitchen.  All linens were fresh and clean.
The neighborhood was a treat.  We toured Boston,"but really enjoyed having a \"\"real\"\" neighborhood experience.  Area had available restaurants and necessities.  We used the T",Uber,and also got the Boston SuperTours Premium pass which had a pick-up (#5 on their map) a short walk from the home.,,
The hosts were very responsive and asked for confirmation that we were settled well without any questions.,,,,,

The neighborhood was very safe too.  Heather was quite response to our questions and even allowed a sister early access to her home.  This is not a rental unit but their actual home.

They were great at communicating before our trip to make sure any questions we had were answered and also to give tips on the neighborhood.

Your home is beautiful and we enjoyed staying in it while we were in Boston.  We left everything just as we found it and hope that in a couple of years when our son graduates from Grad.

5726250,90476666,2016-08-01,82703215,Christoph,"We (family with two small children under four) had a great time in Boston. This house plays an important part in having such a great time. It is located close to the beginning of the freedom trail, thus, you are able to explore the historic sites per foot, if you (and the rest of your crew) like to walk. The hosts obviously have kids themselves. Our kids loved the little steps you find in the bathroom to reach the sink - just a lovely place also prepared to live with kids. If you have no kids, this is fine also as all toys are orderly put in the kids' rooms. Many thanks for the good stay. If we come back to Boston, we'll be in touch for another visit."

4516065,56811772,2015-12-18,7260242,Philip,This is a very nice place. Feels more like a hotel than an AirBNB. The keys are left for pickup outside. Finding the actual place was pretty difficult though - there was supposed to be a map showing which building in the complex I was supposed to go to. It was a struggle finding my way without that.
Inside the apartment there are little gift baskets full of the things you'll need (toilet paper,paper towels,shampoos and things). There's also plenty of space and a nice kitchen if you need to cook anything.,,,

8231382,54543721,2015-11-21,13427284,Gideon,"The location of the apartment was great. It was a very short walk to the Charlie, and from there a very short bus ride to the airport. There was also a wonderful pub one block down that we went to almost every night for drinks and appetizers. The apartment was small and cozy, but we noticed a lingering odor of old smoke or something equally strong when we first entered the apartment and couldn't get rid of through our whole stay (we even used an aerosol air freshener). The bathroom wasn't thoroughly cleaned either. Overall our experience wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest. We would definitely stay there again if they fixed a few things."

8231382,57066143,2015-12-21,6170303,Diane,The apartment in East Boston was clean and sunny as described.  Checking in and out was very easy because of lock box.  We had no problems so we did not have to contact Gavin during our stay. Apartment very convenient to airport and East Boston is an interesting neighborhood to explore.  We have relatives living nearby so the place was particularly convenient for us. The only thing I did not find was a coffee maker - which would have been nice to have.  But maybe it was there and I missed it. I would stay again on a future trip to Boston.
8231382,58937529,2016-01-05,13245070,Miriam,My girlfriend and I stayed at Gavins apartment in Boston. The apartment was nice and clean. Gavin was responding very fast to all our questions and made our stay easy. It was easy to get to Boston Downtown from there. It was very nice! Thank you!

8231382,70619991,2016-04-19,8769648,Marjolaine,We rented this studio during the Boston Marathon weekend. The description and the pictures of the studio were accurate. It took generally 25-30min to go to the city with 10min walk. It's alright but the neighborhood is not really fancy. The kitchen was OK. We managed to cook some meals. One of the issue was that the apartment was not well soundproof. We could hear people coming/leaving the building and most of all the neighbor above the apartment. It's alright if you don't go to sleep too early. Not too great when you need to recover from jetlag and rest before a marathon... We stayed in touch with Gavin via Airbnb messages. He answered quickly and gave us good directions to get the keys for the studio. He also sent an email to the neighbor for him to try to be more quiet. He also pointed out some restaurants in the area.
8231382,71334663,2016-04-24,5451924,David,Great decor. Well stocked with amenities. Easy access to the T station. Street parking was relatively easy to find. Restaurants and pubs with good food are within walking distance. Very flexible check in and check out times. Really nice guy to talk to and very attentive to our needs. Just what we needed.
8231382,71746799,2016-04-28,5306103,Garrison,"it was a beautiful home, much bigger than I expected. Very easy to be comfortable and it is a very nice walk to the train from the house. Gavin was the perfect host and answered any questions I had. Thank you for allowing us into your home Gavin."

We reserved the place for three people but only one bed was ready. We had to search for the bedding and prepare the bed for the third person. Furthermore, the bed was a double not a queen and the \"\"other bed\"\" was a futon. The lights in the entrance were not working. On the first morning (Friday morning )we found that the place was very noisy both outside the building and inside. The overall appearance was less then desirable. For what we got"
On a positive note,"there were many small grocery stores in the area and it was in walking distance from the train station. Also the place was a good size.\"",,,,
8231382,75961282,2016-05-23,20773170,Catherine,"Gavin left clear instructions for getting into the flat and we found it without any trouble. Within 10min walking distance to the train station and only a couple of stops into the centre of Boston. The flat had everything we needed for 2 people, although it was a little noisy from outside and also neighbours. The flat is in a local area and we tried out one of the nearby restaurants Gavin had recommended which was great."
8231382,77361278,2016-05-31,32301456,David,Listing was accurate and a good representation of the apartment. Location was great (5 minutes walk from the airport T station on the blue line) - very easy to get anywhere. Centre of town was about 10-15 minutes on the T. The area has a number of great restaurants. Would recommend.
8231382,78252902,2016-06-06,22501892,Ashley,Everything was great. Liked the location and easy access to the train. Studio was spacious and accommodating.

There was an issue with the thermostat and Gavin was super helpful and responsive to make sure it was resolved. It was a convenient, short walk through a cute park to the blue line to downtown. There was free street parking too! The Mexican food right next door was SO good. Definitely recommend for an inexpensive, private stay in East Boston!"
8231382,81708285,2016-06-24,9421800,Jack,"Apartment satisfied my expectations.  It was clean, comfortable and roomy.  Gavin responded quickly to my one question.  Parking was no problem and we used the convient subway most of the time.  The neighborhood had a family and spanish atmosphere with lots of children and people outside.  I always felt comfortable and safe."

8231382,84204737,2016-07-06,31377890,Janet,"Gavin's place was as nice and clean as pictured.  The stairway up is a little scary but that's okay, it's a stairwell.  He leaves you with a very detailed manual on how to get there and what options you could to take.  In addition, the place is very spacious and big enough for four people!  Not too close to center-city, but definitely close to the airport, and you can't hear the airplanes fly over which is a relief."
8231382,84929509,2016-07-09,39680553,Marilena,The studio is so below average and very expensive for what it offers! For the same money per night you can stay at a hotel and enjoy safety and cleanliness!
-The building is old,with dirty walls and stuff around,and weird people get in and out,,,
-The neighbourhood is not one of the good places to stay in Boston. If you are girls only,or a family it is not safe,,,,
-The apartment looked clean but you could not realise if the towels in the bathroom were clean or the bed. It didn't t have that smell of clean clothes. There were also things used in the house,and even in the bathroom that made you feel bad,,,,
-There were expired foods in the fridge (the owner suggests that we throw them away but when you see an expired milk like 10 days and it is not yours yoy dont wanna touch it),,,,,
-It is impossible to open the windows,"as it is either unsafe or very noisy\"",,,,

4291607,41042396,2015-08-03,21917349,Gerson,The apartment was completely amazing. Cozy and perfect for my wife and me that were in a working weekend. Really close to the train and was really accurate with the pictures. She was really kind and everything was perfect.

1471373,6502038,2013-08-14,6572598,Nusch & Engel,"Ali was a very nice host, the location of her place is good and the room was very comfortable. Also, Ali cooked us a lovely dinner, she is a great cook! Thank you Ali!"
1471373,8108485,2013-10-15,3489093,Matt,"A totally seamless, no-hassle experience -- I was in Boston just for a quick evening, and Alexandra was happy to provide last-minute accommodation. The room was extremely clean, organized, and all logstics went off without a hitch. This is definitely the way airBNB was designed to work."
"Thanks Alexandra!\"",,,,,
1471373,8188598,2013-10-20,4826935,Coral,"Great experience! Alexandra is awesome! She is super organised and very creative. The room/facilities had everything we needed and more. We really felt like home in there. The apartment is cozy, clean and is located in a great area, close to the Green Line and some great local pubs!"

1471373,8418050,2013-10-29,780137,Hakan,"For the price I paid, airbed was really an uncomfortable option. A basic mattress would have done miracles on my stay. Still, the location is very practical for commuting around Boston, and the place was clean and spacious."
1471373,8614604,2013-11-08,9574358,Mary,"Alexandra is an excellent host. She is friendly and very accommodating. The rooms were clean and equipped with basic needs.   I was happy to have a kitchen and access to a coffee maker. The location is close to both the orange and green lines of the T, as well as a very nice supermarket. And the Basilica in Mission Hills is really worth seeing.   I felt very comfortable and would book with Alexandra again should the opportunity arise."
1471373,9768433,2014-01-08,2459592,Ken,"Cordial, Accommodating, Considerate, Highly Recommend!"
1471373,11227112,2014-03-25,9812826,Derek,"Alexandra was a welcoming and considerate host! The room was clean and comfortable enough, we were free to sit in/watch TV in/warm food up in/etc. the rest of the house, and the apartment was in a good location for us to take the T (subway) around."
1471373,11742605,2014-04-14,12012027,Jeff,"Perfect location for us, near both green and orange lines. The rooms were nice. We were hardly ever at the apartment, but when we needed Alexandra, she was there. I've no complaints."
1471373,14491168,2014-06-20,1548003,Michael,"I couldn't find a last minute hotel in Boston because of graduation season, so I decided to try airbnb for the first time.  Alexandra was great!  She was very quick to reply to my request, so I decided to give her place a try.  The apartment was clean, and Alexandra had clean sheets and towels ready for us.  The air mattresses were surprisingly comfortable. The location was perfect, and near both the green and orange lines.    Alexandra was also nice and accommodating.  I highly recommend this place!"

1471373,14844900,2014-06-27,11197371,Jan,Very nice location and a great and flexible host!
1471373,14856979,2014-06-28,2774354,Kristin,"Alexandra's place was a conveniently located and easy to find apartment in the Mission Hill neighborhood. She had clear instructions to get there and a very complete notebook of instructions for guests once they arrived. The apartment was very nice and the room was fine - pretty much as described. We had to wait quite a while to use the bathroom at night, but that might have been another guest. I appreciated the use of her fridge to store a big fish, as well as her tips on places to shop and eat."
1471373,15990087,2014-07-19,18090743,Mateusz,Excellent location close to public transport. Great room. Alexandra was a wonderful host
1471373,18235054,2014-08-24,15899694,Marie,Alexandra was really accommodating upon our arrival. She arranged to give us the keys even if she was not at home when we arrived.
She also allowed us to us the laundry machine,which we really appreciated!,,,,
The room is exactly as on the picture. The beds were actually air mattresses,which we did not noticed while reading the add... The room and the bathroom were clean.,,,,
The two negative points are that 1) the air conditioning conducts directly opens in the room and the air conditioning sometimes starts in the middle of the night blowing cold air on your face and making a lot of noise and 2) that the smell of the Subway restaurant spreads in the whole apartment.,,,,,
Otherwise,the house was located close to the subway which was really convenient to go in town.  The neighborhood was great. There were some cafe and bars. There was also a supermarket close to the subway.,,,,
In my opinion,"this place is nice for a short stay.\"",,,,
1471373,18806986,2014-09-01,18423551,Jen,"Alexandra was a great host. Her home is comfortable, extremely conveniently located, and while she was gone to work most of the time, the little chances we had to spend time with Alexandra were great. I feel like we made a friend. She was very good about helping us navigate the city, and giving us a local's perspective on things. Overall: fantastic price and location, great host, A+++ would book again."
1471373,19627891,2014-09-15,2186286,Michael,The neighborhood and location was REALLY convenient for us.  We didn't spend much time at the actual place because we were busy all weekend in Boston.  Parking is hard to find in the area.
1471373,19745436,2014-09-17,326498,Guy,"I had a great stay with Alexandra.  The neighborhood, and the property, have noticeable warmth & charm.  The host is very organized and warm, making arrival & departure very easy."
1471373,20008891,2014-09-22,18064601,Magdalena,Alexandra jest miłą osobą. Pokój był czysty i cichy. Blisko do Green Line.
1471373,20562970,2014-10-01,5625263,Sébastien,"\"Good location, next to the \"\"T\"\" - Birgham Circle"
About the room : clean,2 bed with air matress,quite comfy.,,,
The apartment is just above a Subway,"so there is a smell of \"\"pizza\"\" in the room (and more again in the stairs of the building).",,,,
The air conditioning opens in the room and starts in the middle of the night blowing cold air and makes a lot of noise.,,,,,
About the bathroom : Alexandra provides us 6 towels,the bathroom was quite clean. However,we had to remove some hairs in the bathtub,,,
before taking a shower.,,,,,
About the rest of the apartment : clean,large kitchen with oven,microwave,fridge (you can put your own things inside)...Very well,,
organized.,,,,,
About the host : Alexandra is a very discreet person - but if we wouldn't have asked few questions,she wouldn't have talked with us.,,,,
When we tried to speak with her,we had the impression to disturb her. She answered but it was quite succinct.,,,,
We were a little bit awkward when she was there.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1471373,21347906,2014-10-15,21342289,Jianguo,Alexandra is quite accommodating and friendly during our stay. The house is near to two T stations and easy to reach most of attractions in Boston. A good experience!
1471373,21509124,2014-10-19,19272470,Margarita,"Alexandra consiguió que nos sintièsemos incómodas, por varias razones: el apartamento estaba sucio, desordenado, maloliente; la habitación era pequeña  y no cabían las maletas abiertas ni ningún mueble, excepto las tres camas hinchables; el sistema de aire acondicionado se disparaba solo y producía demasiado frío y ruido que salía de una rejilla en la habitación."
1471373,21714414,2014-10-22,21839360,Jenny,"A very nice apartment. The room is very clean. The location is perfect, and just 5 minutes' walk to the green line. The host is a nice person."
1471373,22599019,2014-11-10,22461071,Atsuka,"The location is great !It only takes a few minutes walk to go to restaurants, bars, and a convenience store, and there also is a train station close to the place. Alexandra is nice that she helped us with transportation system which we were not faimliar.Thank you Alexandra!"
1471373,22837133,2014-11-16,21090151,Stephen,"This is our first airbnb experience. I think the best thing about Alexandra's place is its convenient location (3 mins from subway). And her work place is just across the street of her flat, that really add a lot of flexibility on the check in time. The room is located almost at the end of the corridor so it gives the guests a lot of privacy."
1471373,23155959,2014-11-24,22109666,Lydia,"Boston is a beautiful city whileas the people here.  Alexandera's house is so well organized and she makes the home clean and neat as hotel while hospitalized home-like.  The coffee in every morning is tasty.  The air mattress is a brand new experience for me, comfortable and fun.  The location is quite convenient in transportation."
1471373,25938623,2015-01-30,26192388,Antonio,"La recepción fue amigable, dado que llegué bastante tarde para los horarios de Estados Unidos. Además, en todo el proceso previo Ali me ofreció toda la información posible. Puso a mi disposición todos los elementos necesarios: sábanas, mantas, toallas, zapatillas de baño, así como me facilitó el acceso libre a todas las estancias comunes. En el barrio no tuve ningún problema. Justo era lo que necesitaba: el apartamento está situado a 5 minutos de la Harvard School of Public Sciences. La casa fue en todo momento bastabte cálida gracias a la calefacción, y según Ali , como en ese barrio los cables de la electricidad van enterrados, no hubo riesgo serio de quedarse sin electricidad pese al paso de la tormenta invernal Juno."
Ali en todo momento fue amigable,discreta y dispuesta a ayudar. Me informó con antelación de que disponía de nuevos muebles. La habitación donde yo estuve antes disponía de dos camas,mientras que ahora consta de literas. Quizá hubiera preferido camas,pero tampoco fue incómodo dormir en literas. Igualmente habría sido bueno contar con una silla dentro del cuarto,pero lo cierto es que se trata de algo secundario cuando puedes acceder al salón y a los espacios comunes.,
En definitiva,recomendaría este alojamiento para estancias cortas,mejor para personas que viajan solas y no buscan lujos asiáticos,sino un lugar cálido y cómodo,para evitar lo caros que son los hoteles en Boston. Es un apartamento bien situado respecto a Longwood Medical Area y con buenas conexiones con el centro. Permite conocer cómo viven los estadounidenses. Hay tiendas restaurantes y supermercados cerca,"de modo que la vida no se hace difícil.\""
1471373,27352450,2015-03-02,14781014,미선,"This place's advantage is near T.. that's it. This room is only good for spring or summer NOT winter i guess, because of heater inside of room. Every ten minutes? or twenty minutes there was sound of heater.. it was disaster. If there was no heater, its gonna be freezing inside. Also, this room has a bunk not like a picture. Moreover, if you want to fine a more friendly host.. you should fine another place to stay. My mom and I just stayed here for two days out of a week and changed the place to Sharaton hotel in Boston. I was really disappointed both this place and Airbnb as well."

1471373,27888237,2015-03-14,28063303,Zachary,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and my experience with Alexandra is making me trust this website a lot more. The listing was pretty accurate, that said, the apartment was being close to the T train and close to different cafes and restaurants, which makes her place very convenient. I was also very surprised how clean her home was. It was very comfortable to stay in the room. Even when the bathroom is shared, the bathroom remained super clean as well! I really enjoyed my stay."
1471373,28170789,2015-03-19,27630368,Maria,The place is simple but good. So it worths the price. It gives a lot of privacy and Alexandra makes you comfortable. The room doesn't look exactly like the picture but it is fine. It would be good to have a humidifier for the winter though. The only issue is that I slipped in the bathtub because there was no anti- slip mat. This hurt even after two days.
1471373,32970783,2015-05-24,4336088,Melissa,"Alexandra was a nice and quiet host. She was very flexible with meeting us. The apartment is in a good location with food and transportation nearby.  It is very clean and quiet. We were a bit disappointed to find that instead of the two twin beds that are pictured and described, the room has metal bunk beds. I would not have knowingly booked a room with bunk beds, but our stay was enjoyable anyway."
1471373,33284651,2015-05-26,29315123,Sarah,"The room doesn't look exactly like the picture and is smaller. The thir d person sleeps on an air mattress, which tends to deflate during the night."
The apartment is located right above a Subway restaurant and you can feel the smell even in the room...,,,,,
I can't say anything on Alexandra as long as she did not feel like making a conversation with us,"and did not say a word when we left...\"",,,,

1471373,38862139,2015-07-19,34618787,Ning,"Location is very convinced to take subway, room is really small to fit three people of my family. Our living room has no key, we almost meet a trouble on the door opening, finally, Alexandra give some suggestions to get it solved."
1471373,39623422,2015-07-25,33469576,Ling,"Alexandra is kind except for not liking conversation, but if you turn to her,  she is ready for help. The bedroom is small for three people, especially no table to use our computer. The double-deck beds and air-mattress bed are okay. The bathroom is clean."
1471373,40347090,2015-07-30,2810732,Kathleen,Alexandra was a very good host and all things were in order when I arrived. I had to stay extra time and she was most accommodating.

1471373,42611357,2015-08-14,38958742,Tavio,"There was a slight communication hiccup in the beginning on arrival times. Seemed like we started off on the wrong foot. However after that things were fine. Pretty nice location, close to the subway. She kept to herself which was okay with us. Would book again."
1471373,43244866,2015-08-18,11349302,Annika,"Three of us stayed at Alexandra's apartment this past weekend and we found it very conveniently close to the green T line. The apartment was clean and modern, but we didn't love the smell of the Subway that is right below. The room is simple with thin mattresses, and it had bunk beds rather than twin beds. Pictures online should be updated. Overall, Alexandra is welcoming and accommodating even though the room is not the most comfortable."

1471373,45655344,2015-09-05,5456571,Melak,"I stayed with Alexandra for a week.  My daughter was with me for some of the time as we were waiting to move her in to her residence hall at Northeastern (a 20 minute walk away).  Alexandra made us feel very welcome and helped us tremendously by explaining Boston transport, the best shopping options for fitting out a dorm room and providing countless other quirky tips on what to expect from life in the city.  The apartment was very clean and the beds are stacked which makes the room really spacious.  The kitchen is modern and large and the living room has a very pleasant bay window looking out onto Tremont Street.  The area around Alexandra's flat always had a moderate number of people around so I never felt nervous walking out at night to go to the Walgreens, Stop&Shop or any of the countless restaurants and cafes nearby. This was the first time I had ever booked a room in someone's house or flat and I was apprehensive as to how it would go however everything went so well that I will look into staying with Alexandra through Air BnB the next time I am in Boston."

Being above subway it did smell like subway in the mornings. Room was a little dusty, but else, it was good value for money. House was clean and organised, and Alexandra was great, flexible with check in and out timing."

We actually walked from apartment to the Boston Public Garden and it didn't feel very far. The room was very spacious and clean. Alexandra was there to buzz us in and greet us.

1471373,65576849,2016-03-15,27162402,Seungwoo,Great location and room! It was awesome experience ☺️
1471373,69324097,2016-04-10,65150051,Maura,"The room and bathroom were both very clean, and it was helpful to have a binder with some tips and reminders about the apartment. The set-up of the room was different than pictured as we had a bunkbed and an air-mattress. The location was very convenient for us because it was within walking distance of a few neighborhoods and the T, and there were even a couple of nice restaurants and pubs on the block. We had a good experience here, except for that the air-mattress started deflating very quickly and must have been leaky, so our friend had to inflate it multiple times in the nights. (This was not Alexandra's fault though - I'm sure she didn't realize it was leaky.) Know that one bed is an air-mattress and you'll have to duke it out as to who gets the real beds! (Hopefully the air-mattress is replaced by then.)"
1471373,70198098,2016-04-16,61470284,James,Worst ever! Smell bad from closed Windows and food smell. Bathroom shower curtain had blood stain on it. Heat was time off for long time at night.  No chair in bedroom. Common living room was littered with clothes and not usable.

Ze was ook niet behulpzaam hierbij. De kamer was niet zoals op de foto. In plaats van 2 aparte boxspringbedden, stond er een stapelbed. De kwaliteit van de matrassen was erg slecht, de ijzeren stangen waren goed te voelen. Alexandra stond erop dat we onze schoenen bij de deur uit deden en op blote voeten door haar nogal vieze huis liepen. Zowel keuken (etensresten, afval opgestapeld), badkamer (vieze wc papiertjes op de grond) als woonkamer waren vies. Ook stonden de ruimtes vol met niet opgeruimde spullen. Alexandra zelf was weinig toegankelijk, wij hebben haar niet als een goede gastvrouw ervaren."

1471373,88706982,2016-07-25,22072620,Juliane,"Alexandra hat uns vor der Haustür angetroffen, die Begrüßung war recht knapp und sehr gleichgültig, was für uns enttäuschend war. Als dann unser Zimmer trotz avisierter Ankunftszeit nicht fertig war und Müllsäcke im Flur und vor der Haustür herumstanden, hatten wir größte Befürchtungen. Leider war bei unserer Ankunft gerade die Reinigungskraft im Einsatz und hatte eine unfassbar große Anzahl von Abfalltüten zum Abtransport in den Flur und vor die Haustür gestellt. Alexandra hat unser Zimmer dann aber schnell hergerichtet und die Reinigung der Wohnung war auch irgendwann beendet. Leider hat sich unsere Gastgeberin für ein Gespräch mit uns jedoch nicht mehr als 2 Minuten Zeit genommen und sich dann ins Wochenende verabschiedet. Das Zimmer mit Doppelstockbett mit einer zusätzlichen Luftmatratze können wir nicht empfehlen, da die Klimaanlage hier extrem laut arbeitet(e) und von uns Gästen nicht abgestellt werden konnte. Positiv war die Bereitstellung u.a. von Kaffee, Milch und Tee nach Bedarf. Alles in allem war es während unseres 2-tägigen Aufenthaltes recht unpersönlich; wir hätten gerne ein paar Insidertipps erhalten. Die Lage der Wohnung ist strategisch sehr günstig für alle Sehenswürdigkeiten Bostons."

9117009,53153201,2015-11-05,10130075,Jeffrey,Giovanni's place is in a great neighborhood and location.
He made me feel welcome and genuinely cared about hosting me.,,,,,
He had towels and toiletries ready for me and throughout my stay was a great host.,,,,,
"I would stay with him again and recommend him to anyone staying in the area!\"",,,,,
9117009,53445648,2015-11-08,6167603,Elie,"Giovani was very welcoming, we have share vine, cheese, and good time. The apartment is in the middle of North end. I really recommended his apartment for spend fun time in Boston!"
9117009,71176237,2016-04-24,1399429,Ryan,"Gio and Laura were lovely, friendly, and helpful hosts. The location was fantastic with so much available within walking distance. The bed and room were clean and comfortable. Thanks for the great home base for my visit to Boston!"
9117009,71863794,2016-04-29,46523972,Giovanna,"L'accoglienza di Giovanni è stata cortese e puntuale, ci ha fornito tutte le indicazioni necessarie e le informazioni che avevamo richiesto. L'appartamento è in un ottima   posizione in pieno quartiere Italiano, comodo per raggiungere i luoghi di maggior interesse anche a piedi.  La camera è pulita con un sacco di spazio anche per i bagagli.  Due chiacchiere su  Boston sono il valore aggiunto di Giovanni che ti fanno sentire un pò meno turista e più un viaggiatore !"
9117009,72788249,2016-05-04,8673219,Kelly,Gio was very understanding despite my arrival issues! The apartment was spotless and really nicely decorated! Even better than the photos :)
9117009,74767736,2016-05-16,16838500,Leslie,"\"Giovanni met us at the door to the building and was very helpful getting us and our bags up the very steep stairs to the second floor apartment.  He made us a list of restaurants he recommended, and reiterated that the neighborhood was safe for walking around at night (and told us where NOT to go, too, which was appreciated).  He offered us coffee for the morning, and use of the kitchen as well.    We spent time together talking and getting to know the area, before he had to leave.  My husband is a firefighter and was surprised to see the table lamps with do-it-yourself lampshades of paper shopping bags resting on bare lightbulbs (I can see them now in the host's photos, but didn't notice them prior to booking).  There were carbon monoxide and smoke detectors in the room and apartment, though, which was good.  There were incense and fragrant candles burning all over the apartment - and it turned out that my husband had an allergic reaction to all the scent.  We booked two nights, but chose to make other arrangements for the second night, due in part to the very noisy activity of the city on a Saturday night (unending sirens, cars racing by as they left their fun at the North End establishments, loud groups of people walking by after partying, etc.)  The apartment is on a very narrow street of apartment buildings, and, like a canyon, every noise echoed...  We live in a small town, and this was \"\"too much city\"\" for us.  Giovanni generously offered to switch bedrooms"
We loved the proximity to the North End of Boston,the Freedom Trail,etc.  Paul Revere's house and the North Church were just a couple of blocks from the apartment!  We could walk anywhere very easily,and felt safe doing so.  The restaurants in the area all looked and smelled so wonderful,and we ate excellent cannoli from Mike's Pastries.  We bought tickets for the Old Towne Trolley,a hop on-hop off trolley (with a couple of great guides) that went all over historic Boston so getting around was fairly easy.
In the end we spent the second night at a hotel - we don't want a refund,it was our choice to move.   Thank you,"Giovanni!\"",,,
9117009,74921742,2016-05-17,33067946,Diana,The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9117009,75926831,2016-05-23,26969912,Paul,"Gio was great to work with before and  on my arrival.   He texted me in the am before my flight and made me feel welcome.  I arrived 30 minutes early, and he quickly rushed to meet me at the door.  The room was exactly as described and is in a great location.   Minutes from the best Northend streets; Hannover and Salem."
9117009,76707546,2016-05-29,71000622,Lisa,Giovanni was a fantastic and gracious host! His apartment was absolutely perfect and he made my stay so much better. I was in Boston under sad circumstances due to a medical emergency with my Mom and I could not have chosen a better host and place!! THANK YOU Gio!!
9117009,76906702,2016-05-29,16459121,Kelly,"Overall a good stay, Giovanni is very nice and a kind host. The room looks exactly as describe and in a great location. A tad of a problem with the temperature of the room but Giovanni provide us with the AC unit which we took care of it."
One small note - if you are sensitive (allergic) to cigarette smoke,I would ask and confirm if smoking is allowed by anyone in the apt,including him and his guests. We step inside our room and it does smell like someone just finished smoking in there.,,,
"Other than that the place is great and Giovanni is great.\"",,,,,
9117009,78225530,2016-06-05,70138619,Ryan,I had an excellent experience in Boston and a lot of that has to do with the convenience of Gio's apartment. It doesn't get much better location-wise. Would definitely book again!
9117009,81090507,2016-06-20,20976400,Dan,The location in the north end is very convenient to the rail stations and lots of good restaurants and I felt very safe walking around at night. Giovanni is friendly and quiet at nights so you can get some sleep.  I didn't have any noise issues at this location but I also brought earplugs.  The photos represent what you are getting well.
9117009,82997899,2016-06-30,102747,Michael,"Giovanni is a great host.  His place is in a great location.  Nothing fancy, but the room is great."
9117009,83545904,2016-07-03,28139067,Ann,"Giovanni is a great and kind host. The place is really warm and clean and the location is convenient. There are lots of great restaurants around. The room looks exactly as describe. After all, it was a great experience in Boston!"
9117009,85002941,2016-07-10,33944292,Lisa,"We really enjoyed our stay. Giovanni was helpful, but also made an effort to give us our own space. The room and location was great!"
9117009,85896041,2016-07-13,2755461,Cun,"My wife and I had a great experience staying in Gio's place. Gio is very easy-going and friendly host that takes care of everything. His place is also perfect in terms of location, cleanness and condition. Within the Italian area, his place is in walking distance to Quincy's market, freedom trail and many other interesting places. I will definitely recommend his place to anyone that wants to explore the Boston city."
9117009,86465848,2016-07-16,29537358,Ryan,Gio was a kinda host. Great location and able to walk pretty much anywhere in Boston. Wifi worked great and so did the AC unit in the room. The rest of the apt does not seem to have AC. Water was hot but the place could have been a little cleaner.
9117009,87178171,2016-07-18,70882840,Yao Yen,Gio was the best! Very welcoming and accommodating especially in terms of arranging the pick-up for his apartment keys. Accommodation was neat and cosy and definitely as described in the host's listing page. Perfect location for exploring little Italy and for food hunting in Faneuil hall etc etc. Would recommend to visitors particularly those wanting to explore the Freedom Trail.
"If you have large luggage it might be tricky to navigate the tiny stairs up to the apartment but overall a fantastic place to stay! Thanks Gio!\"",,,,,
9117009,88392312,2016-07-24,25874066,Alix,"First arriving to Boston, Giovanni was immediately helpful with my bags with a warm and excited face. Very helpful and suggested a great spot to eat! The room was pretty spacious as well as clean and neat! Love the walk in extra closet.The location is top notch and easily accessible to get around anywhere in Boston."
9117009,89271791,2016-07-27,31867932,Maryann,"Excellent. Room was cozy. Comfortable bed. Helpful host. He left brochures to help you explore Boston and answered questions. I was especially grateful that even though my checkout time was 11 am, the host allowed me to store my bag in the house until later that evening so I wouldn't need to lug my backpack around the city. (He had guests coming in after me that day) I was afraid I'd be backpacking with a heavy luggage around the city all day before heading to the airport."
9117009,89753069,2016-07-29,80899257,Elaine,"We were able to drop off our bags earlier in the day and Giovani was very accommodating with that.  We, unfortunately, did not meet Giovani in person during our stay, but he was very prompt in communicating via text and letting his friend know of our requests and she was very helpful then, too. She speaks Italian and understood some of the English language and was very sweet and welcoming.  We felt very comfortable staying at Giovani's place.  They respected our privacy and I hope they felt the same about me and my daughter.  Overall a very good experience.  Loved the neighborhood.  Lots of great Italian restaurants and bakeries and small cafes for breakfast.  We would stay at Giovani's place again if we're ever in Boston.  Just be prepared for tight living spaces.  They really pack 'em in in Boston neighborhoods."

9117009,97549083,2016-08-27,52862466,Tommy,Gio's place was FANTASTIC.  The location could not have been any better and he made us feel as if we were family in his home. It was an amazing stay that offered us a genuine experience of the North End / Little Italy. We will most definitely stay here when we visit Boston again.
9117009,98347721,2016-08-30,24734327,Heather,"Giovanni and his girlfriend provided a really warm and inviting atmosphere. His communication was great, and the room is as described. Location was perfect and I could walk to the Salem Ferry (one of my day trips). It was during the Feast of St Anthony's that I stayed and it was a lot of fun to be able to walk down to the feast at night and enjoy in the festivities."
9117009,98762525,2016-09-01,22891690,Kelsey,"Perfect location in the North End! Gio was a great host, and the apartment was very clean and comfortable. I wish we could have stayed longer."
9117009,99953186,2016-09-06,82299688,Mindy,Gio has the BEST location for visiting the North End. We were able to leisurely walk to each attraction on our list. He is literally right around the corner from everything! Gio was such a warm host and welcomed us into his home...we will plan to stay there again when visiting the area...thank you!

12630619,87276858,2016-07-19,62051017,Kate,"This was a perfect spot for us as we were going to a concert at Fenway. An went over and above by not only granting us an early check in but by notifying us when we were en route that, as it turned out, we could check in even earlier. As we had flown overnight, this was a great bonus for us . It ensured a great evening event at Fenway as we were able to go straight to the apartment and rest.  The apartment was clean, inviting, attractive and comfortable. The nice natural light made it feel like home. The air conditioning was already on when we arrived. We liked the plush and clean towels. A perfect start to our vacation. Thanks, An!"

The apt has two air conditions that cooled both the living rooms and bedroom. Bed was super comfortable. Although we didn't use it, the extra bed in the living room is a real plus if you've got three people in your group."
"Parking is free on the street 8pm-8am which was great. 4 hour meter parking during the day. It is a third floor walk-up so it was a little tough on the knees. Neighborhood is very quiet. \"",,,,,

12630619,96006558,2016-08-21,32511918,Silas,"This was the perfect location for myself and my party to enjoy the area around Fenway for a weekend. The place was clean and well furnished, and An even left an air mattress to sleep on instead of the couch! I would definitely stay here again if I ever find myself needing an AirBNB in Boston."
7514336,79082965,2016-06-11,11390216,Steven,The apartment was small but clean and very well located. Everything was as expected. Alicia from the company renting this unit was very responsive.
Used this place for a business trip to office son nearby Beacon Street and it was very convenient. Totally Only issue and this is easy to overcome: You must bring your own toilet paper,"as they only promised us 1 \"\"complimentary roll\"\" for the four night stay.\"",,,,
1115394,6142334,2013-07-31,7512296,Jaclyn,"Meghan and her sweet dog, Wally, were wonderful hosts! Bedroom has a separate entrance from the outside and is very private and well-appointed. The apartment is in a great neighborhood within walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants, and public transportation. We had a car and street parking was also no problem. We felt completely at home in Meghan's airy, bright, and gorgeous apartment. She even made coffee for us in the morning! We are cat people but have to say hanging out with Wally was pretty awesome. He is a very sweet and lovable dog. If you love dogs stay here and if you are wary because there is a dog, don't be!"
1115394,6314660,2013-08-07,7800363,Aminah,"I have never hung out in Jamaica Plains before, but Meghans house was perfect location. Walking distance to the T and many other shops. We had breakfast at the Cantos 6, which had excellent food, and also if you are around you have to try the burger at the Haven restaurant ( my food recommendations). I wished I had met Meghan,we got in quite late, and left the next day, but the house is gorgeous, probably one of the cutest apartments I have even been in. If I am ever around the area again, I would definitely stay there. I was very comfortable, it felt like home."
1115394,6438878,2013-08-12,3866237,Billie,"Meg's place is lovely--a beautiful home that she keeps spotless in a cute neighborhood about two blocks from the train. The location is really convenient, a 15-20 minute train ride into the heart of Boston."
The room is private and bright and clean,with a private entrance,and the house and neighborhood are both quiet (which we loved). The price was well worth the accommodations,it's a great bargain.,,
Be sure to check out the awesome bakery between the house and the train that Meg told us about,Canto 6. The sandwiches and pastries are delicious. Meg herself is so sweet and a great host,we had a nice time hanging out and chatting with her and Wally.,,,
"\"",,,,,
1115394,6568394,2013-08-17,3102428,Thierry,"Meghan was a great host who made us feel very welcome in her lovely apartment. Her dog Wally is the coolest (doesn't bark and very calm). The apartment is very close to the orange line (Green street station if I recall correctly) and is about 6-7 minutes away from Center street. It stands in a interesting neighborhood close to a nice bakery. Plus, Meghan loves The Daily Show, so we couldn't ask for more."
1115394,6693173,2013-08-21,7651860,Géraldine,"My friend and I had a great time in Boston with Meghan. We were there without a car, but access to the metro station and downtown was very easy and we really enjoyed the fact that the house was a little bit out of town in a quiet neighborhood. The apartment itself is an interior designer's dream: it is so beautifully furnished that every day you discover new small beautiful details and you can enjoy a good meal (prepared in the great kitchen with all the amenities you need) on one of the sunny porches."
Our room had beautiful blue walls,a very comfortable bed and a cozy lamp,and sharing the bathroom was no problem at all. Meghan and her dog were great hosts,she was so nice and helped us with everything.,,
We really recommend Meghan's place,"we felt like home inmediately! Thank you so much!\"",,,,

Additionally,there is much within walking distance (Jamaica Pond,Franklin Zoo,and Franklin Park just to name a few).,,
Wally the Dog is a sweetheart.  If you're planning to go to Boston,"go meet Meg and Wally!\"",,,,

1115394,8293043,2013-10-24,4139082,Bernhard,We had a wonderful time at Meg's place where we stayed for 3 weeks. The room itself was small but totally fine and we could use the whole apartment and that was huge!
Meg herself is a perfect host,we directly felt like home and were happy to get some good advice about stores,restaurants,etc.,,
We really enjoyed the conversations that we all had together in the evenings and would be happy to see Meg and her dog Wally again!,,,,,
"We give Meg 6 out of 5 stars :-)\"",,,,,
1115394,8503546,2013-11-03,9176326,Charlene,"My 5-night stay with Meg was overall fantastic. This was my first AirBnB stay and it has set the bar high for any future AirBnB experiences.  For 3 of the 5 nights, it was me +1.  First off, Meg's apartment is lovely and charming.  What you see in the pictures is what you'll experience upon arrival.  The bedroom was updated with some additional decorative items and accents that you don't see in the photo (including curtains, which adds more privacy and blocks out the natural light if you need it).  It was just the right size for 1 and sufficient for 2 guests. The bed was so comfortable.  If cleanliness is a big thing for you, this certainly met my expectations."
What made my entire stay enjoyable were the details: the extra cup of coffee Meg brews for you (and your +1); Wally (who is such a darling); great conversations with Meg the times we did cross paths; the view of the sunset from the dining room.  I didn't spend too much time in the apartment,but if you had to the place is so welcoming you'll feel just at home. I made a small quick breakfast of toast and jam every morning,so I didn't use the kitchen too much for cooking,although I hear you're certainly welcome to do so.  The details in the post are all on point. Walking up the 3 flights of stairs was not bad at all.  I took the T everyday,which was just a short 5 minute walk (or less). The detail about the bakery/cafe Canto 6 is absolutely true! I made several stops there throughout my stay and the baked goods are divine,as are the sandwiches.
If you're new to AirBnB,I certainly recommend Meg's place. If you're a seasoned AirBnB guest,"I would absolutely recommend this place as well. It's just the right balance between a home away from home with added charm.  I would stay again in a heartbeat! \"",,,

Comfy bed is the best thing we liked after a long walk tour in Boston.Meg is so nice to treat her guests and made us feel free in her house. Wally her dog is a cute and friendly dog. It's inconvenient to watch out our steps because it is located in 3rd floor that we had to carry on our luggage. Besides that, everything is good to stay in Meg's lovely house. I already missed her coffee now!"

I stayed with them for a week in November, and I have only good things to say about my experience. Meg is extremely kind and friendly, and makes you feel very welcome in her flat. I very much enjoyed chatting to her, and she has lots of interesting and funny tales. As for Wally, he is bloody fantastic. He is always pleased to see you, and is just an altogether swell guy! The flat itself is immaculate and stylish, and located a couple of minutes from the T on foot. There are loads of shops and restaurants in JP, which is about a 10 minute walk from Meg's place. The bedroom has its own entrance, and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. You will be hard pushed to find a better place to stay in Boston!"

Easy public transportation access, which is convenient, because the apartment is not so close to city center and way to far to walk there. All in all, I had a pleasent stay."
1115394,10392447,2014-02-17,11548711,Mindy,"I can't recommend Meghan and Wally enough. Theirs is a beautiful, warm and welcoming home, in a great location. A short walk to the center of Jamaica Plain, and with all the luxuries of home provided by Meghan, anyone would be comfortable staying here. Coming in after a snow storm, Meghan even made us tea to warm ourselves up. There's plenty of street parking outside the apartment and the separate entrance is great - especially if you'll be coming in late. Meghan provided clean towels and soap, and your own shelf in the bathroom, and fresh water by the bed - Meghan thought of everything. The bed is comfortable and the room is a great size for two. Plus Wally when he wants to come say hi :)"

"Thanks Meghan! I will miss you and Wally! \"",,,,,

1115394,12108041,2014-04-23,8870366,Jason & Sari,Meg was a fantastic host. She was very helpful and accommodating. The location of the flat is perfect and nestled right in a very chic neighborhood. It was our first trip to Boston and won't be our last. We hope to stay here again next time.
1115394,12461001,2014-05-03,13369795,Soomin,"This place is just so nice and looks exactly the same as picture. I wish I was able to meet Meghan in person but me and my boyfriend were in tight schedule. I always loved Boston but staying in her apartment definitely gave me good sense of how living in Boston is. After the stay, I am just loving boston more. Thank you so much again for your warm hospitality and I would really love to go back to Meghan's place if i visit boston again."
1115394,12559340,2014-05-05,13972772,Caitlyn,"Meghan's place was exactly as pictured/described. Check-in and out was easy and stress free. There were a lot of cute touches such as a light breakfast, all of which were very nice. Although we never met face to face, I had a great experience with Meghan and would definitely recommend her."
1115394,12647611,2014-05-06,14682996,Marie-Pierre,"Meg est une personne très accueillante, son appartement est plein de charme, le quartier est très pittoresque (pour nous) et il est possible de se rendre au centre de Boston en 1/4 heure en train."
1115394,12850278,2014-05-12,14689426,Maxwell,This was our first airbnb experience and it was great. Meghan responded promptly to all emails. The apartment was very comfortable and the neighborhood was nice. There is a convenient orange line stop around the corner and lots of restaurants in the area. The apartment also had two wonderful porches!
1115394,12964821,2014-05-15,4924915,Tony,Great and comfortable place to stay. Even though the host was out of town she made sure that everything was perfect. You’ll love spending time there and you’ll want to come back again. Wally is the greatest dog. He was my favorite part of the trip. I already miss him! Highly recommended.
1115394,13067805,2014-05-19,8401806,Laura,"My parents enjoyed their time at Meghan's! She was very good at communicating and answering messages. Location was two blocks from the T slightly up hill, which was good exercise for my middle aged parents. Dog was friendly and didn't mind strangers. Thanks for hosting my parents!"
1115394,13154679,2014-05-20,2635626,Laurence,"Even tough our stay in Meghan's flat was short and sweet, we had time to fully appreciate the charm of it. Everything was very clean and beautiful. The neighborhood is amazing with all the blooming flowers and the big trees. Meg is an excellent caring host. I would definitely recommend this cosy nest and also the bakery just around the corner, hehe Thanks again! ☺"
1115394,13500221,2014-05-29,11077698,Julie,We loved our stay at Meg's! She was very easy going and sweet! We loved chatting with her and getting to know her as well as spend time in her beautiful home! As other reviewers mentioned her home is close to the train station and restaurants in Jamaica Plains. Meg was kind enough to spend time suggesting places to see and eat around Boston! The house had everything we needed with the bonus of the sweetest dog! We will miss both Meg and Wally! If we get the chance to visit Boston again someday we hope we have the opportunity to stay at Meg's!!
1115394,13617424,2014-06-01,2099252,Calum,"Meg was an incredibly welcoming and helpful host - and kind enough to spend an evening with us and share a bottle of wine. Her apartment is lovely too - full of beautiful objects and artwork, great balcony areas, with a very comfortable bed to boot.  Would highly recommend Meg and her apartment to anyone looking to stay in this area."
1115394,13796273,2014-06-04,15496749,Tricia,Meghan was an awesome host and staying in her home while in Boston was an absolute pleasure.  Her home is filled with beautiful objects and art which makes it a charming and welcoming space.  She also thought of every detail to make our stay as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.  From the simple light breakfast and coffee she set out for us in the morning to suggestions on places that we should visit ....everything was perfect!
1115394,13956197,2014-06-09,336483,Nic And Ben,"Meg was a fantastic host, and is my new buddy in Boston! She is very accommodating, takes pride in her home and allowed me to have plenty of space to recover from some pretty severe jet-lag. I enjoyed our chats on the verandah and playing with the super cool Mr Wally (Meg's little dog)."
"I highly recommend staying with Meg if you want to experience a gorgeous home and lovely host in JP.\"",,,,,
1115394,14194227,2014-06-14,6583454,Lia,"This was the perfect place to spend a few days before we could move into our nearby house in JP.  Street parking was always easy, walking distance to parks and a couple of cute lunch spots.  Meg's pup, Wally, was an added bonus!  Such a sweet and low-maintenance dog!  Meg was a fantastic and fun host, we hope to stay friends since we will be neighbors!"
1115394,14613820,2014-06-23,5262639,Marie,Great and clean room in a beautiful apartment. Meghan was very welcoming! It's not in the center but very close to a subway station.
1115394,14821475,2014-06-27,1882279,Chloë,"Meg's place has everything you want from a trip to Boston - a terrific and super-lovely host, a T station ten minutes away, ample air conditioning and a beautiful flat to relax in after a busy day. Also, there's Wally the schnauzer, who's so charming he could broker peace treaties. JP is a great neighbourhood, there are loads of cute cafes and good food places within walking distance, and it's very pretty. I only wish I could have stayed longer / forever."
1115394,14965043,2014-06-30,639935,Lydia,We had a wonderful stay with Megan and Wally. We were fortunate to meet Megan  when we arrived and had a nice chat while we were having breakfast out on her lovely  deck the next morning. The room and bed is comfortable and the bathroom was clean and conveniently located next to the room. Location is also very convenient for the T station and btw there is a lovely bakery just down the  road. Also a relly nice walk to the lively restaurant area. Highly recommend Megan's home to anyone visiting the Boston area.
1115394,15100574,2014-07-02,12359466,Ségolène,"Très bon logement, très propre, calme. Meghan a été d'une discrétion incroyable, qui laisserai planer le doute sur le fait qu'elle habitait ici."
Un délicieux petit déjeuner nous attendait tous les matins (café très bon et pain brioché avec vrai beurre et confiture!). Bref,"nous reviendrons avec plaisir si l'occasion se présente.\"",,,,
1115394,15399643,2014-07-08,15095171,Kathleen,"I didn't have a chance to meet Meghan since she was away during my stay, but she was still accessible through text in case I needed anything. Any time we communicated her response was quick and helpful. Her home was mesmerizing, clean, and had two beautiful spaces to sit outside on the perfect 70 degree days.  Not to mention the bed was so comfy I had a hard time leaving it.  Her attention to detail also made the stay feel much more welcoming, as you can clearly tell she puts a lot of thought into making the guest feel at home.  I would recommend her to anyone."
1115394,15626608,2014-07-13,15276902,Carlos,"Meghan is a great host. She accomodated me and my sister very well and made us feel like the house was ours. She also has a great place, with lots of light and an interesting decoration. The neighborhood is also very particular, it has a mixture of people and scenery. Lots of trees, very distinctive. She also has a very lazy dog named Wally which is pretty funny. It is impossible not to like what her place has to offer."
1115394,15690388,2014-07-14,334583,Sophy,"Meghan's place is great! Although we never met, Meghan was very good to deal with, her communication was friendly and polite and the room/house was exactly as it is described. The house is in a nice quaint neighbourhood and very handy to the trains and local shops etc. We only stayed one night but we would definitely stay at Meghan's again and would have no hesitation in recommending her to others. A great host with a great house! Top stay - Thanks Meg!"

1115394,16204512,2014-07-23,15361751,Sam,Upon arriving from our train from NYC  and dragging our luggage up the small (but felt like a mountain at the time) hill our first thoughts were 3 flights of stairs really?!
Make sure you climb those 3 flights of stairs,you are thoroughly rewarded with a beautiful space once up top.,,,,
The room itself was spacious,there was plenty of room for our two suitcases,a mirror,an air con,enough power sockets (important in this day and age) and the room had it's own entrance. We were greeted by Meg's cute puppy who came in to suss us out.,
Communicating with Meg was flawless prior to us arriving & during our stay,she answered my one hundred questions without frustration. We were lucky enough to get two of the last avail tix to the red sox and she gave us an easier way of getting to fenway. She leaves notes on the kitchen bench re: when she will be home/anything you need to know and has oj and coffee waiting for you. She is always happy to have a chat.,,,,
The bathroom was clean and not once were there issues with waiting to use etc (we have quite high standards for our bathrooms). The kitchen area is free to use for the times you do not want to eat out & there is a balcony for you to sit on if you feel like some fresh air,relaxation and sunshine.,,,,
The neighbourhood is safe. We walked the neighbourhood late at night and by ourselves and we never once felt unsafe or uncomfortable. It is a 5-10 min walk to the subway which is easy to use & will get you everywhere you need to go in boston-we even managed to make it out to Foxborough for gillette stadium/Pats place as a half day trip. The painters painting the building were always happy to have a chat and even helped us with out suitcases down the outside stairs.,,,,,
All in all a fabulous stay that made us feel like we were more at home than travelling the country/renting out a room which i'm sure added weight to the reason why i love boston and will be back.,,,,,
"Thanks meg!\"",,,,,
1115394,16478786,2014-07-28,16978087,Martin,Megs place is very cute and comfortable. Although we couldn't meet she organized the stay extremely well and I had no problem getting along. The location is convient to reach the Metro and the area is very green.
"Thank you!\"",,,,,
1115394,16827487,2014-08-03,14727370,Madeleine,"Meghan was a great host. Her home was beautiful and welcoming, the bedroom was comfortable, Wally (the dog) was great company, and waking up to coffee in the pot made getting out of her incredibly comfortable bed a little easier to do!  Meghan was also very accommodating and allowed us to leave some of our luggage at her home (which we GREATLY appreciated, thank you Meg) when we travelled to another location. The neighborhood is beautiful, and the location is very convenient; a quick walk to the train and you can be downtown in no time. We really enjoyed staying with Meghan and I would recommend that anyone travelling to Boston do the same!"
1115394,17291465,2014-08-10,17818426,Luisa,"Meg's place is lovely and homely. She was a great host, flexible and added little touches like having coffee ready for our arrival and leaving breakfast in the fridge. This was our first time using air bnb and I wouldn't hesitate to use it again if all hosts are like Meg!"
1115394,17495852,2014-08-13,10679682,Niklas,"Wir hatten einen perfekten Aufenthalt bei Meghan. Das Zimmer war groß, sauber und sehr schön eingerichtet. Es lief alles reibungslos und unkompliziert. Die U-Bahn ist sehr nah, was extrem angenehm ist. Um die Ecke befindet sich ein ziemlich cooles Restaurant, das Ten Tables, was wirklich sehr zu empfehlen ist. Bis in die Innenstadt ist es schon ein Stück, was aber durch die gute Anbindung in Ordnung ist."
"Thank you very much!\"",,,,,
1115394,17717693,2014-08-16,19417968,Makilou,Nous avons passés un superbe séjour à Boston! Nous étions à 10 minutes du centre ville de Boston ! L'endroit  était vraiment super confortable et très propre. Je le recommande sans hésitation.
1115394,17799109,2014-08-17,6673146,Dorsa,"We really enjoyed staying at Meghan's house. I loved all the decorations, I came home inspired to redecorate. Our room was comfy and the private entrance was a plus. We also LOVED Wally, the Schnauzer who greeted us upon arrival. Meghan was very communicative, accessible, and friendly. I would definitely recommend this space!"
1115394,17841370,2014-08-18,3938844,Florian,"I literally crashed on Meghan's place for the night - arriving late and leaving early in the morning. I did not even sleep much because of jetlag and only met Meghan briefly on her way out. However, she definitely made me feel welcome at her tastefully furnished place. I would stay there again."
1115394,18056581,2014-08-21,15149526,Amber,"This place was our best AirB&B experience yet! We felt so welcome and comfortable in Meghan's gorgeously hip home and she is a truly wonderful host, we just couldn't have asked for more. Meghan gave us excellent tips on where to go and what to do in Boston and she nailed every single one - we had a ball. If you would like a clean and tidy, yet relaxed and hip place to stay in Boston I highly recommend this one! Also, the bed is incredibly comfortable and she has a very sweet and well behaved little dog. Thank you for all you did to make our stay so awesome :)"
1115394,18210305,2014-08-23,17718506,Tanguy,"L'acceuil était très satisfaisant, parfait pour une escapade de quelques jours à Boston."
1115394,19357421,2014-09-11,1876934,Hannah,"We had a wonderful stay in Meg's beautiful apartment and only wish we could have stayed a little longer. Meg wasn't there when we arrived but made it easy for us to get into the apartment and communicated really well. She was very welcoming and it was lovely to wake up to fresh coffee in the morning. We were very happy to meet Wally too, what a super cute and well behaved pooch!"
The location is great,"a really short walk to the T and easy to get around Boston from there. \"",,,,
1115394,19686749,2014-09-16,19755741,Jeffrey,"Meghan provided a great space for a first time Boston visitor, and first time AirBnB user. I arrived very late in the day, but our correspondence before my arrival had me ready to allow myself into the space and get situated. The room was waiting, light lit."
If you're a stranger to the area,and fortunate enough to cross paths with Meghan,she definitely has decent recommendations for ways to spend your day. As a bonus,travel into the thick of Boston and its shopping districts is readily available.,,
The home is excellent,Meghan a great host,and her dog friendly. There's as much or as little engagement as you need. It's the basics,"but in the best possible way.\"",,
1115394,21456597,2014-10-18,14305694,Joke,"I've stayed with Meghan and Wally for four weeks during my vacation in Boston. I couldn't have wished for a better host! The house was indeed comfy, the bedroom is spacious en Meghan is very comfortable to share the rest of the house with. I've had the best Bostonian experience thanks to Meghan and Wally ofcourse, the sweetest dog."
Although Jamaica Plain looks a bit far from the towncentre on a map,it's really easy to take the T (subway) to everywhere you wish to go. And the neighbourhood itself has a lot to offer as well. And if you have any questions,"Meghan is happy to help you and to make your experience as delightful as possible.\"",,,
1115394,21745585,2014-10-23,13399766,Max,"Meghan and Wally were great hosts. Either, the room and the rest of the apartment was just stunning and very clean. We would definitely recommend her place! Unfortunately, we haven't seen each other very often, but the communication via AirBnB was very uncomplicated and easy. :)"
1115394,21785741,2014-10-24,23106,Rachael,"We couldn't have imagined a better start to our trip. Meghan's home was a warm and inviting refuge from the nor'easter. Great neighborhood, great space, kind human, hilarious dog! Highly recommend a visit."
1115394,22016445,2014-10-28,20069029,Catherine,"Nous avons eu un magnifique séjour chez Meghan, qui nous a fait quelques suggestions pour visiter la ville à notre arrivée.  La chambre et le logement en général étaient très propres et joliment décorés. Nous avons peu exploré l'environnement immédiat, mais avons tout de même bien apprécié l'architecture et un bon petit café/boulangerie au coin de la rue. La distance de marche pour atteindre le métro est plutôt courte et le trajet vers le centre-ville se fait très facilement."
1115394,22374896,2014-11-04,22589282,Abby,Meghan was such an amazing host AND person!! She was very welcoming and open about things. Her space was very clean and lovely.

1115394,22708060,2014-11-12,2563346,Laurel,"Meghan is such a warm, engaging, and down-to-earth woman that it felt like we were staying with an old friend. She was always up for some good, relaxing conversation, and she offered to make us coffee and oatmeal each morning! On a more personal level, she gave me so much valuable advice for my pursuit of a graduate program, which I appreciated immensely. And Wally always pranced into the room to greet us each morning! My partner, Anthony, and I could not have asked for more lovely and welcoming hosts."
The room was SO cozy,and the entire apartment was just immaculate. I completely fell in love with all of Jamaica Plain's unique charm while I was there,"so I can't recommend staying with Meghan highly enough. ...The only problem is you won't want to leave. :) \"",,,
1115394,22892479,2014-11-17,8817625,Andrew,"Meghan was a fantastic host for our first AirBnb stay. The room was immaculate, the bed comfortable and the flat was cosy and stylish. Meg had some great suggestions for things to do in Boston and was super friendly, as was her awesome dog Wally!"

1115394,23326676,2014-11-29,5062435,Bill,"Meghan's comfy room is every bit that!  The bed, pillows, and cozy comforter were perfect after a long, snowy trip; the shower was what I hope to find in a high-end spa, and the coffee was perfect.  Her home is only a block from an amazing bakery, and also easy walking distance to several other cafe's and restaurants, as well as a quick walk to the Orange Line of the T - system for a trip downtown.   Meghan was welcoming and very friendly and made me feel right at home. I will definitely stay here again."
1115394,23466636,2014-12-01,9911155,Robin,Very nice flat. Good breakfast. Room is very comfortable.
1115394,23589102,2014-12-05,6116204,Clark,"I booked a room at Meghan's condo for my husband who had a late work night and very early morning afterwards.  He arrived late in the evening, and was back out very early, so he didn't do much besides fall into bed and jump out in the morning. Everything was fine and comfortable, and Meghan was very good at communicating with us about the details.  I am sure he would do it again."

The room was very cozy with a separate entrance than the rest of the apartment and had the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in!

She was accessible via text, and responded quickly. I slept peacefully, and woke up to a note from Meghan who left me a cup & coffee still in the pot. Great place to catch up on some sleep! Thank you Meghan!"

1115394,24709450,2015-01-02,864370,Mick & Heidi,"Meghan's home is a wonderful relaxing oasis. Their guest room has a private entrance so your actually very private. We even didn't bump into her dog Wallie or her boyfriend funny enough. Meghan clearly has a great eye for home decor and design which makes her place an inspiring home to stay. Location is great as the Orange subway line is only 5 mins walk away. JP is a great hood and feels a little like Williamsburg, Brooklyn."

Meghan was flexible with our check-in and check-out time, which I really appreciate and parking was, as she said, easy to find. Arranging our stay in the apartment was extremely easy and quick. Sadly I didn’t get to meet her since I was there just for two nights. I would definitely stay at Meghan’s again."

I spent most of the day exploring Boston but was able to work on my school stuff when I was there. I very much appreciated the coffee she left in the morning! I would definitely recommend staying at Meghan's & consider her first before looking elsewhere. Her place is just like the photos. I loved it!

1115394,26682358,2015-02-17,11052836,Heather,"We loved staying at Meghan's place in JP! She messaged us a few days in advance to let us know how we could obtain the keys, and her instructions were clear and easy to follow. She was home when we arrived, and she was very friendly and pleasant and offered great advice about where to eat in the area. The house itself was very close to an Orange Line station and easy to find. Meg's dog is a sweetheart and is very well-behaved; we were thrilled to have him around. The bedroom has a separate entrance which is handy, and although we were there during extremely cold weather, the bedroom stayed nice and toasty. Meg was kind enough to make us coffee in the morning and she let us use her kitchen to make a pancake breakfast when we were snowed in during the blizzard! Although the weather conditions made it tough to get around by transit/on the roads, we found that there were plenty of places to eat and drink within walking distance, even in the snow. If we come back to Boston, we would happily stay here again and we would recommend Meg and her beautifully decorated home without hesitation!"

1115394,27846975,2015-03-13,9930344,Sinead,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Meghan's place for one night and it was a perfect fit. The location was perfect for us- close to the T to get downtown and close to the sam Adam's brewery (which has an awesome free tour). Also, the bed was really comfortable and wally, the dog, was very welcoming and cute. We did not meet Meghan in person but she was quick to respond to all our messages and gave very clear instructions for check in (and left us some coffee in the morning which was lovely). Overall Meghan's place was great spot to base our short trip out of."
1115394,28091705,2015-03-17,25935127,Deborah,"Meg's home is absolutely wonderful.  I didn't sped much time there as I was in and out visiting my daughter but felt completely comfortable while I was there.  It was so nice to be in a home environment instead of a hotel.  The bed was super comfortable, plenty of hot water for showering, fantastic coffee, and great little touches that shows Meg cares about hers guests.  My favorite was the new pair of slippers.  I always forget to pack them and it was perfect.  When you do have the time to chat with Meg she is great.  The check in/out process was so simple.  All in all it was a great first AirBnB experience for me!"
1115394,28408509,2015-03-23,4350802,Betsi,"We had a wonderful time staying at Meghan's place while visiting Boston. It was comfy with a great bed and had all the amenities that a traveler would need, even morning coffee and bedroom slippers! If I come back to Boston again I will surely stay with Meghan. She was super helpful about the neighborhood and general Boston things. We had fun chatting with her and playing with her cute dog Walley too."
1115394,28572393,2015-03-26,26814142,Mengfan,"Her home is great and Meghan was welcoming. Moshe tried to help us everything she can. She bought us some tea bags because the first night we were trying to find some. Wally the dog was sweet. Also, the Orange line is just 2 blocks away, which is convenient. Overall it is a wonderful experience living there."
1115394,28743458,2015-03-29,29403956,Jorge,Meghan made very easy my short trip to Boston. Previously to my arrival we were in permanent contact with check in info and the way to get there.
The room was great and she prepared all the details to make it comfortable. Even an umbrella was ready,at my door,in a rainy day.,,,
The house is very nice,modern and you feel like being in your own home.,,,,

Her set up makes it easy to arrive if she isn't home and her place is very nice.  The location is any shot off the highway and it is a great walk-able area.  Meghan has a warm and inviting personality, and it was nice chatting with her.  Mr. Wally, her dog, was a well behaved little gentleman.  If I ever have to stay in Boston again, she is my preferred host.   Thank you Meghan for opening your home to me!"
1115394,30029399,2015-04-16,19547735,Ornella,We had a wonderful stay at Meghan's apartment. The room and the apartment are nice and Meghan was very very welcoming. The atmosphere was very calm and romantic. The neighborhood is nice too and it is easy to get to the city center. Breakfast at nearby café was great too. I would absolutely recommend staying at Meghan's place!
1115394,30801178,2015-04-27,24021355,Renee,"We absolutely adored Meg's place. So much so that I took pics for tips on how to decorate my own apartment. Meg's AirB&b was by far the BEST we've ever stayed. The directions were very straight forward and it was easy to find. I loved that the room had its own entrance from the outside (I've never seen that before). It allowed for a little extra privacy which is always nice. Meg couldn't have been more accommodating. She had a cantons of water waiting for us on our nightstand. There were two umbrellas outside the front door. The room had the most comfortable bed with four soft pillows, a duvet and even a nice throw blanket. Directs for the wifi were nicely printed and put in a frame on our nightstand. When we woke up each morning, Meg had coffee ready for us ms two mugs with a note. She went above and beyond what I would ever expect from an AirB&b host. She was friendly, easy going, and an all around sweet person. I thought Meg's apartment was tastefully decorated, very clean and I fell in love, love, love with her dog Wally. He was such a doll.  We will definitely stay with Meg the next time we are in Boston. Best AirB&b EVER!!"
1115394,31015081,2015-04-30,5861502,Marisa,"Our experience at Meghan's apartment was perfect! The apartment was just as great as described and as the pictures show. The T (subway/metro) was literally two blocks away and on the way Canto 6 is the perfect place to pick up your morning breakfast and caffeine. Meghan was a great host, even though our schedules never met up and we never met Meghan, communicating with her was easy. Meghan left clear instructions so we could arrive at our leisure, her dog, Wally, will steal your heart if you let him, and the bed was so comfortable we caught ourselves wanting to snooze the alarm everyday. I would highly recommend Meghan's room/apartment and I would definitely stay again whenever I return to Boston!"

1115394,31533187,2015-05-06,2977888,Jacqueline,"Meghan's house is absolutely beautiful. It is a little climb up the stairs, but it will be worth it! She is so easy to talk to and will answer all your questions and/or give you tips around the city if you need. The bed was very comfy and her pup is ADORABLE! The station is a short walk down, and it wasn't a problem at all getting to the city. A good place to stay :)"

Even though our schedule never met she always answered our question and made sure we felt at home. We thought it was a nice gesture to make coffee in the morning and put a jug of water in our room. Her dog Wally is calm and a real gentlemen. The house is located on a charming street and the beautiful neirghborhood of JP. It is also walk distance to the train station and a great coffee shop Canto 6. We had a great time in boston and highly recommend this place!"
1115394,35199902,2015-06-16,9841480,Paula,My fiancee and I stayed at Meghan's place this past weekend. The room is clean and comfortable and was great for what we needed. We were running around to and from wedding events from the time we arrived in Boston on early Saturday afternoon until when we left early Monday morning so we didn't have much to check out the neighborhood or spend time in the apartment. We didn't meet Meghan or her dog- it seems we had the apartment to ourselves for the little time we were there.  It was easy to get to on public transportation and seemed well located.
1115394,35566474,2015-06-20,27779653,Natalie,Meghan was a great host. Her apartment is absolutely lovely. We really enjoyed staying there!

Cependant,nous avons souvent communiqué par messages interposés,Meghan fut très réactive.,,,
La chambre est simple et propre,le plus est la porte qui donne un accès privé à sa chambre mais en contre partie cela ne donne pas l'impression d'etre chez quelqu'un et facilité un éventuel échange avec la personne qui accueil.,,,,
Le quartier : au début je trouvais cela logement un peu loin du T mais en fait pas du tout,c'est meme très pratique la ligne Orange est très centrale et rapide.,,,,
Café : Canto 6,très bien et très bon pour commencé la journée. J'ai trouvé les viennoiseries un peu cher tout de même mais bon quand on vient de France forcement on est plus difficile...,,,,

We especially appreciated the coffee the host left for us in the morning, its a great way to start the day. We also enjoyed Wally the dog's company! Highly recommended. Although be warned, it is at the top of 3 flights of stairs so if you have a large suitcase or are less mobile, this may be a consideration you need to make. But for us, it was perfect."

There was a bottle of water + glasses waiting for us when we arrived plus perfect introduction instructions. On her arrival home from work, Meghan kindly set us up to use the common laundry facilities in the basement - this was a life saver!!"
For sightseeing,we could easily catch the orange line into town for $2.65 p/single trip and took about 30mins (inc walking to the station). We really liked the JP area - quiet and relaxing - and the locals outgoing and helpful. The nearest shops are a couple of blocks aways but it's a more than manageable walk. Be sure to try JP Licks,frequent the local bakeries and walk in the Arboretum.,,,
We really enjoyed chatting with Meghan. She was really friendly and more than happy to help. And then there's Wally. He's adorable,"well behaved and missed already.\"",,,,

Her home is in a great location, 5 minutes walk from the metro station on the orange line which took us to everywhere we needed to go. It was easy to get to and from even with our suitcases. Her apartment is so beautiful and clean just as pictured."
Meghan herself was a really lovely person when we did get to meet her and Wally was such a sweetie! On our last morning my friend injured herself in the kitchen. It was an awkward and hilarious situation,and we were panicking a bit but she was very cool about it and helped us tend to the wound and to grab a first aid kit.

We didn't have the pleasure of meeting her as we would get in late and leave early in the morning each day we stayed there. The room we stayed at was ready for us when we arrived and the bed was super comfortable. There were absolutely no problems and I definitely recommend it.
1115394,71604301,2016-04-26,35168700,Cat,"Meghan's house was so nice!! So accessible from the train station. I slept comfortably as the room and bed was spacious. The dog was so cute as well!! overall,"
"I loved my stay! The stairs going up is not as tiring as I thought it would be. \"",,,,,
1115394,72018272,2016-04-30,980485,Patti,"Cute apartment, friendly host."
1115394,72841811,2016-05-04,35320346,Paul,Great comfy room with ample on street parking. Meghan has all the necessities available with clear instructions.
1115394,73325798,2016-05-08,62107496,Tajette,"She gave really good instruction on what to expect, and how to get into the house.  The pictures are exactly how the space looks.  Very nice and clean place.  We never saw her, but the instructions and everything was very easy.  Very nice place, and I would recommend it to someone for sure."
1115394,74029669,2016-05-12,65240268,Anna,Me and my mom had the most wonderful stay at Meghan's place.
The house is beautiful,tastefully decorated,sunny and airy.,,,
We had a large comfortable bed in a cozy blue room. The whole place was really clean and smelled delicious.,,,,,
Meghan was both welcoming and discreet. Since she left early for work it almost felt like we had the apartment for ourselves.,,,,,
There are two big terraces where you can enjoy a quiet moment in the sun with a view on JP Hills.,,,,,
I loved the place so much that I stayed an extra night !,,,,,
"I would really highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to go to Boston ! \"",,,,,
1115394,74313801,2016-05-14,15694038,Jonathan,"Meghan was the best! The room is clean and comfy, and we had such a good sleep! The bathroom had everything we needed, and share it with Meghan was no problem."
1115394,74898743,2016-05-17,16208718,Sarah,Nice flat and cosy room. Easy to access with the independant door. Meghan was nice. 20-25 min from the downtown with Subway.
1115394,75417774,2016-05-21,66787869,Kelly,Staying with meg was a delight! Listing is exactly as described and just as adorable as it looks in the pictures. It's only a 5 min walk to the train as well as numerous cafes so the location is extremely convenient. Meg was super sweet and great to talk to and Wally was great and extremely well behaved!
1115394,75937137,2016-05-23,2233120,Mitch,"Had a great time in Boston in a great neighborhood. Meghan did a great job communicating the check-in process and everything was exactly as described. Did not get to meet Meghan, but she is a girl of impeccable style by the looks of her apartment. Bed was very comfortable. Room has it's own private entrance so you can have as much privacy as you desire. Meghan was among the most responsive hosts I have had, always responding promptly to messages. Great experience, great place, great neighborhood."
1115394,76351254,2016-05-26,6302957,Yumi,I really enjoyed staying at Meghan's stylish apartment. Meghan is a friendly host and communication with her is easy. The bed is very comfy and everything is clean and as described. Her apartment is less than 10 minutes walk to the T and from there it's an easy 20 minutes train ride to Boston. Super!
1115394,78644435,2016-06-08,7131656,Brianna,"Meghan's place was great! Though we never got to meet her, she was very responsive through messages, and we instantly felt at home. Her place is close to Sam Adam's and a T stop, and parking was really easy. I loved the decor on the inside, and the rooms were spacious and comfortable. Her dog is super cute too!!"
1115394,78877755,2016-06-09,20491879,Catherine,Meg was an excellent host! She was kind and very welcoming and made our experience staying with her easy and comfortable. Would definitely stay with again!
1115394,79524628,2016-06-13,69187205,Carmen,Meg's place is decorated very nicely. It is close to everything. Room has a private entrance. Her dog is so cute!
1115394,80098154,2016-06-16,22020792,Debra,Meg's house was great. Everything is very independent (which we prefer)! The room is very comfortable and all you would need for a weekend visit.
1115394,80439830,2016-06-18,14889344,Natasha,"We stayed at Meg's lovely place for two nights. The apartment is lovely and homely and the bed was very comfortable! Meg was very friendly, as was her gorgeous dog Wally who was undoubtedly one of the highlights of this stay. The apartment is easily accessed by the metro and we had no difficulty in getting around the city from the area which is very authentic Boston. Overall, thoroughly recommended!"
1115394,80844042,2016-06-20,53945318,Michiels,We stayed for 2 nights at Megan's place. The bed was comfortable and we liked the fact that the room had a private entrance. The apartment is beautifully furnished and super cosy. We also liked the neighbourhood.
Although we didn't meet Megan,she always answered very quickly whenever we had a question.,,,,
Wally,"her dog is the cutest dog ever I guess. \"",,,,
1115394,81416924,2016-06-22,74553996,Jing,"主人不是很热情,可能接待主客太多了吧。房间尚可,独立进出不错,但共用卫生间还是不太习惯,同时因为主人一直在家,也很难享用除了主人卧室以外的所有空间。照片里的主人房建议删掉,有误导嫌疑。"
1115394,82308991,2016-06-27,31357499,Caroline,"The room was amazing, near the bathroom with a private entrance directly in the room. We are 2 very shy girls and it was really easy and we felt comfortable right away!"
The parking on the street was also easy but you shouldn't have a big car since the street isn't really large. Subway walking distance with 2 bakeries on the way! Nice restaurant (bellaluna) near the appartment.,,,,,
The room was really quiet at night even if the AC was right next to the bed. We didn't even ear the dog!,,,,,
"The system in place to get the key was great so we could arrive when we wanted and no need to contact Meg (witch is nice since we are from Canada and didn't want to use our phones...) We would totally recommand!\"",,,,,
1115394,82750878,2016-06-29,8093968,Aurore,Private access to the room; clean and friendly welcome! It was Perfect for our stay! (A little bit far away from downtown).
1115394,84060242,2016-07-05,40546931,Pascale,We enjoyed our stay. The apartment was cute and clean (the private entrance is convenient). I recommended it!
1115394,84520167,2016-07-07,26074635,Alexandra,"Meg was a super friendly and helpful host and her place was great! Close to the T, right around the corner from a really good bakery and the room even has AC, which I was extremely thankful for since it happened to be 90 degrees when we were in town. Oh, and the bed was nice and fluffy and Meg's dog is also super cute. Definitely stay here if you're looking for a place in Boston! :)"
1115394,85155871,2016-07-10,28135170,Katherine,"Meg was a great host! We never actually met her, but she was great at communicating upon our arrival and throughout our stay. The neighborhood wasn't too far from the tourist activities we had planed and we felt safe at Meg's place. Overall is was a great experience!"
1115394,85940595,2016-07-14,15933207,Mareen,The room was cozy and clean as well as the wohle appartment. It's close to the metro station and easy to find. You need about 15 minutes to downtown. Megan was friendly and it wasn't an issue to check in late as our flight was delayed.
1115394,86529817,2016-07-16,32139686,Mareike,My stay with Meg was really good. It was a very hot Weekend and the AC made it very comfortable! The neighboorhood is very quiet & the metro is down the hill about 10 minutes to walk.
1115394,90509128,2016-08-01,6929111,Janine,Meg did a wonderful job welcoming us to her home. The room and bathroom were clean. She had a sign welcoming us and explaining where things were and the wifi information and password. She even set out a bottle of water and two glasses by the bedside. Everything was very clean and quiet. The bed was very comfortable too!
1115394,91328803,2016-08-04,35356468,Regina,"Meg's place is as comfy and nice as one could wish. I felt there ,at home' and I'm glad we stayed there. The neighborhood is quiet and the subway is close. Wally is the cutest dog, of course, and very patient with guests. Meg was very nice and helped us with everything we asked for. I think everybody who visits her will feel the same."
1115394,92016613,2016-08-07,76756254,April,I'm so glad we stayed here. It was a breeze getting to where we wanted to go arrive turn since the subway is only a 5 minute walk from the door steps. The room was more than sufficient (thank goodness for the air conditioning.) We only dwelled in our room and used the bathroom but the whole apartment was open to us if we needed it. The old wooden floors are extra creaky but fortunately for us we had the place to ourselves since Meg was on a business trip so it wasn't a problem. Even though we didn't get to meet our lovely host we were well taken care of. It is a third floor walk up so I'd keep that in mind if you a young one or have difficulty climbing them but otherwise it's very easy. I'd definitely stay here again!
1115394,92398121,2016-08-08,2748509,Samantha,La chambre se situe dans un appartement propre au 3eme étage. Elle possède une entrée privative. Proche métro qui amène au centre ville rapidement. Nous sommes restés 2 nuits et avons croisé Meghan juste à notre départ. Elle est très disponible si besoin.
1115394,93622244,2016-08-13,79094996,Hannah-Suzanne,Während unserer Zeit sind wir Meg nur zweimal kurz begegnet.
Das Haus liegt ruhig,"aber zentral. Die Wohnung ist sauber und gemütlich. Das Zimmer verfügt über einen eigenen Eingang. Das Bett war bequem. Die Küche sowie das Wohnzimmer durften in vollem Umfang mitgenutzt werden.\"",,,,
1115394,94447673,2016-08-15,31466991,MeiJuan,"Le stationnement sur la rue est très facile et il y a très peu de restrictions, donc accès facile à ce niveau. L'accès à la chambre est très bien, nous avions notre porte accédant à notre chambre. Il a fait très chaud lors de notre weekend à Boston et l'air climatisé et le ventilateur dans la chambre étaient parfaits et nous étions très confortables. Petit moins, le matelas a un creux dans le milieu et nous avions l'impression de glisser vers le centre,un peu moins agréable. Quelques déchets et saletés sous le lit comme un sac de plastique. Nous n'avions malheureusement plus de washclots à l'endroit où elle nous avait indiqué qu'il y a en avait. Drôle d'odeur dans l'appartement (nourriture à chien? couche à chien? l'humidité due à la chaleur accablante du weekend a probablement renforcé l'odeur dans tout l'appartement). 5 min à pied du métro , quartier sécuritaire. Communication facile avec l'hôte."
1115394,95620666,2016-08-20,77947220,Dario,"Meg was a great host, the check in process was smooth and easy. The room was exactly as described, and exactly what we needed for our stay in Boston."
1115394,96441313,2016-08-22,79359622,Rachel,Our host was very conscientious & emailed to make sure we arrived safely.  The place was clean and quiet.
1115394,97971185,2016-08-29,14009045,(EMAIL HIDDEN),"Very cute, and welcoming. Meg was extremely nice and helpful. It is outside of Boston and a bit of a walk up a hill to get to from the T station, but nothing terrible."
7620413,44965952,2015-08-30,26249396,Eric,"Thank you to Karen for accommodating my new hire who was relocating from Toronto.  He assured me that the apartment was spectacular, easy transitions in and out, and that it was well located for his commute and social activities."
Big thanks to Karen for working with me on a longer stay and ensuring everything went smoothly with the multiple parties.,,,,,

7620413,48535567,2015-09-27,35259332,Timothy,"Great experience! Stayed here for a month. Beautiful home. Clean, neat. Great location in South End. 25-30 minute walk to Longwood medical area. Many great restaurants within 10 min walking distance. Karen is attentive to any needs and lays out clear rules. Will not hesitate to stay here again when back in Boston. Wonderful experience."
6870485,35893157,2015-06-22,36169790,John,I 100% recommend staying at an Airbnb by Nathan. I got in super late and he was very understanding about it. I came down to apartment search in the area. The apartment was clean and quiet. I actually didn’t run into anyone during my time there. The pictures and description are accurate and the neighborhood was great. Thanks Nathan!
6870485,36342051,2015-06-27,36420522,Jeffrey,"Nathan was very accommodating and communicative throughout my stay. The street and neighborhood are quiet, and there are plenty of restaurants and bars just a few blocks away. The bed was comfortable, the house was clean, and my housemates were polite."
6870485,36730984,2015-06-30,30828492,Laury,"Nathan met me at the location and walked me through the property while kindly offering suggestions on restaurants and easy travel options to areas of Boston that I had mentioned that I was interested in seeing during my visit. He was quite informative and did not make me feel rushed as I had quite a few questions!  The neighborhood was quiet and there was a very short walk to the subway (less than five minutes.) I felt safe at all times and even met a few nearby neighbors. There is a roommate who is very friendly, quiet and considerate and I made sure I was the same. Next trip to Boston, I will return!"
6870485,41381216,2015-08-07,7092372,Dani,"Nathan's place was really nice, very convenient to reach Boston and Cambridge with the subway. It also comes with a large back porch; it was really good to relax out there in the evenings. Nathan was very friendly and welcoming too."
6870485,42209052,2015-08-11,39650194,Wilbert,Nathan is super friendly. The house is very close to the JFK/UMass T station and in general the neighborhood is quiet. I definitely recommend this as a very good option to stay in Boston.
6870485,43990585,2015-08-23,38453269,Junjie,"It was really nice and economy place to live in Boston, not so far from the City center, the room was clean and comfortable, Nathan is nice guy and he give me lots of tips in Boston, I  recommend to take this nice room for you"
6870485,85544946,2016-07-12,72383365,Kim,"Nathan met me upon arrival even though it was in the evening. Guests have a nice-sized room with a desk, full closet, and extremely comfortable bed. The kitchen is fully equipped and the living room provides a place to relax. Wifi available. The bathroom is immaculate and updated."
414419,1172741,2012-04-23,2155045,David,Great place at a great price from a great host. This studio is only a fifteen minute walk from Fenway and two minutes from Newbury street. It is perfect for anyone spending a weekend in Boston. You just need to be able to climb a ladder to get to the bed. If you are driving in parking can be a pain because parking on Beacon is restricted to Back Bay residents only.
414419,1280097,2012-05-14,2144927,Victoria,"Great apartment, small but cozy and on a gorgeous neighborhood very close to the city center (within walking distance). Ravi was very helpful, he shared some info about what to do/visit and Boston and it was ok for him for us to stay until 17pm on the day we were leaving the apartment. Highly recommended!"
414419,1329148,2012-05-22,1160748,Annie,Cozy apartment in a well located and charming neighborhood.
Close to major interest points (Boston Common,Boston Public Library,Commonwealth Avenue,Harvard Square) is accessible by walking distance. Ravi is a great host; answered our questions promptly. He is friendly,"was helpful and accommodating. Staying at his place made our stay in Boston even more special. I would definitely take his place again.\"",
414419,1366337,2012-05-28,2367749,Jessie,"Loved the apartment and the location was ideal!  Right off the Copley stop and walking distance to great shopping on Newbury Street as well as Fenway Stadium!  Additionally Ravi was also a fantastic host, super easy to communicate with and accommodating of our hectic schedule!"
414419,1467032,2012-06-12,1894133,Sanna,"Excellent location for an old house, shower/toilet opportunity was minimum which was little bit a shock for us, even that we were aware of it.. Old house has old houses problems, could you say. Minus was also that there was no wifi-connection, we had troubles with it in whole town."
"Host seemed very nice and dependable and Boston was great!\"",,,,,
414419,1491930,2012-06-16,2419192,Gilles,"Ravi was easy to communicate with, he gaves us some good ideas about the city. We loved the location: close to Copley subway stop and at a walking distance to Newbury Street(bar, restaurant & shops)"
"The apartment is cosy and you need to be able to climb a ladder to get to the bed (confortable)\"",,,,,
414419,1506839,2012-06-18,2417947,Miriam,Ravi's cute apartment is on a quiet street  (for exhausted travellers to get a good night's rest) but only two blocks away from the shopping and nightlife of Back Bay. Subway also only 2 blocks away. This spot is perfect.
414419,1548769,2012-06-24,2390688,Leah,"Ravi's place is quite lovely, comfortable, and a fantastic location. Highly recommended!"
414419,1581226,2012-06-28,2384089,Katrina,"Ravi's place is ideally located in the chi-chi area of the Back Bay! We felt incredibly safe and were able to walk anywhere we wanted to be in under 30 minutes! The apartment itself is a bit of an adventure - but that is to be expected in a very historical property. My balance was tested on the ladder going up to the bed in the loft - but the bed was very comfortable. This is an easy, super located space for someone who wants to explore Boston on a budget. And, Ravi himself was wonderful to deal with!"
414419,1611782,2012-07-02,2011067,Kathryn,"The location can't be beat! My boyfriend and I would stay there again in heart beat!  The studio is small, with a quirky bathroom, but you're a quick walk to all sorts of restaurants and shops, plus public transit. And Ravi is responsive, helpful and more than accommodating."
414419,1656490,2012-07-08,2061637,Marcus,"Ravi was proactive in helping me find and settle in to the apartment, and very helpful and responsive with all queries. The apartment was really well located, close to Newbury and Boylston Streets and within walking distance of South End, and Fenway Park, as well as Cambridge and Boston cities. A great stay all round."
414419,1690535,2012-07-12,2566241,Elaine,"The appartement is very well located and my boyfriend and I were nice welcomed by our host. The appartement is convenient and the bed is confortable. We find it noisy, as during the summer we wanted to sleep the windows open because there is no air conditionned. If you come by car, be aware that you can not park on the streets around and the parking is a bit expensive in Boston (it cost us 52$ for two days). It's nice to have a kitchenette in the condo, you can use the fridge and cook a couple of simple things. Our only concern, with the noise, is the bathroom, wich is very small and not renovated. The walls and the floor of are quiet rotten and there is even a hole in one of them. This was a surprise, as the appartment is great, confortable and nicely furnished."
414419,2101639,2012-08-26,3100945,Michael,"The location of Ravi's apartment couldn't be better.  Walking distance to so much of this great part of Boston. Shopping, sights, restaurants all nearby. Very convenient for getting into/out of Boston on the I90 too."
The apartment has a funky,eclectic,grad school sort of vibe which was perfect for me.,,,
Only challenges were parking and bathroom. Parking a few blocks away cost almost as much as the apartment and I got hit with a parking ticket on Beacon St. only 10 minutes over while unloading car.  I know this isn't the fault of the accommodation,but is definitely a reality of driving/parking in this part of  Boston.,,,,
As for the bathroom,it does require some attention.  Size and functionality are fine - just needs some updating and TLC.,,,,
Ravi was easy to deal with,met us when he said,and was easy to contact/communicate with.,,,
"I would definitely consider staying here again on my next trip to Boston. \"",,,,,
414419,2146331,2012-08-30,2842478,Jonathan,Everyone's said it: great location. Ravi was friendly and welcoming. The only problem I had was the lack of wifi.
414419,2153829,2012-08-31,3285398,Patrick,Great Location. Fit our needs perfectly. The apartment is comfortable and clean. Host was helpful and everything ran smoothly.
414419,2262216,2012-09-11,3082205,Ben,"Great location in Back Bay! Only a 5-10 minute walk to the Copley Station on the Green Line and a 10-15 minute walk down to Fenway. It's an old building, but that really didn't bother us. The lack of air conditioning wasn't a problem either since the temps were great while we were there. We left the windows open and the street noise wasn't really an issue. Ravi was a great host and was flexible with our check in and check out times. He also gave us some good recommendations and kept in touch while we were in town to make sure we were set. Would definitely recommend!"
414419,2311249,2012-09-17,379655,Josh,Ravi's place was great.  Awesome location in Back Bay coupled with a great host made our Boston trip wonderful.  I would definitely recommend Ravi's place to other travelers looking to be close to the Back Bay action.
414419,2436067,2012-09-28,3223448,Mita,"I really like my stay at Ravi's place. It pretty much looks like the photos; very artistic, gorgeously decorated with some nifty furniture & artwork, & very clean. The bed is loft-style so you do have to be able to climb the stairs. I am clumsy so managed to bump & bruise my ankle at the top step, but if you are more graceful, I'm sure you'll manage. The bed's very comfy; I had no problem getting my 8 hrs on the two nights I was there."
"I also love the location; Back Bay really is the \"\"frou frou\"\" neighborhood of Boston",so it feels very safe & there are a lot nice shops & cafes nearby on Newbury St. My visit to Boston was to catch the last two games at Fenway Park this season (Go Red Sox!) so if that's your purpose,I'd recommend this place. It's about a half hour's walk,or if you're feeling lazy or have bought an unlimited Charlie Ticket,then catch the green line at Copley station & get off 2 stops later at Kenmore & you're pretty much at the ballpark.,
As a host,Ravi was very easy to deal with & even left work early in the middle of the day to get the place ready in time for our arrival (we came from NY,so we arrived on train at Back Bay station),which was very much appreciated because it was a hot day & my duffle bag was heavy!,,
As other reviewers have said,the only other thing I gotta mention is that the bathroom is tiny & shares a sink with the kitchen,but it's clean,so I had no issue with it. I also  had a bit of difficulty when opening the apartment door,because the key & door are old,but we were never locked out or anything
Overall,"I would stay here again next time I'm lucky enough to catch another game at Fenway!\"",,,,
414419,2537459,2012-10-08,3041543,Matthew,"This was a beautiful apartment in a great part of town.  We took the train from NY to Boston Back Bay, and easily walked to the apartment in 10-15 minutes.  We were very close to the subway and major bus routes, and lots of great restaurants, shopping, and sights."
The bed was comfortable,the use of the kitchen was great,and being able to relax in this quiet place was just what we needed.,,,
Ravi was flexible in meeting with us,and moving in and out was a breeze.  If we go back to Boston,"we will try to stay here again!\"",,,
414419,2579898,2012-10-11,3362644,Andrew,"The place was awesome! Full of character, perfect for a solo traveler. Bathroom is small but not a big deal. Great location, close to Copley T, shopping, and food."
"Ravi was very accommodating and nice. Would definitely recommend this place!\"",,,,,
414419,2647260,2012-10-18,3070425,Beth,"Ravi's place is in a great location of Boston. The character of the area is amazing. Everything is easily accessible. The place looks just as it does in the photos. The heating automatically goes on so it was nice and warm throughout the night. The supplies in the kitchen are limited. We had to go out for tea/coffee as there's no kettle, however, with the abundance of cafes it wasn't a problem. The bathroom is very small and could do with some upgrading. Overall, a pleasant stay. Ravi was very helpful and gave us advice on where to go. He was also very good at correspondance and arranging check in and out times."
"\"",,,,,
414419,2678603,2012-10-22,886799,Alice,"Wow, what an amazing stay I had in Boston and half the credit must go to Ravi. He was nice enough to give me a mini tour of Back Bay the first night I got there and show me all the amenities in the loft. Really cool guy who happens to know a lot about Boston so use him to your advantage!"
Ravi's place is a decently sized and lit loft. You can truly find everything you need right in the living space. The bathroom is small but who really cares unless you're trying to fit a whole family in there all at once? There were mirrors placed in every corner which I absolutely loved. I found that in Boston the whole town stares at you when you walk by so I guess I made use of those mirrors as I felt a bit self-conscious (I'm from Toronto so everyone looks down when they walk). The decor definitely gives the place an authentic finish. Most of the furniture is made of wood which gives it a homely feel.,,,,,
I spent most of my time in Back Bay,the North End,Downtown Crossing and the Charles River Esplanade which is a street away from Beacon Street (there's a beautiful stroll by the water,some docks,and a sailing club). I must say,Back Bay is the absolute safest spot to stay and walk around. I was a female riding solo all weekend so that was extremely important to me. It was nice to return to a place that felt like a real home at night! Not to mention
All in all,phenomenal stay here in Back Bay and I look forward to my return!,,,,

414419,2707686,2012-10-24,3837392,Krista,"What a fantastic location for being right in the centre of Boston - it was perfect for what I needed just a one night layover in Boston before flying out.  Instead of staying out in an airport hotel or paying $$$$ for a Back Bay hotel I got to drop my things and explore Newbury Street, the Public Gardens and walk along the Charles River all steps from Ravi's place.  Ravi was a welcoming, friendly and helpful host and the space was tidy.  Bathroom was the only negative (sorry Ravi :)) - tiny and old, I didn't venture into the shower.  But overall, it worked for what I needed and I had a great experience with my first Air BnB!  Thanks Ravi!"
414419,2712651,2012-10-24,3855594,Claire,Ravi was responsive and helpful throughout the booking process and  met me at check in and was really friendly.
We stayed one night- the space was perfect for this amount of time. Comfy couch and space to chill out. Up and down the ladder to get to the bed was okay but I couldn't have done that for many more nights in a row. Bathroom is tiny but suited us for the time we were there. Again,would have needed more space for a longer stay.,,,,
Great part of Boston,"SO PRETTY! \"",,,,
414419,2714546,2012-10-25,688951,Vida And Tim,The apartment was exactly as described and in a great location.
Communication with Ravi was really good and check in/out was straightforward. We thought it was good value for the area and would stay again if we returned to Boston.,,,,,
Parking was a bit of a nightmare,but that's not Ravi's fault by any means,just something to be aware of if you're driving there;  we eventually found a multi-story car park for $30 for 24hrs about 15 minutes walk away.,,,
"We'd definitely recommend the apartment to others.\"",,,,,
414419,2798183,2012-11-04,3341235,Mirasol,Ravi was an excellent and very welcoming host. His studio is in great location. It is very cozy and very nicely decorated. Highly recommended!
414419,2894767,2012-11-16,3581197,Kate,"Ravi's place was great, he was very responsive when I was contacting him about details prior to out arrival and explained very clearly the best and cheapest way to get to his place. The loft is exactly how it appears in the photos and the location could not have been better! Recommend this place to anyone who has a few days in Boston it was great!!"
414419,3006083,2012-12-02,3248006,Maarten,"Ravi is a nice guy and the pictures on airbnb give a good impression of the place: a small studio with characteristic features. Back Bay is a nice and popular neighbourhood, and in walking distance of MIT (take bus 1 across the bridge when it snows). I recommend it to everyone!"

414419,3111018,2012-12-18,3625056,Lauren,"We absolutely LOVED Ravi's apartment! The eclectic style is great! Very cozy and you could not ask for a more perfect location. The Back Bay area was great and located close to everything. We could walk anywhere or there were several transit stops located very close by. Ravi was great!!! Super friendly, real top notch guy. This was our first time to Boston and he was really helpful in recommending places to go and things to see. Highly recommend the Boston Ballet Nutcracker if you are visiting during the holidays!"
"We were so sad to leave and cannot wait to go back! We will definitely be contacting Ravi for our next Boston trip ;)\"",,,,,
414419,3335272,2013-01-12,4609637,Pascale,Ravi est le premier hôte chez qui je vais grâce à airbnb. J'ai beaucoup apprécié l'appartement de Ravi ; l'emplacement plein centre-ville permet de découvrir aisément la ville à pied. Le métro est à proximité et la rue Newbury et Boylston sont à 2 minutes.
Le studio de Ravi est chaleureux et fonctionnel. Son petit côté bric-à-braque m'a charmé. La salle de bain un peu rudimentaire,mais sinon l'ensemble répond parfaitement aux besoins d'un voyageur!,,,,

I am a guy and that being said this place is more catered to a guy's personality and cleanliness. The owner was very nice and explained everything well. It was definetly a unique experience which was what i was looking for."
414419,3481225,2013-02-05,335581,Sandeep,"Amazing apartment. the wall hangings and books of Vangogh, Rembrandt along with the classic furniture adds a unique ambience to the flat. The location is awesome too. walkable distance from Esplanade, Newburry street. you can do all the shopping around there and some good restaurants around too. had a great time. If i have to complain about anything it will be the small bathroom but it didn't matter much."
"Ravi is as good as you expect any host to be. i left in a hurry and left my jeans he message me offering to courier it to my place. all in all i had a great time. \"",,,,,
414419,3496864,2013-02-08,4511115,Edurne,"The apartment is nice and the location is great, most of the important places in Boston are at walking distance and anyway the T (subway) is close. The place is big and comfortable, but the toilet + shower are too small. It was ok for a couple of days. Ravi was flexible with our arrival and departure times and overall our experience was good."
414419,3579891,2013-02-19,4068791,Pete,"First, I know this comment is about the apartment, but about transportation to it. I flew into BOS and you can get from there to Ravi's place absolutely free on public transit. I thought that was awesome!"
Ravi was great at being able to meet me at his place for check in. The apartment is pretty cool. The pictures show the place exactly like it is! The bathroom is small,but honestly people,how much room do you need? His place is near the convention center,"only a 10 minute walk away. This place was perfect for me and I'm glad Ravi was able to accept me while I visited Boston.\"",,
414419,3611590,2013-02-26,3675253,David,"Great location in the Back Bay, right next to the common and the hustle of Newbury and the area. Lovely little apartment in a lovely block."
Ravi was informative and let us be,"recommend!\"",,,,
414419,3683826,2013-03-04,4591759,Sarah,"We had a great time at Ravi's this weekend. He was so nice and very easy to communicate/coordinate with. The loft was perfect for our trip - awesome location, cool decor, comfy bed and furnishings. As Ravi and other guests have mentioned, the bathroom is tiny, but once you start exploring Boston, you'll realize that EVERYTHING is just a little more cramped around the city. Not a big deal for us, and probably a good representation of the lifestyle in Boston."
414419,3763091,2013-03-12,2872787,Janice,Ravi's place is great!
This was my first successful experience with airbnb and Ravi helped facilitate a great,memorable stay. I stayed for a Sunday night,and it was just going to be me and another friend,but another friend needed a place to stay and Ravi was so accommodating,helpful and knowledgeable about the area surrounding the neighborhood.,
The place was more spacious in person than in the pictures. The couch and chairs were also very comfortable and the loft bed was pretty comfortable,too. Though the bathroom seems small,there's privacy with a fold-out shutter screen. And I thought that there was a lot of room inside the shower. It's definitely got a home-y vibe,with the vintage/antique decorations,cable t.v. and internet,heater
There was also plenty to do and see around the neighborhood. Overall,it's a great place,"very cozy and I can't wait to get back to Boston to try to stay here again.\"",,,
414419,3778470,2013-03-13,5404804,Shana,"This was my first trip to Boston and using the airbnb services. I had complete anxiety about hostels and I feel very lucky to have had the  opportunity to have stayed at Ravi's place. It was important for me to be relaxed and have a place where I could get work done.Traveling can be quite exhausting and I must say that staying at Ravi's loft felt very warm, cozy and home like. He was a down to earth hospitable host. His loft was completely cozy and central to many  restaurants, breakfast nooks, book shops and boutiques. The loft was decorated nicely with a focus on art by Matisse and Picasso, the lush green couches were super comfy and the desk was conveniently centered by the window with access to great light. Not to mention, it smelled so good in his loft! As an artist I appreciated his beautiful clean well lit space. I felt very comfortable and the energy was calm. Also, I appreciated Ravi's box of recommend take out restaurants. There was nothing better then having some Chinese food while I got cozy in the chair and watched t.v. I highly recommend anyone to stay at Ravi's place when in Boston!!!"
414419,3783202,2013-03-14,1315201,Daniel,Ravi was extremely accesible and responsive with communications. The apartment was clean and ready for our use. The location is EXCELLENT. Ravi is a personable guy and made the stay very easy.
Also,the apartment is unique and well decorated. Ravi's got great taste!,,,,

414419,3861131,2013-03-22,1682375,Mark,"Perfect Airbnb experience - Ravi was communicative and friendly throughout the booking process and was a friendly, unfussy but attentive host. The apartment is the perfect base for a trip to Boston - really cosy, ideally located and tastefully decorated. Everything was perfect and we only wish we'd stayed for longer."
414419,3884956,2013-03-25,1550971,John,"Great Back Bay location a short walk to/from the T. Lovely little apartment perfect to use as a HQ while you are touring the lovely area. Ravi was nice, informative, and available."

He is only a few blocks away and I easily walked to Fenway Park, MIT, Boston Common, the Prudential Center, Newberry Street shopping, and the Freedom Trail. His apartment is close to everything and in a great neighborhood. I was there right after the marathon bombing and Ravi was considerate enough to called to make sure everything was \"\"OK'. Ravi is a top notch host. In summary"
414419,4360642,2013-04-30,2926253,Ron,"Ravi was a great gracious host! He met me when I arrived and helped me get established in the area. I love the Back Bay area. The place was cool with great funky decor. It is compact, like the pictures show, but is comfortable."
414419,4412052,2013-05-03,6104251,Wendy,This really is the best location in Boston! The apartment is just as cute as it looks online and Ravi was a great host. I would definitely stay at his place again.
414419,4425862,2013-05-04,6158783,Kim Aiya,"Great place - awesome neighborhood - accommodating host. Ravi was extremely helpful, flexible, and welcoming. I chose his place because I'm interested in moving to Back Bay. He brought me guides and some local papers and spent some time telling me about the neighborhood, how to get to favorite spots, and what it's like to live in the area - and then handed over the keys so I could experience it for myself. This is the perfect place to stay if you want to be in a safe, well-kept spot in a great neighborhood that's close to everything in Boston. And, as other reviewers have said, it's comfortable, cozy, and felt like home."
414419,4513888,2013-05-10,4550019,Karin,All was great!  EXCELLENT location - the best of Boston within walking distance.
414419,4537694,2013-05-11,288209,Sam,Ravi is an excellent host. We had a great time. And it could not be in a better location.
414419,4608804,2013-05-15,4609055,Rebecca,My husband and I stayed at Ravi's apartment for three nights. From the beginning Ravi was super easy to communicate with. He would respond to messages through airbnb or to his cell phone almost immediately. This was our first booking through airbnb so that was very comforting.
The apartment is well located - close to the shops and restaurants in the Back Bay area and was a ten minute walk to downtown (Boston Common and the start of the Freedom Trail).,,,,,
Ravi also had lots of tourist info to look through so we could plan our visit.,,,,,
We had a late arrival on a Saturday night and Ravi made himself available to meet us at the apartment with the key. Much appreciated!,,,,,
Yes the bathroom is small as described but the shower itself was great so we were happy.,,,,,
"Thanks Ravi :)\"",,,,,
414419,4634968,2013-05-17,4752924,Dinesh,Ravi was very accommodating and responsive. His place is in a fantastic location in Boston and made for a great short trip to the city.

414419,4786778,2013-05-26,2128996,David,"We loved this apartment! It's really nicely decorated, clean and in a perfect location. We could walk to almost anything we wanted to do. Ravi was a great host, too, always quick to answer emails."
414419,4959751,2013-06-04,4269127,Ruth,Ravi's place is great! Really enjoyed our stay.
Ravi was great at being in touch. Check in was no problem. He was very welcoming and easy going.,,,,,
Flat itself is great. It was comfortable and quirky.,,,,,
No air con (which we knew beforehand) but fans worked fine really. Bed up high so if you're scared of heights probably not one for you but it was really comfy - more so than many normal beds I've slept in. Plenty room and good fun.,,,,,
Bathroom is only downside but it's grand. Serves its purpose. I wouldn't be banking on doing loads of cooking in the kitchen either but you certainly could if you wanted to. There is plenty of crockery and a good big fridge for drinks etc.,,,,,
The room is fantastic. So much light and comfortable. The furnitature is cool.Note,no wifi but does have an internet cable. Cable tv is handy to keep up to date with the Red Sox.,,,,
Location is fantastic - love Back Bay. Esplanade near house great for a run. Lots of bars,restaurants close by. Near to trolley stop and easy to walk into town if you wanted to anyway. And to Fenway!,,,,
Thanks Ravi for a fun stay.,,,,,

414419,4994426,2013-06-06,4766514,Nicole,We had such a great time at Ravi's place! He met us right when we arrived and gave us an overview of the place and spent a lot of time making recommendations as to what we should do with our time in Boston. His communication was great from start to finish. The location was walkable to nearly every attraction! It was decorated to perfection and we really felt like we got a great Boston experience staying here. HIGHLY recommend.
414419,5028907,2013-06-08,4133681,Heather,My partner and I wanted a place to stay for one night in the city before moving on to see family. This was the PERFECT set-up for us. The location is prime and Ravi is an excellent host. We arrived SUPER late and he was so accommodating and let us check in late/early. He's very prompt with communication and the apartment is just as he described.
I wouldn't plan on doing much cooking in the kitchen and the bathroom is a tight squeeze,but it's perfect for the on-the-go traveler who wants to see the city,"not watch sit at home and watch TV!\"",,,
414419,5160762,2013-06-16,3738771,Saad,"Ravi was a great host. We were late getting in to his apartment because we got lost, driving around Boston, but he waited for us so he could meet us before we started our stay. He had great communication before and after the stay and was very sweet and accommodating. His apartment is in a great location too!"
414419,5190507,2013-06-17,4900652,Eva,We couldn't have been happier staying at Ravi's beautiful studio in the Back Bay. The place was clean and very welcoming. We had to change our check-in time a few times and Ravi was as easy-going and as helpful as could be. We would happily return and give Ravi four thumbs up for our perfect get-away weekend!!
"\"",,,,,
414419,5337259,2013-06-25,3851443,Kirsten,Great location in Boston. I walked everywhere! Ravi's place is best for dudes that don't need outlets or a mirror in the bath room. Low maintenance people will be fine. Keep in mind you will need healthy knees & ankles to climb into bed each night.
414419,5635617,2013-07-09,6078082,Dana,What a great location!!!  Highly recommend staying at Ravi's place if you are looking to stay in Boston for a couple days!!  Walking distance to the T and the esplanade ..  We walked pretty much everywhere we went.
414419,5710658,2013-07-13,674670,Levi,The space is located in a beautiful neighborhood close to all of the best that Boston offers. I found everything to be exactly as described and Ravi was proactive in his communication with me. Thank you!
414419,5757039,2013-07-15,2641300,Matthew,"The title is not an over-exaggeration - Ravi's place really is the best location in Boston! Ravi was very accommodating and flexible. He's a great host with a great place. We lived in Boston for 2 years before and Ravi's place provided us the perfect location to revisit some of our favorite old sites while also exploring new nooks in the Back Bay, Beacon Hill and the rest of Boston. Perfect for 2 travelers as the open space is roomy and bed is comfortable. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to explore Boston. It's just minutes from everything you would want or need!"
414419,5805994,2013-07-17,223576,Catherine,"Ravi's place is indeed perfectly located, and has all the basics one might need (not more!). It is tastefully decorated! However, don't expect to cook your meals there, and if you are a little picky on cleanliness, you should probably rent a more expensive apartment. Parking is a major issue, all the streets in the whole Back Bay neighborhood being reserved for residents. But a morning run on the Charles River bank is worth a few sacrifices! Ravi has been really nice and easy to get in touch with!"
414419,5902215,2013-07-22,4636270,Case,"Highly recommend Ravi's loft in Back Bay, Boston. Gives you a real feeling of living & being a local in Boston. Short walks to Copley Square, Newbury St, Charles River & Fenway Park. Great area Back Bay, always felt safe walking around all hours of the night. Ravi was awesome communicating & is very helpful with info on the city (what to do & restaurants)"
Bathroom is small but can easily shower in it. Kitchen isn't really for cooking but no need to cook with Newbury St so close.,,,,,
Would definitely stay there again & recommend it to anyone who wants a locals feel.,,,,,

414419,6057567,2013-07-28,3263111,Josh,"I loved this place! Ravi was totally cool and super easy to work with. The house is in a killer part of town, surrounded by parks and a few hundred feet from the bay. Its an old tiny place with some very neat decoration and layout. You can see the house's age so its definitely not frou-frou, but I stayed with my wife and 2 year old and we enjoyed it."

414419,7435507,2013-09-20,7892531,Victoria,What a great apartment - I stayed here with my fiancé for four glorious days in a wonderful city. The apartment is in a prime location - not only is Back Bay in the very thick of things but it's so beautiful with lovely brownstones and tree-lined streets. The apartment is small and a little rough round the edges but that's part of its charm and it has everything you'd need for a short stay. Ravi himself was enormously helpful and easy to deal with.  We can recommend him and his lovely apartment whole-heartedly!

Ravi was a really friendly guy and gave us great tips about the local area which were much appreciated.

414419,8943087,2013-11-27,6303383,Mary,"\"I am a woman in my 40s ,traveling for a business trip at the Hynes Convention Center. This place did not work out for me, due to the pungeant smell that triggered an allergic reaction (a combination of mothballs, deodorizers, and I'm not sure what else). I had to leave after a night, because it bothered me so much and I could not sleep. I also found the sex magnets on the fridge offensive. The place seemed like too much of a \"\"man cave\"\" for what I needed! \""
414419,9441037,2013-12-29,7639114,Kellie & Lachie,"Ravi's place was amazing. Easy to find, beautiful location, close to everything. Ravi greeted us at the apartment with a beer, helpful maps and some great advise as to what we should see. We could have asked for a better place to stay."
414419,9772556,2014-01-09,9908006,Yackar,"I stayed twice over Ravi's place during the holidays time, and everytime I had a great experience. Ravi was very accomodating regarding the time to meet and get the keys from him! He showed us how everything worked in the place, and even had some touristic booklets and guides to help us decide what to visit first in Boston."
I was charmed by the unique atmosphere of the apartment,"and it was greatly located too. I will definitely come back again!\"",,,,
414419,9835651,2014-01-13,1574793,Sam,"Ravi's place was everything I could have asked for -- clean, tidy, conveniently located. He also went above and beyond as a host to make sure my mom's stay was easy and comfortable. The apartment itself is beautifully decorated and located nearby to everywhere we wanted to go -- Fenway, the BSO, the Common, Newbury St., etc...-- plus it was only a couple blocks from the T. All in all a great stay! Thanks Ravi!"
414419,10106918,2014-01-31,11491141,José,"An outstanding flat and an excellent host. The flat is extremely well located and very comfortable (the warmth was certainly appreciated given the cold weather outside). It is very well decorated, and it can comfortably host four people. Ravi was very accommodating with check-in and check-out times, and also gave us great tips for places to visit in our short trip to Boston as well as a plethora of guides and pamphlets for local attractions. Overall, our accommodation experience in Boston could not have been better."
414419,10719288,2014-03-04,676383,Brittany,"I stayed at Ravi's place with my two co-workers for four nights. We were in town for a conference at the Hynes Convention Center, and the location of the apartment couldn't have been better. We were close to the conference, restaurants, coffee shops, bus stops, the T, bars, etc. Not to mention staying in beautiful Back Bay is a perk in itself. I will say it's a bit of a close fit for three people (which we expected based on the description of the place), but we didn't spend a ton of time in the apartment except to sleep, so it worked well."
Ravi himself is very responsive,friendly,helpful,and laid-back. We each had a set of keys so we could each come and go as we pleased without having to always coordinate amongst ourselves. When we first arrived,Ravi took the time to orient us in the neighborhood and point out the closest grocery store,drugstore
Overall,we had a great experience. Thanks,"Ravi!\"",,,
414419,10795668,2014-03-08,3267371,Lisa,We had a lovely stay at Ravi's place. He was very helpful and answered our questions during our stay promptly and well.
The small bathroom was fine,albeit we are quite small people. The location is really nice,easy to navigate from and a good part of town. We struggled a tiny bit with the bed beIng up the ladder,but it was worth it for the living space,"which is fabulous. We were always please to get back here after a hard day's sightseeing. Would definitely recommend.\"",
414419,10851602,2014-03-10,12287788,Catherine,"Ravi was really accommodating to our flexible/haphazard travel plans - friendly and obliging despite some last minute changes on our end. The space is lovely, clean, and in a great location. It made a perfect home base for three guests in town for work and tourism. Some of the best aspects of the space include large windows, high speed internet, and a quiet street and building most hours."
414419,11071069,2014-03-19,4722855,Tj,Good place and great location!  Perfect for a few day stay.  Things were clean and the bed had a good mattress.
414419,11163288,2014-03-23,8691919,Amanda,Very cool place—and the neighbourhood is incredible. Ravi was also a great communicator. Thanks!
414419,11319085,2014-03-30,11049153,Stacey,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay in Ravi's cozy apartment. We had a brief layover in Boston on our way back from an international trip, and we felt like we were simply crashing at a friend's place. We enjoyed drinking our coffee while looking out the big front windows."
A few days before we were to arrive,"a large fire occurred on Ravi's street that might have prevented us from staying at his apartment. Ravi immediately notified us of the situation and told us he had contacted AirBnB to make alternative plans if necessary. We really appreciated his initiative and communication.\"",,,,
414419,11532903,2014-04-07,4865462,Jason,"I recently stayed at Ravi's Back Bay! Best Location in Boston! listing during a weeklong conference in Boston. The location was great with easy access to the metro and all the restaurants/cafes around Newbury Street. Also it was a perfect location for early morning runs along the Charles River. The apartment is as it looks in the pictures--small but for one or two people perfect. Ravi was a very accommodating host with arrival and departure times. Given the location, cleanliness and ease of communicating and working with Ravi, I would definitely choose this apartment again for future trips to Boston."
414419,12435558,2014-05-02,13959165,Johnny,I had a great time at Ravi's place in the back bay. Great location near Newberry st
"\"",,,,,
414419,12577044,2014-05-05,13810163,Carla,"Non avremmo potuto desiderare di meglio! Sono appena stata a Boston con un'amica e ci siamo letteralmente innamorate dell'atmosfera bohémienne e accogliente della casa. Le foto rispondono pienamente alla realtà: l'appartamento è molto raccolto ma decisamente funzionale per due persone, nonché pulito e ordinato. Voto 10 alla posizione nel cuore del quartiere di Back Bay, rinomato per l’architettura delle sue case vittoriane, nonché per la posizione molto prossima al Charles River che regala magici scenari al tramonto e per la tranquillità (sebbene a pochi passi da ristoranti, negozi, locali, attrazioni turistiche)."
Ravi è stato un padrone di casa amabile e disponibile,anche considerando che abbiamo avuto un piccolo contrattempo con la consegna dei bagagli in aeroporto e che abbiamo dato il suo riferimento per eventuali comunicazioni da parte del customer service.,,,,
Insomma,"soluzione assolutamente da raccomandare!\"",,,,
414419,12828699,2014-05-12,13069613,Miranda,"Ravi was very nice, and super accomodating.  Very laid back, and nothing was at all complicated about getting the the apartment and picking up keys. We had a very early flight in, and Ravi graciously met us at a very early hour.  He had no rules or checklist, and it was an easy in, easy out. (we left the place as we found it ofcourse.)  The best part of the apartment was the location.  CENTRAL! All things walkable!  Perfect spot to be in for a visitor to the city."
414419,13005995,2014-05-17,2488223,JoAntonio,The place was located in a a great place and we were able to walk everywhere. The apartment was very clean and the design of the place was also awesome. The host was very understanding and adjusted to our arrival time which kept on changing. Overall great experience!
414419,13066040,2014-05-19,12231287,Joshua,Ravi was a pleasant and responsive host. Easy to communicate with. Check in and check out went very smoothly. The apartment is small but comfortable and kitchy and has everything you need. Would recommend.
414419,13216887,2014-05-22,6745365,Laura,"Loved Ravi's place. Great set up for a smaller space in Boston, and the Back Bay location is absolutely amazing! It's just a couple of blocks from the riverfront with running paths and parks, and just around the corner from shopping & bars on Newbury St. Everything is pretty walkable in Boston, but Ravi's apartment is incredibly convenient to anything you want to see or do in Boston. The only drawback is the super small bathroom/shower (sink is in the kitchen, no stove - only a small burner), but if you're in Boston for fun you're only there for a few minutes before you head back out on the town. I would definitely recommend it for short stays and fun weekends!"
414419,13288884,2014-05-24,5220817,Sara,We loved staying in the apartment! The location was perfect and the apartment was very clean. Ravi was a great host. He was very accommodating and met us late at night to hand off the keys after our flight was delayed. Overall a great experience and would absolutely recommend this apartment. Can't beat the price at this location!
414419,13314913,2014-05-25,14225204,Kerry,"Adorable place in a beautiful neighborhood!  Ravi was great, communicative and helpful.  Thank you!"

414419,13920091,2014-06-08,13874615,My,"Great neighborhood, felt safe. It's the right balance between quiet but still accessible to everything going on.  Loved that it was close to Charles River.   Ravi was nice- responded most of the time.  The place was indeed small.  The restroom was definitely TINY. Bathroom, which consisted of a stand shower and toilet, was about the size of airplane bathroom.  The sink serves as both the bathroom and kitchen sink.  Overall though, the place did its' job."
414419,14558300,2014-06-22,14717177,Tiffany,"Like many have said before this apartment is in a great location. The neighborhood was safe and well located. Our plane was late and Ravi had someone waiting to check us in which i greatly appreciated. The air conditioner situation was a little confusing, and there are a few minor upkeep issues I had with the apartment. Overall I would recommend to a friend. Thanks for opening up your home."
414419,14740213,2014-06-25,1113465,Wade,Ravi was a good host.  He provided a nice rundown of the neighborhood.  The location of his apartment was excellent.  The street was incredible with gorgeous homes and lots of sidewalks and easy access to public transportation (T stops).
414419,14968065,2014-06-30,6697624,Mark,"Ravi was easy to be in touch with and his place was--as advertised--in a super-convenient, very safe, very nice neighborhood. It worked very well for me. The main room is spacious and well appointed. The kitchen area, though small and lacking a stove, had everything I needed. The bath was a little more rustic than I'd have preferred. But overall, the experience was positive."
414419,15199596,2014-07-04,11180938,Carmen,We stayed in Ravi's apartment in July for two nights.
The apartment was ok and well located in Boston,but the bathroom was really small and old and there wasn't sink!!!,,,,
When we arrived in we had to wait for Ravi around two hours to make the check in,"and when we arrived at the apartment the airbed wasn't inflated.\"",,,,
414419,15623344,2014-07-13,14407629,Marije,We stayed in Ravi's apartment for a week during a conference that was held in the Hynes Convention Center. The apartment was very conveniently located for this. The neighborhood is very nice and safe and has easy access to public transport. Ravi made us feel very welcome and was very responsive to any inquiries we had before arriving and during our stay. The apartment fit our party of three nicely.
414419,15916727,2014-07-18,8259843,Xavier,Fantastic location! Ravi was super nice and helpful.
414419,16316191,2014-07-25,4887374,Lisa,"Nice place for a night or two in Boston. It is in a terrific location. The bathroom is tiny, but serviceable. The decor is very manly, but comfortable."
Ravi answers calls quickly and works to make you comfortable.,,,,,
"Enjoy!\"",,,,,
414419,16560796,2014-07-29,10998181,Laurie,"Ravi was awesome, super communicative and accommodating (early check in, late afternoon check out).  He gave us lots of ideas on where to go, what to do, and recommended an amazing coffee place.  The location was central to everything - we did a morning skate up/down the river in the mornings, and almost everywhere we wanted to go was within a two mile walk (and we went in every direction).  The bathroom is pretty rough, for sure, and for our mid-July visit, we were sweltering - didn't occur to me to check for a/c - my fault.  But the apt. was comfortable, places to lounge, a place to work.  I did realize that, at 45, I think I'm too old to climb a ladder to get to bed ;)"
414419,16750639,2014-08-01,3701153,Joe,Really liked the place. It was amazing to work during the day from the desk because of the great views out onto Beacon.
414419,17042494,2014-08-06,2034912,Anne,"Ravi was a great man and his apartment was located at the best location in Boston. We went to Fenway Park to see Red Sox game and we could just walked back to Ravi's apartment. Copley station was the nearest T station and just a few minutes away. We had a great time here. Thanks, Ravi. We loved Boston."

414419,17282273,2014-08-10,3736831,Hamilton,"Ravi was very communicative and very helpful - he tipped me off about The Thinking Cup, a very good cafe, and the ways streets are ordered in Back Bay  (don't know how long it would take me to figure out that the cross streets were in alphabetical order from east to west). Rani's flat is very well located. The bathroom is certainly small but the shower runs perfectly."
414419,17447819,2014-08-12,16891333,Sirinrat,"Ravi was a great host! We had a warm welcome from him standing by the street waiting to greet us. He helped us carey our 6 luggages from Thailand and explained how the neighborhood works. Ravi is amazing. The apartment is in great location for travelling around and was confortable. Ravi was also very responsive when we had questions regarding the basics in the apartment, he texted a reply real fast!"
414419,17659665,2014-08-15,19329395,Marcus,Really great experience. Ravi was very accommodating (we got delayed into boston and he waited for us to check in late) and gave us great tips for local bars and cafes. Really central location and comfy place. Thanks again.
414419,17704393,2014-08-16,18837143,Mario,Good communication. Apartment as described.  Great location.
414419,18019601,2014-08-20,9516785,Julián,Es un sitio perfecto para una pareja o un grupo de amigos. Está muy bien ubicado y es un sitio tranquilo para descansar.
414419,18168737,2014-08-23,15290239,Natalie,Ravi met us at the apartment and showed us how things worked. He had maps and information as well and told us about the area and where to find groceries and transport.he supplied us with bottled water.
414419,18325349,2014-08-25,17420289,Roger,"Although I didn't get the chance to meet Ravi as he was away, his communication through my arrival in Bosotn was superb. His friend Suzie was there when we finally checked-in. She was very friendly and offered tips on where to go to see the city. She even brought a pillow that was missing in the evening. The place was fairly clean and the area as mentioned was great. The bathroom was much smaller than we anticipated, but we were able to make due. There were no hiccups whatsoever during our stay  and overall, it was a very good experience."
414419,18522575,2014-08-28,15139918,Lucy,"Had a fantastic stay at Ravi's apartment - location is fantastic, just a few minutes from Newbury with loads of shops and restaurants. Ravi made lots of suggestions of places to eat and drink nearby which was really helpful. We had a good meal at Joe's and went for coffee at the Thinking Cup. The apartment was really cool with loads of interesting things on the walls. It was also clean and comfy."
414419,18570048,2014-08-28,542641,Taylor,Ravi was a fantastic host. Super communicative and helpful. The apartment is located in a beautiful neighborhood in Boston that is central to getting around and seeing the city. The apartment was perfect for two. Nice quiet space to work and think.
414419,18808469,2014-09-01,18617752,Alexandra,Ravi was a great host and provided so many amenities and recommendations of what to do in Boston. Modest bathroom and kitchen meet basic needs and aren't a problem at all! Awesome studio space for if you plan on spending a lot of time out of the room!
414419,19155430,2014-09-07,7916684,T.,"The apartment was conveniently located and within walking distance to shops, restaurants, the river, Boston Common and many more.  The front room was bright and cheery.  The bathroom was tight but we were aware of it and did not mind.  The place worked well for the four of us as we were out and about all day and only used the place for sleeping (daughter and friend slept on air mattress downstairs).  Finding parking near the apartment was not easy so we paid to park in the garage about a mile away.  Ravi was responsive and on-time as we came by to pick up the keys.  Overall, we had a pleasant experience staying at his place and would do it again!"
414419,19251093,2014-09-08,17671145,Heather,Ravi made us feel very welcome and trusted. Perfect host.
414419,19329293,2014-09-10,19987164,Corrado,"\"Ravi was great. We were a bit delayed with our flights. He completely understood and was still there to greet us. Gave us a brief description of where things are around the city in proximity to the loft. There were maps available to us in the loft. There is no parking around the area, so of you're driving the closest is the Commons. The area was amazing! The houses are gorgeous! And the ORIGINAL \"\"Cheers\"\" is about 5 blocks away."
"Besides that it lived up to my expectation. Thanks Ravi!!\"",,,,,

The location was amazing, in the middle of Back Bay (best neighborhood in town) and close to everything.  The place itself is wonderful and very clean, my wife and I loved it (we could definetly live there).  Overall, we felt so good with the place and the host, and loved the location.  We would stay there again anytime."
414419,19703326,2014-09-16,18877060,Lizzie,"Ravi is a great host. Flexible, a good communicator, and knows the area. The apartment is homey, comfortable and in a great area. One thing to note is that there's 1 bed, not two, though the bed does sleep two people comfortably."
414419,19823565,2014-09-19,14529772,Jost,"Ravi's place is located in a quite nice and safe neighborhood. If one likes to walk (as I do), a lot of places can be reached on foot (e.g. Fenway Park or Boston Public Garden can be reached within 10-20 min). The appartment is equipmed very cosy. It is small but includes everything needed. The bed is located on top of the kitchen corner so one has to climb up a leader to reach it. Ravi was a great host and very quick in responding all my questions. Altough I arrived quite late in the evening, he took some time to show me his place carefully and to give me some inputs about Boston. The only thing I did not like so much was the fact that the appartment was not very clean."
414419,19957311,2014-09-21,15179927,Gwendolyn,"Ravi was a great host! He met me on time to walk through the apartment and gave recommendations on where to go. He had another guest checking in before it was time for me to leave for my flight, so offered to hold my bags. Very hospitable! The kitchen is small, but I recommend dining out anyhow. The unit was clean, cozy and the area was quiet. Perfect for three days!"
414419,20145413,2014-09-24,9797583,Bree,"Ravi is a lovely, friendly and helpful host. His apartment is small but comfortable in a beautiful area close to great restaurants and shopping and must dos in Boston. Thanks Ravi for a great experience."
414419,20231354,2014-09-26,5785177,Dan,"Ravi was a great host and we enjoyed our stay at this cool loft apartment!  It is not new and the road noise might bother some folks.  But, the place was comfortable and had all that we needed for our short stay.  Ravi had recommendations for everything from transportation to food to museums, and gave us a rundown on getting around the neighborhood - all very helpful for those of us not accustomed to big cities.  When his schedule changed, he even contacted us ahead of check in to let us know the room was available at our originally requested time.  We were able to easily walk to Fenway, MIT/Harvard, and the North End."
414419,20345419,2014-09-28,19807687,Charles,"Everything was as promised in Ravi's place. I found the unit to be in a very well maintained state. The extra touches like the bottled water in the fridge, newspaper and fresh clean towels made the stay over the top. Ravi was not available to greet me, but that didn't matter as he has a great support staff in place to make you feel right at home."
"The place itself is centrally located and makes for an easy shot to wherever you want to go while in Boston. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!\"",,,,,
414419,20573621,2014-10-01,20957010,Jeff,Ravi was super responsive when we were setting up the time to meet and also very helpful on where and when to park (which can be tricky and expensive in Boston). The apartment location is amazing and really neat to have a second story view over Beacon St. The studio itself is neat and eclectic. The bed is up in a loft above the kitchen so you will need to climb up. Or there was a mattress we could use as well. I would recommend this place to others if you are by yourself or a young couple and want a great base to explore Boston.
414419,20610918,2014-10-02,9250030,Stephanie,Ravi was a great host -- was very flexible with my arrival time (I changed it almost three times) and super nice. He even accidentally left with the room keys and quickly ran back to give them to me. The listing looks just like the photos and is in a great location. The proximity to the airport (a 10 minute drive) and to restaurants/shopping on Newbury is worth the price.

414419,20703327,2014-10-04,15019602,Kristine,It was a great location and met our needs for the couple of nights we were there. Ravi was very helpful in giving us information about the area with things to do and places to go.

414419,21426566,2014-10-17,11428479,Kelly,"Ravi greated me and my coworker with a wonderful upbeat personality.  His apartment is just as it appears in the photos, clean and welcoming. The hallways could use some cosmetic attention, the owner of the building really needs to consider this.  The bathroom is small but functional. Can't beat the location!!"
414419,21793800,2014-10-24,21399809,Chebli,"Très joli studio, dans immeuble ancien et typique, ce qui explique les équipements parfois vétustes de l'appartement (surtout électriques). Logement idéal que je recommande très fortement pour 2 personnes, 4 si pas difficiles sur la qualité du couchage (matelas à air pas confortable). Emplacement idéal pour visiter Boston. Hôte charmant et courtois. A savoir cependant que l'appartement, n'étant sans doute pas occupé hors location, ne dispose d'aucun des accessoires de courtoisie habituels, ni pour la salle de bain (shampoing, savon...), ni pour la cuisine (sel, poivre, sucre, café...)."

His suggestions on things to do was really helpful and I really enjoyed his breakfast recommendation (Trident Bookstore/Cafe).  Definitely became my #1 place to stay next time I visit Boston.

His place is funky and cool and all the descriptions and reviews met our expectations. Don't plan on cooking in this place however. His listing stated \"\"sleeps 4\"\" and we knew that the second bed was an airbed"

414419,22805163,2014-11-15,22503537,Molly,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it could not have been better.  Ravi was incredibly helpful, the apartment was in an amazing location and this really made our trip to Boston. The apartment was a bit cold, however with winter in Boston this was to be expected. I would heartily recommend both his apartment and him!"
414419,22978834,2014-11-19,1929931,Lavinia,"Ravi's place is cute and cozy, and in a great location to visit the city, really close to the train station and the subway as well to the main an beautiful shopping streets in Back Bay (which is a really great neighborhood)."
As mentioned by another guest,the air mattress tends to deflate so maybe is good for just one person to sleep on it. The bathroom is really small,just the shower and the toilet,but it is clean,and the shower has good pressure. The sink is in the kitchen. We met Ravi at our arrival and he was really nice,he explained us about the main areas of the city and gave us some advices
414419,23108198,2014-11-23,18593334,Alex,Enjoy your stay in downtown Boston. Apartment very well placed near Charles River and the dowtown . Apartment small but very friendly (for 4 people).
Despite a small problem with heating,Ravi was very understanding and accommodating with us.,,,,
"Thank you for your apartment and your availability .\"",,,,,
414419,23270995,2014-11-27,7606741,Audrey,Ravi's place was awesome and it looked exactly as listed. The location was very convenient.  Ravi was flexible and accomodating. We had a wonderful stay at his apt.

414419,23562483,2014-12-04,19516874,Antoine,It's been a good journey in Ravi's place. The flat was enough furnished to spend some days in Boston in good conditions.
414419,23616074,2014-12-06,13923326,Casey,Ravi was a great host and is a cool guy. Check in and check out was easy and he was very thorough in making sure i had everything I needed
414419,24015458,2014-12-16,6863429,Trisa,"Ravi and his place lived up to all the other rave reviews! The apartment looks exactly like it does in the pictures - very homey and you have everything you need. The bathroom is a bit small and doesnt' have its own sink but that's just part of the full Boston-living experience, right? Ravi met us at the place and give us a quick low-down before he left us to it. We really appreciated his hospitality and thoughtfulness. He was also really easily reachable throughout our short stay. Everything about our stay was a easy and hassle-free! Would definitely recommend this place!"
414419,24206285,2014-12-22,19506689,Caroline,We spent 4 nights at Ravi's place and enjoyed our time a lot! Boston is a great city to explore!
Ravi' s appartment is very beautiful and decorated with so many details; it has everything it needs to make you feel at home! The neighbourhood is beatiful,very safe and extremely well located. Almost everything is walking distance!,,,,
Ravi as a person is very open and easy going. He is extremely helpful and caring. He makes sure you have everything you need when you arrive and is always available for tips or whatever you might need.,,,,,

414419,24500097,2014-12-29,8137797,Anthony,"L'appartement de Ravi était au-delà de nos attentes ! Bien que nous y ayons passé qu'une seule nuit, il est très confortable et parfait pour un couple qui voudrait y passer une semaine."
Ravi est un hôte vraiment agréable,très sympathique et qui a fait son maximum pour que nous nous sentions chez nous.,,,,
L'appartement est très bien situé,au coeur du quartier de Back Bay,à seulement 3-4 minutes de Newbury Street et  5-7 minutes à pied du fameux quartier de Beacon Hill.,,,
Nous recommandons l'appartement de Ravi à 100%,et nous y retournerons avec plaisir si nous avons de nouveau l'occasion de nous rendre à Boston.,,,,
Ravi's flat was beyond our expectations ! Even if we had only 1 night,it is very comfy and perfect for a couple who would like to stay for a week.,,,,
Ravi is a very friendly host,who did his best to make us feel at home. He gave us many tips about his city and all informations we needed to enjoy our stay.,,,,
The flat is in the best area,only 3-4 minutes from the Newbury Street by walk,and around 5-7 minutes from the famous Beacon Hill by walk.,,,
We definitely 100% recommend his flat,and if we make another trip to Boston,"we will stay again at his apartment with pleasure ! \"",,,
414419,24747108,2015-01-02,14773290,Jim,Ravi was very nice !
The appartement is really nice and very well located !,,,,,
the only problem is that there is only one real bed and the second ''bed'' is an Inflatable Mattress and it leaks...,,,,,
If it is not a problem then everything is great ...,,,,,
"Thank you Ravi \"",,,,,
414419,24892463,2015-01-03,7986510,Emily,"Ravi and his place were great! Although we had to check out earlier than expected, my aunt and I enjoyed our stay at Ravi's studio and his flexibility with our arrival and departure times. He allowed us to store our bags in his car until we had to go to the airport for our flight.  The apartment is really nicely decorated and situated in a great part of time. We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood for the short amount of time we were there with Ravi's suggestions in mind. The one thing I will say about the apartment (and we already told Ravi) was we had a tricky time trying to figure out how to turn on / off the lights in bathroom but we ended up using it as a night light."
414419,24999050,2015-01-04,23333846,Julia,My friends and I had a lovely stay at Ravi's place. He gave us a quick tour upon check-in and made sure we were all set before heading out. His apartment was cozy and clean. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable stay in a great location.
414419,25055121,2015-01-05,402406,Michael,"Ravi was a great host - very friendly, easy to communicate with and took the time to inform me of helpful spots in the neighborhood.  The apartment was great with a comfortable sofa, looked exactly as shown."
414419,25222286,2015-01-09,25645108,M,"Excellent spot, already want to come back."
414419,25325436,2015-01-12,25112254,Ash,"Our stay at Ravi's was special. The apartment looks exactly like the photos and makes you feel at home. Yes, the bathroom is small but it's part of the charm. Ravi was around to meet us, even with our flights being several hours late and gave a quick run down of the city (he has maps on the wall and lists of suggested places!) And then we really didn't hear from him again until we were arranging check out, yet I knew if we needed anything he'd be quick to respond."
The apartment is in an excellent location,we really walked to nearly everything. We walked the freedom trail,and all the way to the north end more than once. It's minutes from coffee shops and good food,"as well as plenty of shopping. The neighborhood is beautiful. I've definitely fallen in love with Boston.\"",,
414419,25467741,2015-01-17,1829720,Jarrod,"The location of Ravi's apartment could not be better, Back Bay is a beautiful area which is close to everything. The area felt very safe. The heating worked very well, too well in fact. Due to the bed being above the kitchen and having warm air rise it was very hard to cool the apartment for sleeping. I ended up sleeping on the couch with the window open. The kitchen was functional albeit without a microwave, sink plug and dishwashing liquid which obviously made using the kitchen more challenging. The wooden floor gave me a splinter (through a sock) that took tweezers and 10 minutes to get rid of. The tv has basic cable, 25 channels without sport or documentaries (premium cable advertised). Wi-Fi worked well without any issues. The bed was comfortable enough, being 6 foot 3 I struggled with my feet hitting the support structure at the end of the bed. Ravi's communication was very good, he was quick to answer emails and meet us on time as arranged for check in. The apartment images are very honest, it's just the little things that could be fixed which I believe would offer a more comfortable and enjoyable stay."
414419,25745413,2015-01-25,24611950,John,"Great experience with Ravi, both times we stayed there. Would stay again."
414419,25798192,2015-01-26,402406,Michael,"Ravi was a very nice host, easy-going, friendly and easy to communicate with.  The apartment is in a beautiful historic neighborhood, easy walk to everything you need."
414419,25863315,2015-01-27,21813804,Robert,"Great neighborhood. Great Location. Apartment is as billed. Very warm. Unfortunately, because of a major snowstorm, I was unable to stay overnight, and so cannot comment on the comfort of the bed."
414419,25880780,2015-01-28,24611950,John,"Really cool apartment in Back Bay. Clean, warm, comfortable, cool decorations. Ravi checked us in and was pretty hands-off after that, but always available. Great experience."
414419,26063227,2015-02-02,17664780,Adam,Nice apartment in the heart of Boston
414419,26282558,2015-02-08,27087713,Gary,"Great Location / Neighborhood, Warm and inviting atmosphere. Amenities were available for all our needs."
414419,26456766,2015-02-13,26473588,Karthik,I had a lovely stay at Ravi's place.
He gave me a quick tour upon check-in and made sure I was all set before heading out. The apartment  has a very eclectic feel,which I thoroughly enjoyed.,,,,
Its in a great location,beautiful area close to everything.,,,,
Ravi's communication was very good,quick to answer questions.,,,,
Wifi works well,"and TV had basic channels. Kitchen could do with a Coffee maker:)\"",,,,
414419,26664339,2015-02-16,27018068,Parthiban,"Ravi was accommodating and responsive from the beginning. Our arrival time was a little uncertain due to some weather-related issues, but Ravi made it easy to come get the keys to the place and check in.  Overall we had a great experience."
"\"",,,,,
414419,27161939,2015-02-27,11216748,Reynolds,"Excellent location, great host, decent apartment! The apartment is within walking distance of tons of restaurants, bars, and shopping. I also walked across the Mass Ave. bridge to Cambridge and it was a wonderful walk, even in the bitter cold. Ravi was super flexible and accommodating with check-in and check-out times, a great host! The apartment was comfortable and just as nice as pictured, despite a few minor issues such as a closet-sized bathroom with no sink (although kitchen sink was fine for brushing teeth, etc.), air mattress that deflated slowly overnight, and the door handle that easily fell off on the front door. None of these got in the way of a great stay and an otherwise cozy and pleasant place with awesome huge windows and great light."
414419,27228581,2015-02-28,24655167,Karan,"My experience was pretty good. Ravi made it a point to explain everything to us, didn't keep us waiting and we had a decent stay. I would stay there again."
414419,27325398,2015-03-02,39126,Clive,"Ravi was an excellent host. He was very friendly and welcoming, and gave us some tips about the neighborhood, which was fun to explore on foot. We walked and ate our way through Boston and had a blast even in the snow. Ravi's place was warm and cozy when it got a little cold and windy outside. I would recommend Ravi's place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Boston."
414419,27420670,2015-03-03,11494959,Jennifer,Ravi's place was great. As described. He was flexible to meet me late. Would stay again!
414419,27533360,2015-03-07,21277662,David,Had a great stay at Ravi's apartment. Ravi waited in for us when our plan from the UK was delayed and gave us some good tips for the local area. The apartment also has useful tips and maps on the wall. We loved the artwork and interesting books and found the bed on the mezzanine level comfy. A short walk to central Boston and also right in the middle of the action in Back Bay. Perfect for our short break!
414419,27805942,2015-03-12,12716475,Dennis,Great place; great location. Very clean. The apartment is true to its description.
414419,27872966,2015-03-14,1295315,Yoonah,"Ravi made me feel really welcome. Everything was really clean, and lots of beautiful posters everywhere. Had a wonderful time! Would come back again."
414419,28125103,2015-03-18,26949240,Jessica,"5 stars, Excellent location, easy walking distance to main attractions, everything that we needed and was expected from the ad. Ravi was very nice when I met him, gave some advice and then left us to it."
414419,28189605,2015-03-19,29188553,Pat,"Ravi's place was great! It was exactly as listed. He was helpful when my arrival was delayed by 4 hours and we were able to make arrangements to pic/up the key.  Although, i didn't have much time to explore the city, it seemed to be in a great location. I would recommend any one to stay there if they get the chance."
414419,28467732,2015-03-24,7862357,Shelly,Ravi was very nice and helpful.  He met us at the apartment to give us the keys and show us around the apartment. Everything was clean and exactly as the pictures show.  The bathroom is small but manageable.  The location is perfect for getting around the city and seeing the sights.  We had a wonderful stay.
414419,28585181,2015-03-26,17848380,YiQun,"Good host, communicative and friendly"
414419,28696611,2015-03-29,13567981,Guille,"El departamento de Ravi es tal como se muestra en las fotos. Muy lindo y muy acogedor. Tiene internet y TV, buena calefaccion y utensillos para poder cocinar a gusto. Por cierto esta muy bien decorado. La zona donde se encuentra ubicado es espectacular ya que tiene a pocas cuadras la calle Newbery con muchos comercios de todo tipo e incluso el subte para poder ir a cualquier punto de Boston. 100% recomendable."
414419,28989583,2015-04-02,22090854,Birgitta,"Vi tyckte att beskrivningen av lägenheten stämde,utom ett väldigt litet badrum utan handfat! läget var perfekt lugnt och tyst men ändå väldigt centralt! vilket vi tycker är viktigt! MEN det borde städas bättre!och dåligt med kaffe muggar och gafflar! Ravi som värd verkar lugn och trevlig!"
414419,29036761,2015-04-03,12578169,Eleanor,I highly recommend this apartment.  Ravi was a great host and the apartment was exactly as it was pictured.  It's in a fantastic location.
414419,29286633,2015-04-06,21524155,Dia,"I stayed here with Mum for three nights. We didn't meet Ravi but he was responsive and has flexible check in and check out which is very useful and much appreciated. The sitting room is nicely decorated, and the flat is clean. The kitchen/toilet is very tiny, and share a sink (see his notes) and it's very very basic, such as hot plates and no kettle. The stairs to the bed is very steep so if you get up at night to use the facilities, it might be an issue! Had photos of toilet and kitchen been included we probably wouldn't have gone with the flat. Also the door to the flat is dodgy (handle comes off) so be careful when shutting and opening. Same with window blinds. The WIFI info is underneath the rooter, which would've been useful to have on a piece of paper with other information when we arrived, such as light switches (oddly located). That said, it is in a very nice area and not far from most places and if you're not fussed about such things and just want somewhere to rest your head then I'd recommend."
414419,29599584,2015-04-10,21783151,Justin,"Ravi was a good host. He welcomed us and showed us around his place. He has maps of the area with recommendations and favorite places to eat and visit. He also gave us the Wi-Fi info and said we could contact him with any needs or concerns (we didn’t have any). He’s flexible with check-in and check-out, which is really convenient."
The apartment is a small studio in the Back Bay neighborhood. The bathroom is really small but my wife and I spent most of our time visiting Boston so we really only slept there. The street noise isn’t bad considering it’s a major city. That being said,the apartment complex has squeaky hardwood floors and we could hear our neighbors walking around upstairs from time to time.,,,,
The neighborhood is really nice,well-lit and close to shops,restaurants and bars. We felt safe the whole time we were there. There’s a CVS a few blocks from the apartment as well as a Trader Joe’s that’s about four or five blocks away. Ravi’s apartment is also not far from the T,so the location is pretty ideal.,,

414419,29970314,2015-04-15,27377358,Anthony,"We all enjoyed Ravi's apartment in Back Bay, it was an amazing stay lacking nothing in an area that made everything in town feel easily accessible. Ravi was super friendly and left us helpful tips to make the most of our stay in Boston. Would definitely stay here again when I come back, which I intend to."
414419,30087197,2015-04-17,20780154,Steve,"Ravi was easy to reach and responsive. The apartment is in a great location, was very clean and quiet. I was super happy with the choice and would definitely stay there again."
414419,30188816,2015-04-19,26437069,Kari,"Ravi's place was excellent! It is exactly what you see in the pictures, nothing fancy. There is only one sink in the kitchen and the bathroom is tiny. However, we weren't in Boston to stay in the apartment. The location is awesome! We were able to run along the Charles River in the morning since it was only one block away. Since we were there for the marathon, the finish line and expo were only blocks away on Boylston Street. His recommendations for places to eat were great as well. We went to his recommended coffee shop, The Thinking Cup, both mornings. He was a great host as well and called us at 1am when we arrived to make sure everything was ok. Very easy to be in contact with. We'll definitely plan on staying at Ravi's place if we're ever in the city again!"
414419,30439194,2015-04-22,14114137,Edward,"Ravi was great - flexible about meeting us there, very welcoming and knowlegable, and laid back"
The flat is small - especially the bathroom - but the description is accurate and upfront about that. The main living space is great. The lofted bed is comfortable but might be difficult for those with mobility issues.,,,,,
The location is awesome though - near to the Prudential and Convention Centers,as well as the Green Line T. So the whole city is 'on the doorstep'.,,,,
"So great value all in all - thanks Ravi.\"",,,,,
414419,30634874,2015-04-25,30900104,Rachel,"Beautiful apartment, clean, and in an incredible location.  Ravi was incredibly accommodating and made our trip to Boston significantly better.  I will definitely be staying here again when I am back in town!"
414419,30939249,2015-04-29,22347402,Jessica,Ravi was an excellent host. He was friendly and provided excellent directions and dining recommendations. The apartment was stylish and exactly as described in the photos- no surprises. 1 bed and one aero-bed.
414419,31025696,2015-04-30,31528006,Alex,"Thanks for a great stay in your beautiful apartment Ravi, and thanks for sticking around despite us being later than expected - a great host! The apartment was great, fantastic location and a great place to stay in Boston. I would recommend to anyone!"
414419,31098305,2015-05-02,27362534,Benjamin,Logement très confortable ! Emplacement idéal pour visiter Boston et vraiment proche du centre commercial Prudential Center. C'est un appartement ancien mais parfait pour faire de petit voyage à Boston. Proche du métro (5-10 minutes à pied). Le matelas à air n'est cependant pas très confortable (il se dégonfle un peu durant la nuit) mais l'autre lit est parfait.
"Pour résumer un très bon appartement sur Boston !\"",,,,,
414419,31426662,2015-05-05,25586426,Todd,"We had a good time staying at Ravi’s place.  The location cannot be beaten – central to everything.   Decorated with cool and eclectic art – kind of like living on the set of Friends.  Furnishing and finishing was well loved, and added to the comfort of the apartment, felt like coming home.  Slept great in the loft bed.  We would stay here again the next time we are in Boston.  Ravi was very accommodating with check-in and check-out times."
414419,31620990,2015-05-07,32175797,Sukhiya,"The house is centrally located and has a very good character, Ravi has good collections of books and artifacts, which make the house very intresting... There are few snags like the door systems and toilet is very cramped..."
It is a studio apartment having a mezzanine with a bed,privacy is thus compromised. and the air bed was not really comfortable  for my friends using it.,,,,
If you are driving pls make sure that you get a private garage as the limited parking in streets do cause inconvenience.,,,,,
We had great time as the house is centrally located.,,,,,

414419,32110510,2015-05-14,4605089,Nora,Ravi nos espero para darnos las llaves y explicarnos el funcionamiento del departamento. El vecindario es excelente para pasar unas vacaciones como si fueramos Bostonianos.
414419,32203731,2015-05-15,3266721,Centura,Very nice location.
414419,32311645,2015-05-17,522096,Rebecca,Totally enjoyed our stay. Perfect location for our needs. Well kept. Interesting decor.
414419,32745446,2015-05-21,28369490,Bradford,"Ravi made me feel very welcome, he was easy to get in touch with and available to answer any questions that I had. The location is absolutely perfect, easy walking distance to the green line, Fenway Ballpark, and the Boston Commons. Can't recommend it enough."
414419,32819402,2015-05-22,4642610,Chelsea,"Ravi was a great host--good communication beforehand, was flexible on when to meet us for check-in, greeted us upon arrival and gave great recommendations and directions to get around. The place is so quirky and charming. The pictures and description are accurate--it was smaller than I imagined (especially the bathroom), but that was part of the fun of it. It was fun to get a taste of what life is like for locals in Boston that staying in a fancy hotel just wouldn't provide. The place has such character and is decorated so uniquely. Ravi has done a good job providing maps, directions, and amenities for your stay. One thing I thought was interesting was the collection of shampoos and conditioners available in the shower! He gives you lots of options! The location is awesome. We took the Amtrack in and were able to get around everywhere by foot--walked to Boston Commons, Fenway, Copley Square. Perfectly located! My only regret is not getting to stay longer. Definitely recommend staying here!"
414419,33493770,2015-05-29,254656,Megan,"I had a great stay at Ravi's apartment! It's such a lovely location and the apartment itself is super cozy and comfortable. I was in town for a conference and I mostly just used Uber to get to the convention center (cost btwn $8-$12 generally) cause I was rushing - but there are a ton of great places to walk to if you're in town as a tourist. I loved the loft bed and slept super well up there - felt like I was in a cozy little treehouse. The wifi was fast and stable, something that's really important for me!"

My commute to Cambridge was easy with the T being only a ten minute walk away. Ravi had great communication and answered any questions quickly. The bathroom was very tiny, but it was functional. The only thing we missed was having access to a microwave, but the hot plate and toaster oven worked out great. I would say the place is best suited for a short stay, but my girlfriend and I really enjoyed our week there in Boston."

414419,37137193,2015-07-05,28820412,Jim,"\"Location, location, location is what this apartment has going for it. Unfortunately, for us, it was not enough.  The apartment is a quirky bachelor pad and probably would be fine for young, adventurous singles or couples, but for us 60-somethings, it was not a fit.  The building is old and the foyer smells musty.  The unit itself was clean, but shopworn, and there was an overwhelming odor of lemon-scented air freshener.  It is a studio, with a sleeping loft built above the kitchen area. The bathroom is a closet crammed with a toilet and shower. All washing has to be done in the kitchen sink. No stove, just a double hot plate. A small window air conditioner inadequately cools the room. When I went to close the front door, the doorknob came off in my hand.  (I repaired it using a table knife.) Even the location has its downside.  There is no parking in the area to speak of.  All parking on Beacon St. is reserved for residents.  There is metered parking on the side streets, but they revert to residents-only after 6:00 pm. Ravi had advised me of this earlier, but the holiday weekend and pending construction brought further parking restrictions in the area. The unit is advertised as four blocks from Fenway Park, but the blocks along Beacon are exceptionally long, and the \"\"four blocks\"\" add up to 1.2 miles according to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps.  We missed our appointment with Ravi thanks to a massive traffic jam"
414419,37630611,2015-07-08,2648878,Jaclyn,Perfect for a quick stay!
414419,38503425,2015-07-16,20183506,Joanne,We had the most wonderful time in Boston. Ravi was in contact with us to find out when our plane would land. He greeted us with the key and walked us through his charming and historic Air bnb. We learned how to use the air conditioning.  Ravi shared some water with us in the fridge. His apartment had a great selection of books.
"There were three of us so one person slept in the loft and the other two on the air mattress on the floor. We discovered a bit of a leak in the air mattress and Ravi came over quickly with a new air mattress. He wanted us to have a great stay which we did. Thanks Ravi.\"",,,,,

414419,38751806,2015-07-18,36803611,Lacey,"Ravi was a great host! Before arriving in Boston, Ravi reached out to me to let me know we could check-in anytime on our arrival day. That was great since our bus was delayed getting in. It was easy to communicate to him that we would be arriving later and it wasn't a problem. He met us at the apartment and told us about the area and gave us recommendations on where to go in the city. He even showed us places to go on a map and explained where each area was and what to do in every part of the city. It was very helpful!"
"The place was exactly how it looks in the pictures. It's a very cool studio. Bathroom was pretty small but he forewarns you about it. All four of us were very comfortable in the space (two slept in the bed and two on the air mattress provided). The neighborhood is wonderful with bars and restaurants just a few streets down and downtown Boston only about a 25 minute walk. All in all it was a great trip!\"",,,,,

414419,39481743,2015-07-24,9195336,Scooter,"Back Bay is such a wonderful area of Boston... Just walking everywhere was so pleasant. Ravi was easy to contact and talk to and staying in reach throughout our short stay.  The place is super cool, unique art and super high ceilings with a loft for a double bed.  The bathroom is super tiny, but the space is great for a couple, and a short stay for a few couples.  We loved it.... and we definitely would stay again!"
414419,39999160,2015-07-27,4388622,Ken,"This was a super-convenient place from which to visit Fenway and see the Sox on a rare winning night. Ravi met us and showed us everything we needed. The room is small but well-organized for convenience, with everything you need. There were four of us and it worked out great. Hard to beat for location in the heart of Back Bay."
414419,40105262,2015-07-28,6659636,Kelli,"Great apartment in a great location. Couldn't ask for better. Despite the size, there was plenty of sleeping space for our family of four. Very comfortable. I think it's about ten blocks from Back Bay Station."
414419,40960095,2015-08-03,12117506,Meghan,"Ravi's place was great and just as described. It was in a great location - less than a 10 minute walk to the T and about 15 minutes to Boston Commons and Garden. He provided drinks for us and made us feel very welcome! It is a bright, cozy studio and the bed was comfy. It was also great having clean sheets and towels provided for us. And the plethora of soap choices was a nice touch. I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Boston to stay here! Great spot!"
414419,41924005,2015-08-10,30004775,Fiona,My friends and I had a wonderful time in Boston and in Ravis apartment!
"He is a friendly and helpful host and made everything to make us feeling comfortable. \"",,,,,
414419,42849018,2015-08-16,34874750,Bryan,"Ravi is very kind and willing to answer every question we ask. His place is exactly like the photo shows,great location,coke in the fridge.Anyway it's a nice place to stay when you visit Boston!"
414419,43638093,2015-08-21,37214945,Yanhong,"Ravi is very kind and enthusiastic . The apartment is a good location, near the river, easy to go to Newburyport street, Copley square ,railway station. Though the restroom is very tiny but we can handle it."
414419,44337642,2015-08-25,7452366,John,Ravi was a great host. Check in went very smoothly and Ravi had great suggestions on local dining. The location can't be beat with many restaurants and shops within a few blocks. Also easy walking to Boston Commons via the formal gardens.  Also close to the Charles River and hike & bike trails. Very pretty neighborhood that is great for walking. The property is exactly as described.
414419,45254494,2015-09-01,16833578,Caroline,"Ravi was a great host! He was waiting for us when we got there - even though our flight was a little bit late. He showed us where everything was and then took off. The place is in a great location. We were in town to move myself and my brother back into school so it was the perfect place for both our schools. Back Bay is also a great neighborhood! It has lots of shops and restaurants. His place also had everything we needed and fit the three of us comfortably. All in all, it was a great experience!"
414419,46199027,2015-09-08,8531096,Florian,"We stayed for 3 nights in ravi's apartment. We had a great Airbnb, with a perfect location in backbay, only few blocks from the Charles river and from boylston st. He was very communicative and we didn't have a problem with a late check in / check out.  he also gave us recommendations in Boston during check in - much appreciate! I totally can recommend his apartment. The only complain would be the little bathroom - but which was not a problem at all for the stay."
414419,46867084,2015-09-14,30454317,Will,"Ravi's quaint apartment located in heart of Boston lived up to expectations. One of the main reasons we booked the apartment was due to the decor, which were amazing... Edges to say the least!"
A stones throw away from anything and everything it was a perfect little location for us as 'tourists'.,,,,,
Unfortunately out planes were severely delayed meaning we never actually got the opportunity to met Ravi but he was always in contact with us if we needed anything,making us feel very welcome.,,,,
"Overall the stay was outstanding and I would highly recommend Ravi's apartment for anyone travelling to Boston.\"",,,,,
414419,47250001,2015-09-17,11907548,Nina,"Great welcome from Ravi, really accommodating guy. Apt was really quirky and true to the description, location was perfect and as advertised definitely the best location in Boston.  Would definitely stay again!  Thanks!"
414419,48094669,2015-09-23,10219468,Stephen,"Ravi's apartment has  a lot going for it. It's a quirky apartment filled with interesting art and crafts in a great location for all of Boston's attractions. Newbury Street, Boston Common and the Freedom Trail are all within walking distance. Our arrival was delayed but Ravi waited and provided a comprehensive run down of the apartment's amenities and the locality including recommendations on shopping and restaurants. He clearly takes his role as AirBnB host seriously."
The apartment does have some limitations.  Ravi is right when he describes the bathroom as a tight squeeze and it shares it's sink with the kitchen. The shower has seen better days and would benefit from renovation. The kitchen has most utensils anyone will need but doesn't have a microwave,kettle or regular stove/oven. The mezzanine bed space works ok but some agility is needed to climb the ladder for access.,,,,
Despite the limitations we spent a great couple of days in Boston staying here. For me the apartment is reminiscent of student accommodation but it works well for two and is in a great location.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
414419,48269375,2015-09-25,10932039,Karina,"Ravi was more than attentive, helpful and communicative prior to our arrival and once we arrived. We met Ravi printed lots of information about things to do, the area we were located and verbally told us the great places to eat, where to get a great view of the city, etc. He was more than helpful. His apartment was as expected, very nicely decorated. Had a wonderful time at Ravi's place, would stay again."
414419,48875834,2015-09-29,37742976,Angela,"Ravi is a great host! He was incredibly flexible with check in/out. He was willing to meet us quite early in the morning which was nice. As mentioned in other reviews, the apartment is quirky and fun. The location was fantastic and we walked to many places. The bathroom was super small, as Ravi described, and I agree that it could benefit from an update. However, that didn't bother us too much and we would definitely stay again. Overall, I would recommend Ravi's apartment to my fellow travelers."
414419,49200578,2015-10-02,26610111,Marie,Ravi was very flexible in meeting us with the keys. He gave us a good run down of the place and area and was very helpful. The area is an excellent one ....both safe and close to areas that you will want to visit.
The unit IS small! Totally adequate for a couple and possibly a fun attraction for two young couples but it does have its limitations for older couples particularly in respect to sleeping facilities. Having said that,"we were very satisfied with our stay both in value and functionality.\"",,,,
414419,49423174,2015-10-04,33764654,Otto,"We arrived at Ravi's apartment to find him patiently waiting for us while we found a parking spot at Copley Square. Once done with that, we took the short walk of 5-6 blocks to his building. He was a knowledgeable and gracious host who made sure to give us the lay of the apartment, as well as answering any questions we had about the surrounding area and helping us with directions to a few locations we planned on visiting. The apartment was very clean with plenty of towels, bedding, and other amenities. Located in a beautiful section of Boston, I would highly recommend renting this location."
414419,49801618,2015-10-06,43222411,Cem,"Ravi is great host, he wellcomed us very warm and gave the reccomendation provided many materials for roaming around. His house in very nice location of Boston which is Beacon street just a 5-10minutes walk to most popular streets like newburry, common wealth and boylston , you can fell the history at house. Thanks him, Cem"

414419,51015795,2015-10-17,39965879,Theresa,"Excellent location! Close to everything and easy to get around. Cozy apartment (tiny bathroom, no sink) but was so busy walking around the neighborhood I didn't stay in much. Location is everything. And Ravi was kind and responded quickly to messages."
414419,51443697,2015-10-20,42680130,Alexandra,"Great location and a fun space! Walking distance to Hynes convention center, great shopping and sights. The studio was clean, comfortable and had good WIFI. Ravi was really flexible in arranging to meet me with the key and wanted to make sure I felt comfortable. He recommended places to eat and where to be careful traveling as a single woman at night. Plenty of clean towels, soap and shampoo. Look forward to my next stay!"
414419,52059155,2015-10-26,18822979,Chelsea,"I can't even say enough about Ravi or the location. Ravi was the most responsive and attentive host. Down to my inability to figure out how to close a window, he got back to me right away! He had a case of water for us in the fridge, so thoughtful, and with all our walking we went through it all. The apartment was absolutely perfect for us, we walked everywhere and loved being in that neighborhood. Not only was the neighborhood gorgeous, it was so close to everything we wanted to see. The night we got there Ravi gave us several tips and recommendations and we used them all. I had a blast!!!!!"
414419,52515268,2015-10-30,13384286,Mackenzie,Ravi met me on time at the apartment.  He showed me around the apartment and gave me tips on how to get around the city.  He was very welcoming.  The apartment is accurately pictured on the website.  Bed was comfy.  Get location--in a quiet safe neighborhood but only a 15 min ride downtown or 30 min walk to the heart of Boston.  Ravi was easy to get a hold of and arrived on time for key dropoff.  Definitely recommend this place to those who don't want the sterility of a hotel and want to stay in a unique place.  Perfect for couples.
414419,54130117,2015-11-16,31934980,Fuchsia,"Ravi was such a great host - he was friendly, communicative and above and beyond helpful. His place is cosy, clean and comfortable, and in an ideal location, the perfect place if you have a busy stay in Boston and are looking for somewhere easy and uncomplicated to stay. It's just a brief walk to the Hynes Convention Centre, and Ravi was very quick to offer recommendations of nearby spots to eat and have coffee etc. Two thumbs up."
414419,54360580,2015-11-18,7760321,Matt,"I recently spent 2 nights at Ravi's place and it was excellent! Completely as advertised and in a fantastic location. Though I only met Ravi briefly, he was exactly as helpful as my jet lagged brain required! Will definitely try an stay here again on my next trip to Boston."
414419,54595798,2015-11-22,19529359,Rory,Ravi was incredibly helpful. The place is exactly as it looks in the pictures and was in a perfect location to enjoy all of Boston's best spots. I couldn't recommend more for people looking to explore the city.
414419,55221414,2015-11-29,13202594,Kelsey,"This was the perfect location for my college girlfriends weekend getaway! Within walking distance to great restaurants and shops. The apartment was so unique, we loved it!  Although I was unable to meet Ravi, he made sure that we had everything we needed and left a descriptive message before we got there to make sure we didn't have trouble with anything."
414419,55596560,2015-12-02,11185431,Pablo,"Ravi's place was great for the price. Small, but well... it's Boston. Great location, perfect if you're coming for work and just need a place to crash."
414419,55845401,2015-12-06,26293659,Kelley,"True to the pictures, Ravi's place was extremely cozy and quaint. It was situated at a prime location in a very safe Neighbourhood with good shopping just a 5-min walk away."
"Ravi was also very quick in replying which was much appreciated! Would definitely recommend my friends to stay here\"",,,,,
414419,56437132,2015-12-13,43523603,Eline,"Ravi was a wonderful host, very friendly and inviting. He met us at the door, gave us a brief tour/intro of the apt, told us a bit about the building, the neighborhood, fun things to do around town, and answered all our questions. I also cannot speak more highly of the apt- such a great and funky compilation of art work, felt very homey. Great central location as well, a few blocks from Newbury (great restaurants and shopping)- we stowed the car in a parking garage for the weekend and were able to walk everywhere; beacon hill, boston common, Fenway park, the freedom trail and north end. Highly recommended!"
414419,57667183,2015-12-28,49135958,Lori,"This apartment was just perfect. The location is perfect on Beacon Street with walking distance to Back Bay, the Esplanade and the Public Garden.  The unit is front exposure with high ceilings that make the space very appealing.  Ravi was super easy to deal with and very helpful.  I highly recommend it!"
414419,57926578,2015-12-30,50534142,Jackson,"The best thing about this listing was the location. Ravi was a considerate and communicative host, and the place was as cute and eclectic as the listing states. However I had less of a positive experience than the other reviews indicate. (1) The studio was very hard to heat, probably due to the AC unit left in the window inexplicably during the winter months. Ravi was very responsive and showed us an additional space heater which helped, however both nights were very cold. The AC also let in a lot of noise from outside, in particular the construction happening across the street. (2) The bathroom was significantly more claustrophobic then the description indicates, easily the size of an airplane restroom. Pictures of the bathroom are conspicuously missing from the listing, and had I seen them I would have looked for other options. (3) We questioned the cleanliness of the bedding when we arrived. The comforter had several large red stains on it, and we found hairs in the sheets. Neither smelled freshly laundered. (4) The TV mentioned in the description is of much lower quality than the average TV these days and, at least within the confines of our visit, seemed to only offer the most basic of cable. (5) The loft bed was tricky to get in and out of, and required a lot of agility of us, a couple who would describe ourselves as fairly agile. In conclusion, I think the description glosses over the true nature of this apartment, and that the value is really not there. I find fault with anything in the listing that indicates that this studio is anything more than just an ideally located place to crash, but definitely not a place to ‘stay’."
414419,59261713,2016-01-08,50479077,Ajay,Had an last minute issue come up and had to cancel. Ravi was rest at working with me and coming up with a reasonable solution. Disappointed I didn't get to stay this trip but would definitely book again on future trips.
414419,59950765,2016-01-17,18211678,Erlend,Awesome place to stay in Boston. Convenient location and nice apartment. Would definitively come back.
414419,60099702,2016-01-18,54662993,George,"My stay was fantastic. The neighborhood is one of the nicest in Boston, and the spot itself was a very unique and eclectic unit. The artwork was so cool– I spent a good 20 minutes checking out all of the wall art and posters. As for amenities, the loft was very clean when I arrived. Towels, and bedding were cleaned, folded, and easy to find. No complaints at all. The host even had many pamphlets for local activities such as Duck Boat Tours and the Museum of Science. I will certainly seek out this place again when I come to stay in town!"
414419,60310245,2016-01-21,4388061,Suzie,Great experience staying in the Back Bay of Boston.  The apartment was located in a fun and convenient spot in the city and Ravi was very easy to communicate with about my stay.
414419,60663222,2016-01-25,46416670,Timur,"It was such a good experience staying at this apartment. Apartment is warm, accurate and neat. It's easy to get anywhere in Boston from this location."
414419,61678975,2016-02-07,29625197,Nadine,"Ravi was such a great host! I didn't get to meet him personally but he was very quick to respond to any question or issue that came up and was super accommodating. The place is exactly as listed-- beautiful, eclectic, and in the BEST location in Boston! Definitely a steal of a deal with the river just a block away and being within walking distance of TONS of cool restaurants, bars and shopping. Ravi provides everything you need (hairdryer, iron, dishes, flatware, towels etc.) to make the stay feel like you're at home. I will definitely be staying here again!"
414419,62364915,2016-02-14,26623922,MacKinley,Ravi was easy going and quick to respond to any questions we had. We really enjoyed the apartment and all the decorations. Great location and would definitely recommend.
414419,63249073,2016-02-21,58148168,Matt,"Ravi was extremely accommodating and responsive during our stay. His apartment is located very close to the Charles, Beacon Hill, and the Newbury st. I felt really welcome in his apartment and really enjoyed exploring the different (and eccentric) decor. The lofted bed was great and not difficult to get up or down into. The bathroom is fairly small and does not have a sink. This was not an issue for us. Ravi includes several air mattresses which is great if you are having more than 2 people staying. Overall had a great experience and a wonderful weekend in Boston. Would rent again!"
414419,63530017,2016-02-23,34070496,Logan,Ravi was an excellent host who prepared everything amazingly - down to the very last detail! The place was funky and nice - a great place to spend a couple of work days. It's in a GREAT location. I would absolutely stay here again because of the hospitality and the place!
414419,63556614,2016-02-24,42506200,Reid,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay. We ended up not being able to get to Ravi's place until after 10 p.m., but getting access inside was simple. Everything was clean and quaint. No complaints!"

414419,65167250,2016-03-11,53732044,Timothy,"Ravi was a fantastic host! Checking in and out was very easy and the apartment is very private, unique and a fun place to stay and makes you feel like a local. It's very close to shops and restaurants and also close to the Charles River where there are great scenic walking trails. My wife and I really enjoyed the apartment, it was very neat and clean and Ravi provided great site seeing information and helpful information about the city and transportation on the coffee table that was a great resource. If you want a great place to stay while in Boston, THIS IS IT!"
414419,65369231,2016-03-13,58887037,Shannon,"Had a great time staying at Ravi's. Never had the chance to meet him but he was very responsive. This AirBnB was a great place to stay and in the most ideal location. Everything is within walking distance (Newbury Street, Quincy Market, Fenway). I would absolutely stay here again."
414419,66033264,2016-03-19,47340853,Brenda,"WONDERFUL location, exactly as described--loved my stay. Will definitely stay at Ravi's in the future."
414419,66458139,2016-03-22,30940993,Nick,"Ravi was a great host and the apartment was awesome. Everything we needed, in a good location. He even let us check out late due to an extenuating circumstance."
414419,67133258,2016-03-27,34286160,Christy,"My husband,  daughter and I stayed over the weekend during an Anime convention ay the Hynes.  The apartment was the perfect location and just as described.  Ravi was quick with all communication and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  The space was a great size and so much more inviting than any place we have stayed in Boston.  The location and neighborhood were beautiful and within walking distracted of so much!  Next time we are in town,  we will definitely try and stay here again."
414419,67839220,2016-03-31,34086367,Trent,"I had a great time staying in Ravi's apartment. Although we weren't able to meet we easily made arrangements to access the apartment which was neat, clean and in a great location for exploring Boston. Would definitely recommend to friends and anyone visiting the Boston/Back Bay area."
414419,68811040,2016-04-06,3116295,Felipe,"Anfitrião gentil e acessível. A descrição do apartamento no anúncio está bastante fidedigna. Localização maravilhosa. Éramos três pessoas, duas dormiram na cama de casal e o terceiro num colchão de ar na sala. Recomendo bastante!"
414419,69097675,2016-04-09,5448855,Nikki,"Ravi was such a great host! He provided so much information about Boston and he even went out of his way to do research to help accommodate us. He made it very easy to get access to the apartment even though we arrived very late. He was always quit to reply to any questions or concerns that I had. The subway was a quick walk down the street , which made it very convenient to get to other parts of the city. All and all, the location was the perfect place for my Boston get away."
414419,69469193,2016-04-11,48577343,Katherine,"The hospitality was great, with a fantastic location. Apartment had tons of character, and was located in a perfect area. The biggest issue we ran into was the inconvenience of the bed being lofted with no outlets to charge phones near the bed. Overall great experience though."
414419,69952753,2016-04-15,53114156,Leigh,Ravi was always prompt to respond to email queries and access to the apartment was easy. Apartment in lovely location in Back Bay and looks exactly like the pictures - quirky and interesting furnishings. We would definitely stay here again when we head to Boston again.
414419,70691372,2016-04-19,35809881,Ross,"If you want to really experience the character of Boston, this is the spot for you. Amazing location with access to downtown, Charles River, Boston Commons, and Fenway.  Everything in Ravi's description of the studio is on point. The best aspect of his rental is the ease of communicating with Ravi. Never had the privilege of meeting him but he was extremely clear with all the instructions and answering any questions. I would definitely stay again."
414419,71269528,2016-04-24,49748849,Maria,The apartment was amazing! It was beautiful and perfect for a long weekend in Boston. Ravi was flexible with check-in and check-out times and provided everything we needed for our stay. The neighborhood is beautiful and in close proximity to all the Boston attractions. I would definitely stay here again.
414419,71809748,2016-04-28,67858570,Abidemi,"The studio apartment was right in the city centre, which was fantastic. I took a bus shuttle from the airport, which took about 10 min ($5), and stopped at Copley Sq. From there, I just walked to the apartment. The apartment is just as it is in the pictures; quirky, but homely. Most importantly,  it was very clean and well-maintained."
"Ravi was the perfect host - seriously. Nothing was too much trouble. I'll definitely be coming back!\"",,,,,
414419,72936049,2016-05-05,49902388,Luanne,"Best to ask for recent pictures so you can see what the place really looks like. Ask for pictures of the washroom and the shower as it is very tiny, old, moldy and musty. Upstairs neighbors partied every night which made it very difficult to sleep. Definitely not a 4 star accommodation  even though the rates are high. My husband moved to a hotel for a few nights to get some sleep. Location is very good, but it wasn't a restful stay especially for the price."
414419,73859714,2016-05-10,23793589,Judy,"Great position, close to centre, but way too small. Bed is up a ladder over the tiny kitchen, bathroom is a closet with barely room for a shower and toilet, no sink. Kitchen is only just adequate with minimal utensils and no space. As the bed is under the ceiling it is hot even with the windows wide open so quite difficult to sleep. The power switches are dodgy and one of the portable hot plates doesn't turn off properly. No toaster and no microwave. TV had no instructions so we had to ring Ravi to sort it. The Air BnB listing gave no indication of the bed being up a ladder above the door."
414419,74368122,2016-05-15,22005946,Lauren,"\"Ravi was an excellent and accommodating host. He was very responsive and very helpful. He checked in on us throughout the stay to make sure we had everything we needed. We asked for a restaurant recommendation and he responded promptly with some fantastic recommendations. The apartment is small, but is a good fit for two. It's in a great location - walking distance to Boston Common and Fenway. Parking is tough since the neighborhood is all permit parking, so do your research before you arrive. This place was perfect for two \"\"out of towners\"\" exploring a new city! Thanks"
414419,74963452,2016-05-17,31436371,Mengyuan (Elaine),"The apartment is really neat, and the location is perfect! I would definitely recommend this place if you have a group of two."
414419,75336818,2016-05-20,22689852,Sara,Ravi's place was great. It was exactly how he described it and the location is unbelievable. I felt right at home!
414419,75560244,2016-05-22,59410797,Maria,"Ravi was very nice and accommodating! I loved how he decorated his apartment.. He is an excellent host! We live in Hawaii and it was our first time in Boston and staying at Ravi's place helped us get more into the Boston vibe. Love the decorations! Same road as Cheers too, my husband was so happy!"
414419,76325716,2016-05-26,13268573,Ilaria,"My family and I had a great time at Ravi's apartment. The building itself was located in a lovely neighborhood, very close to the Charles river esplanade and the subway. The apartment itself was very nicely decorated and had a very artsy vibe. The beds were extremely comfortable - even the air mattress he provided for my parents to sleep on. Staying at Ravi's place really ensured we made the most out of our time in Boston"
414419,76929765,2016-05-29,31837897,Elizabeth,"While the apartment's physical description provided was completely accurate, we did have an issue with the host not being present at our pre-arranged arrival time. We called and messaged the host, and after a stressful wait of two hours, we finally received a message from Ravi apologising and letting us know the code to a lockbox. Apart from that unpleasant start to our stay, we were very happy with Boston and the safe, friendly, and charming apartment and it's location."
414419,77732509,2016-06-03,58404279,Tracy,Ravi was great!! Location was perfect.. we walked everywhere! !
414419,78843222,2016-06-09,44406216,Wyn,Ravi kept in touch throughout giving instructions on getting to the address. The address is a quaint flat and perfect for visiting Boston. The area was really nice easily accessible to all the sights and bars and restaurants. The flat is interesting with a lot of curiosities.
414419,79448080,2016-06-12,1526950,Jen,Ravi's place was great! It's in a wonderful location and it's full of character. Ravi did a great job explaining the ins and outs of the place and provided everything we could need to have a great stay!
414419,80825308,2016-06-19,49860133,Joseph,"Ravi was a GREAT host, left us to our own devices. His place was clean, he was pretty responsive by text and message through the AirBnb Website. He was knowledgeable about all of our questions. And the best part, SUPER flexible and easy check-in and check-out process!"

414419,81691517,2016-06-24,5879674,Markus,"Staying at Ravi's place in Boston is our first Airbnb experience and it was nice.   His apartment is on the second floor of a brownstone which is in a GREAT location from which to explore a wonderful city.   It's a couple blocks away from Harvard bridge, 10 min to Copley Square, subway is nearby; the walking routes are easy and interesting (eg. the architecture).  We never met Ravi but he ensured a smooth process through messaging that let us get into the apartment via a lock box which was nice after a long day of traveling.  If other host's communication is as good as Ravi's was with us then we will certainly continue to book through Airbnb.   Yes, the apartment is small, the bathroom very small, the bed is a climb up loft but in just 2 nights stay it grew on us and offered an experience you just won't find in a hotel."
414419,82284629,2016-06-27,28589644,Christine,"The apartment was everything we needed and more, and Ravi was a great host! The location was perfect; central to everywhere you'd want to visit and minutes away from delicious food and wonderful views. We'll definitely be back again!"
414419,84175456,2016-07-05,39077651,Michael,"The apartment was exactly as listed. Since it was a hot 4th of July weekend we were especially glad to have cold bottled water at the ready in the refrigerator when we arrived. Sleeping in a lofted bed was a new and fun experience. The neighborhood was clean and had great access to Newbury and Boylston Streets for shopping during the day when we were having fun being tourists. For the fireworks, we were able to get on and off the Esplanade as needed which was a welcome relief from the heat and the press of the crowds."
Thanks again for a wonderful 4th of July,"Ravi!\"",,,,
414419,84461418,2016-07-07,54663278,Melissa,My family and I had a great time staying at this studio and felt that it was a great way to feel like part of the city.  Ravi was very great at communicating with us whenever we needed it.

The only hitch in our stay was parking,it is resident only on all streets but one. Glad everything was in walking distance!,,,,

414419,88026616,2016-07-22,4232208,Jaye,"Ravi gave us all the information we needed to access the apartment, as we had a late arrival time.  The apartment was one of several in a brownstone in Back Bay and the location could not have been more ideal.  It was close to Newbury Street, which is teaming with shops, restaurants and nightlife.  It was a short walk to the subway station."
The apartment was clean and had lots of interesting posters and artwork,just like the photos.  The space was small and would be ideal for two (preferably a couple),but we had 5 people and had to move a few things to make room for air mattresses.  The bathroom was tiny and the only sink was in the kitchen area.  It was a very hot couple of days in Boston while we were there and we needed to use the window unit AC.  Ravi left us a case of bottled water,"which was a nice touch and much appreciated.  The wifi worked just fine.\"",,

The building is very quiet and the neighborhood is lovely.  We found the neighbors to be very friendly. We had our dog with us and met many people that way."
Ravi was very easy to work with. He was quick to respond to any questions we had and made sure we had everything we needed for a good stay.,,,,,

We were within walking distance to Fenway Park, the Boston Common and many other fun tourist stops ... Ravi's loft was exactly as he stated and so lively with the art and layout of the apartment ... Cool/comfortable furniture and lots of Boston area maps and pamphlets to help your stay along.  Ravi was prompt, informative and friendly the whole way along... We have already recommended his place to others and would come back to stay again ourselves."

The location was amazing- in a lovely neighborhood and walking distance to just about anything you could need or want to see. (I cannot stress how nice of a location this is in.)

My husband, son, and I were visiting friends who lived in a building around the corner from Jesse's place, so the location could not have been better. It was an easy walk to the B, C, and D line trains as well. Jesse's place was clean, updated, and just as described in the listing, and Jesse himself was very responsive to anything we needed. We are thankful to have found this place, and we would definitely stay here again in the future!"

6695,8063,2009-08-23,24420,Patrick,We stayed in the private home / condo. A nice and quiet appartment. Very tastefull furnished and decorated. We really felt home !

6695,21716,2009-12-29,39051,Gerard,"I stayed here for a week over Christmas and it couldnt have been a nicer place to stay, Terry stayed away (thought i wouldnt have minded him saying hello)so it made the place feel like my own home with me being able to come and go at my leasure and he even left out some things to make my stay even more enjoyable. Location is great once you know how to use the quick train service into Boston. Only down side was it seemed that the heating was on only when it was turned on up stairs and the radiator was very noisy, other than that, a great place to stay."
6695,26412,2010-02-15,50820,Lam,I spent my Valentine at Terry's place and he left a beautiful bottle of wine and some chocolate that day. I really appreciated his kindness and the place was marvelous.

It has easy access to all kinds of public transport and is just a terrific place to stay for making the most of Boston. We were attending a conference that had us hopping to meetings and events all over Boston and Cambridge, but were always able to make it back easily using public transportation, even after the subway closed. The kitchen is a wonderful place to gather here and Terry is a very thoughtful, attentive, and accommodating host himself. Would really love to return again."

Terry's spot has a classic Boston feel with hardwood floors, exposed brick, etc.  The apartment is cozy and has a well equipped kitchen, good heating, DVD player and all the amenities you need.  It's a short walk to the Roxbury Crossing subway station and the overall value is great considering you'd pay double for a decent hotel room in the city."
Terry was a great host and offers tips and tricks for touring the city,grabbing food,etc.  Would highly recommend staying here!,,,

The neighborhood is not the most central in Boston, but there is plenty of parking which helps when you have a car. Terry was a great host - helpful when needed, and invisible the rest of the time. I'll definitely consider staying there again next time I'm in Boston. The wireless Internet connection was very fast and reliable."

6695,4393715,2013-05-02,1781034,Marvin,"This was my first trip to Boston, so I took a bit of a shot with this listing because I didn't know the neighborhoods or lay of the land at all. But the location turned out to be perfect - I lucked out. You will be roughly the equivalent of three city blocks from the T (Orange line Roxbury Crossing) if you cut through Roxbury Community College campus. From there, you're two stops from Mass Ave and Tremont and a short walk to trendy South End, or hop on the #1 bus and be on Newbury in 10 minutes. Go one more stop to Back Bay and your in Copley Square or Boston Commons The apt itself, is beautiful. It's quiet, handy, full of amenities, and Terry could not have been more courteous and helpful. I rented a car for a couple day-trips and parking on Centre Street was a breeze, and it was a quick shot east to I-93 with easy access to the cape, beaches, airport, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Maine. I had a perfect vacation, due largely to the fact that I had a great and convenient place to stay. Thanks Terry!!"
6695,4446364,2013-05-06,2723495,Elizabeth & Dan,The Fort Hill Inn was remarkably convenient and comfortable! With the quiet surroundings and plush bed I got the best sleep ever on a Boston trip. Don't need earplugs to sleep here! Our guest who used the sofa bed had no complaints either.
We were so busy we did not have a chance to use the well equipped kitchen.The coffee from Butterfly Coffee/Cafe at Roxbury Crossing was so good! No decaf at Butterfly but coffee very smooth nonetheless.,,,,,
"The \"\"Hubway\"\" positioned right at the T station made it super convenient to rent a bike and see the city. Just remember to check that bike in every 30 minutes to a Hubway bike stand. We biked along the Charles and over to Old Ironsides in Charlestown to be tourists and then back. Biked over to Newbury Street for dinner at Stephanie's later that evening. Absolutely exhilarating and such fun!",,,,,
Had a mechanical problem with a door lock that Terry took care of immediately much to our relief. Terry is very responsive and we felt we were in good hands.,,,,,

6695,6734665,2013-08-23,294553,Renee,"I was a bit nervous about staying here due to reviews about safety. Rest assured, this area is super safe. Do not take a cab here. Cab drivers only know downtown. Take the T, its cheaper and easier. Terry greeted us and broke down the area for us. We love the layout of the apartment.  Our only hiccup was the shower as the temperature was all over the place but that's wasn't a big deal to us as we live in NYC and in our apts the same thing can happen.  Plan to eat at The Squealing Pig in Mission Hill it has a great vibe and food. For most of the trip, plan to eat the Back Bay Area as there are some great places around the house but not as many options as we New Yorkers are use to. We had the run of the second apartment and very much enjoyed our stay. If you have any questions, Terry is a text away. We would return to The Fort Hill Inn in any future visits to the area."

6695,8447974,2013-10-31,2895852,Joanie,"Bar none, the best accommodations I have experienced on AirBnb!"
Beautifully furnished,thoughtfully appointed,it covered everything.  Terri has a great eye,which makes for a more comfortable stay.  He has thought of EVERYTHING,from offering not-run-of-the-mill guides (even a large,laminated map of Boston tastefully set on the coffee table; great for easier planning)
A good host pays attention to the details!,,,,,
Incredibly convenient,Terri's place is a leisurely 3-5 minute walk to public transportation.  Area layout:  T station,Community College directly across the street,then Terri's place behind that.  That easy!,,
Being that there is a police station within visible distance of the block,always an extra assurance to a traveler.  A few minutes in any direction will take you to some great museums (Isabella Stewart Gardner!),pubs,architecturally gorgeous churches.  What a nice suburban insight,off the beaten path.  Terri's neighborhood is beautiful and friendly.,
You can't go wrong with Terri's place.  It's your home away from home,maybe even a little bit better.  Incredible deal and value for such luxury.  Why pay the same price for some generic chain that is the same in Oklahoma,Washington,"or Ohio?  Go for something more memorable and personal.  :)\"",,
6695,9103225,2013-12-07,4586728,Hilary,"Convenient to the T and in a quiet little cul-de-sac. There was always a place to park, too.  Comfortable furnishings and the kitchen had what we needed to cook some food for ourselves (pots, pans, etc.).  We were there for work and didn't have much free time in the neighborhood but we did take a walk up to the park at the top of the hill and it was very scenic - William Lloyd Garrison's house was on the way back!  Will definitely be back for our next trip!"

6695,13339566,2014-05-26,476856,Francis,Terry was an excellent host responding promptly to all enquiries before and after our booking.  We actually only met him very briefly during our stay as we were out a lot.
The fact that we only met him this once is a testament to the effective arrangements he has in place for checking in and checking out. Also,we found everything in the apartment was in working order therefore there was no need to trouble him.,,,,
The apartment was as described in the listing and in excellent shape with clear instructions on various matters. Strong Wi-Fi signal was available.,,,,,
The neighborhood was fine. It was fairly quiet and we always felt safe. The Roxbury Crossing ‘T’ station is a short 4 to 5 minute walk away and with trains every 10 minutes or so you are downtown in no time at all (10 minute ride to Downtown Crossing).,,,,,
If you are staying for more than a couple of days an $18 MBTA weekly pass is excellent value as it includes trains,buses and the inner harbor water taxi. It is also very easy to travel to/from the airport using the ‘T’ (approx. 40 min) saving on expensive taxis/ shuttles.,,,,
Cannot comment on local shopping,as we tended to bring in groceries from the excellent Wholefoods Market in downtown Boston.,,,,
We had a great time in Boston and if we return to the city we would be delighted to stay at Terry’s place again.,,,,,

6695,13953399,2014-06-09,13606185,Natalie,Terry was quick to respond to all messages.  We did not have any interaction with Terry while we were in town but I have no doubt that he would have responded quickly if we needed anything.  As a testament to his wonderful planning his apartment was easily found based on his directions.  A quick walk from the T.  We did not rent a car while in Boston as the public transportation was so easy to manage and so close to the condo.  There were tons of information regarding tourist spots in the condo in case you want to look for additional places to go.  Wifi was great along with the cable tv.  We did not make use of the kitchen but it was nicely equipped.  Terry's condo was approximately half the price of a hotel during the time period we stayed and we had MORE room than a hotel.  Very comfortable furnishings.  This being our first airbnb experience has made us look further into using this service for future trips.

This apartment  offers everything needed in a great location, close to subway station, with free parking available. As described and I highly recommend it!"
6695,17064904,2014-08-06,15435912,Lynne,"Terry was a great host, extremely accommodating and lovely to deal with. He met us on check in and left us with maps and recommendations of things to do, see and restaurants to go to in Boston."
"Only a 5min walk to the T (subway) and 15mins into the centre of Boston.  The apartment was nicely furnished and had everything that we needed - we would definitely stay here again.\"",,,,,
6695,17454544,2014-08-12,17783368,Kevin,Quel endroit parfait! Nous avons eu l'impression de vivre comme de vrai Bostoniens. L'emplacement très près du T a grandement facilité nos déplacements et nous y reviendront lors de notre prochain passage à Boston. Terry est très accueillant et l'appartement était parfait sous tout point de vue.
6695,18882761,2014-09-02,14341456,Monica,We had a very pleasent stay.
The apartment was in excellent condition,very comfortable,spacious and very clean. The apartment that shows the photos is not the same as that which we arrived. The bedroom and the bathroom are in the basement,where the noise of the air conditioning was noted.,,
In the apartment there are maps of the city and tourist information.,,,,,
WIFI works very good.,,,,,
The neighborhood: it is very quiet. We had a car,and found enough space to park free. We used it every day,especially to avoid the night walk from the subway station to the house,the trip is not long but it is lonely.,,
Terry: received us on arrival,"very friendly and helpful. We only bothered him to help us open the suitcase because we had lost the key to the lock and he solved the issue very efficiently. The rest of the time we communicate by email\"",,,,
6695,19130097,2014-09-07,14252773,Chun,"It is a really nice apartment. We love it very much. The only problem is the bedroom is underground, it is not easy to get into."
6695,19593709,2014-09-15,4743495,Maryse,Mande un mensaje a Terry informándole de que íbamos a llegar antes de la hora prevista y
se mostró conciliador y permitiéndonos dejar nuestras maletas,al final la limpieza estaba acabada y pudimos instalarnos. Apreciamos la flexibilidad y la buena disposición. Terry nos acogió con mucha amabilidad y nos proporciono información interesante sobre Boston. La casa se correspondía al anuncio,muy limpia,acogedora y con sensación de hogar. Nos sentimos muy a gusto. Las comunicaciones con la T son cercanas y rápidas.,,
Sin embargo creo necesario añadir que la zona puede parecer algo insegura,"advertencia que nos hizo el taxista que nos llevo allí. No tuvimos ninguna mala experiencia pero sí uno es sensible con este tema esto no es una buena opción.\"",,,,
6695,21337368,2014-10-15,5274836,Gabriela,"This is a great place to stay in Boston! Well furnitured, clean, full kitchen with all you can need... This place is about just a 5 min walk to a metro station. And Terry is the best host you can ever met! Attentious, answered us very quick, helpful..."
"This definitly is a place in Boston that we will stay again! Thanks Terry for everything! You are just great!\"",,,,,
6695,21855499,2014-10-25,15872528,Seunghee,It's a beautiful & clean classic house. I was very satisfied with the place and host.
6695,28106699,2015-03-17,26593991,Trang,"Listing was very accurate. Terry was very informative and he answered all my questions during my stay very quickly. The place was clean, cute and very homy. The kitchen was fully supplied. The place was however very cold at night."
6695,51724950,2015-10-24,43132177,Jan,Apartment was as shown and quite comfortable. Appreciated Terry's flexibility with our arrival and departure times.

6695,71347850,2016-04-24,18601159,Jennifer,"The Fort Hill Inn was a very nicely renovated brick row house on a tiny dead end side street.  The immediate neighborhood felt very safe, had close access to the T, and best of all had easy access to free parking, as we had traveled to Boston in 2 cars.  The delightful host Terry was in and out of the property (I believe he lives upstairs) and was available to assist us in anything we needed--including recommending an auto service shop as we encountered some car trouble on our travels.  Plenty of maps and Boston guides as well as some Uber coupons left for us on the mantel.  We felt so comfortable and at home in the beautifully decorated apartment--an eclectic mix of old, thrift, fancy and useful-- Terry has a great eye for what you would expect to find in this kind of building! Plus the kitchen was well stocked with essential items for cooking.  Although we had a car with us, we preferred using the T and Uber during our stay so we didn't have to deal with driving headaches in downtown Boston.  The location of this apartment made that easy and economical.  We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay at this place and will definitely stay here again when we come back to Boston!!"
6695,76357016,2016-05-26,22345610,Luis,"This was just as advertised!  I thought the location was almost perfect. Not too close to the tourist area but not too far. If you plan on using this location and have a vehicle, be aware that Tueday mornings is tricky. Streets are cleaned between 8-12 so make plans to leave before 8.  I couldn't easily find a place to park and I ended up getting a parking ticket."
"The unit itself was awesome. Very home like and clean. Would definitely recommend.\"",,,,,
11120777,66060545,2016-03-19,31249000,Monica,"AWESOME location! My husband and I are locals but we wanted to show our family that was visiting from out of town the city at night without driving home. We had more than enough room for 4 adults, the apt was decorated beautifully and the location was easily walk able to all downtown attractions. Thanks for letting us stay!!!"
11120777,66441630,2016-03-22,10295704,Sarah,"Great area in the nicest Boston neighborhood, very nice apartment, provided all the amenities listed."
11120777,67220908,2016-03-27,54184175,Marie,"This apartment was the perfect place to stay in Boston: perfectly located, very spacious and absolutely clean and beautiful. The only little problem was the noise in the morning in the room that faces the street (but I guess that's the same thing everywhere)."
"I did not have the chance to meet Paige but all was perfectly organized for our arrival.\"",,,,,
11120777,68112984,2016-04-02,58717705,Rahat,The House was very beautiful and the best was it was close to the train station and the river . Paige was. Very responsive
11120777,68361604,2016-04-04,93783,Karen,"Paige's place was ideally located for exploring the city, and there's a garage across the street where we left our car for the trip. The apartment has beautiful furniture and the beds were comfortable. Paige had left small shampoo, etc. for us which was fantastic since we forgot ours! There's a bar below the apartment, where people congregate outside until about 2am. The noise didn't bother us since we were out ourselves mostly, but if you are looking for a quiet place at night then this area may not your best choice. It's also more noticeable in the front rooms - the master bedroom couldn't hear much. Overall, we enjoyed our trip and the apartment!"
11120777,69506422,2016-04-11,8303631,Elizabeth,"Very cute apartment, spacious and comfortable beds! Worked well for 5 guests. Paige was very helpful and let us check in early, as our flight arrived in morning. GREAT location in Beacon Hill. Steps to everything. I definitely recommend!"
11120777,71297174,2016-04-24,49832158,Sam,"Paige was a wonderful hostess. The apartment was bigger than the pictures gave credit for. For five people, we never felt cramped or uncomfortable. Very centrally located and the neighborhood is so picturesque. It never took us more than 10 minutes to get anywhere we had planned. The beds were so comfy and the furniture was very well picked out. My favorite was the kitchen table! We can not wait to rent this or other places from Paige in the future! She was always very easy to get a hold of and very helpful."
11120777,72295055,2016-05-01,19314808,Curtis,As described! And great location. The best in Boston honestly.  Paige was also very helpful and responsive

Rooms are spacious,comfortably accommodate 4 persons.,,,,
Location is amazing,walking distance to lots of popular restaurants and grocery stores. Also within one minute to Red Line. Life is a lot easier in this area.,,,,
Anyway,"can't recommend it enough. \"",,,,
11120777,74702727,2016-05-16,62420061,Stephanie,Couldn't have asked for a better host! Paige made everything very simple from booking to checking in and out. I would definitely stay or book with her again!

"Thank you for a nice place to stay. Vintage place in the heart of everything! \"",,,,,
11120777,76123860,2016-05-24,4229642,Sung,Great location on Charles Street and next to the Red Line. Clean and professionally decorated. Paige made everything very simple. Highly recommended!
11120777,76370157,2016-05-26,57689437,Narisa,"The apartment is in Beacon Hills, a very nice area with many restaurants and shops. It's located very close to the Charles Street stop on Red Line, so very convenient. The apartment is as described. Paige was very nice in that she allowed us to store our luggage before check-in time. We had 5 people in our party, and she had the cleaning person set up the air mattress."
11120777,78320980,2016-06-06,54863305,Mark,Great location - very historic.  We enjoyed the uniqueness of your apartment.
11120777,79195556,2016-06-11,35442849,Janet,Beacon hill was a wonderful place in Boston to stay and Paige was very accommodating and accessible at all times.
The apartment was lovely and very comfortable.,,,,,
Having the train station so close was great as we had quite a bit of luggage.,,,,,
The proximity to wonderful cafes,shops and the park made our stay very relaxing.,,,,
"Highly recommend this lovely apartment.\"",,,,,
11120777,80988554,2016-06-20,31637564,Anne,"This place was amazing!!! It was in a perfect location and had everything we needed for a perfect Boston experience. Paige was a wonderful host, so easy to contact and very accommodating. I will definitely come back to Boston and stay here it was wonderful"
11120777,83132721,2016-07-01,76102457,Deb,"We had a great stay at Paige's Charles Street apartment which had an excellent location with close proximity to Boston Mass General Hospital, Boston Common, great restaurants and shopping.  The apartment is tastefully decorated with French touches and is warm and welcoming."
11120777,84664749,2016-07-08,63830457,Alejandra,This is the perfect location in Boston to stay if you are wanting to experience city living.  Beautiful 2 bedroom close to everything!
11120777,86243104,2016-07-15,71939229,鸿雁,Very nice!We don't want to leave!We hope next meetings!
11120777,87712930,2016-07-21,31016404,Scott,"We had a fantastic experience. The apartment was spacious, clean, and in a fantastic location for exploring the city.  Check in was super easy.  Neighbors were quiet. Great food and grocery stores available in minutes. We loved it!"
11120777,88811847,2016-07-25,53888819,Lauren,Paige was VERY responsive - always getting back to me almost immediately. The home is very nicely decorated and looks very much like the pictures. It's also very spacious for a city apartment! The hallway going up the stairs is pretty narrow and landings are small- something to be aware of if you have large suitcases.
The neighborhood is amazing! Such a great location. We took the train to Boston South Station and hopped right onto the redline to get to the apartment. It could not have been easier! We walked EVERYWHERE we could have wanted to go: around Charles Street,down to the Common and to Newbury Street. We walked to dinner in the North End,to Faneuil Hall,and Long Wharf. From there we even made our way down to the theatre district and SoWa. We could have walked over to Cambridge/MIT area but that would have been a longer walk - but there's a pedestrian bridge which would have been safe and easy.,,
The CVS on the corner is open 24 hours so anything we needed last minute was available. The liquor store is literally right next door,and ice cream across the street. The boutiques are adorable (if $$) and the Paramount for breakfast and Pressed Juice Bar were only a couple of blocks away. The parking garage across the street was super convenient and if you book online in advance it's MUCH cheaper - almost half the price! We couldn't have stayed in a better located or safer neighborhood.,,,,
FYI there is not central air,but window unit AC,which can be a bit more noisy than central.  Beds were firm & comfortable and the air mattress was the kind that is tall and off the floor with a pump that both fills and deflates itself which was great. The room with the king size bed fit the queen size air mattress in it,and while we were a bit cramped it was nice not to have someone sleeping in the living room! Only thing we found a bit strange was that half the kitchen cabinets were locked up as well as all the clothes closets so there was just one small spot with a curtain near the front door to hang coats,dresses,"etc. It got a bit crowded in there - so I would keep that in mind if you are visiting in the winter. \""
11120777,90743585,2016-08-02,43390724,Matt,Absolutely gorgeous and spacious apartment in one of the best neighborhoods! Paige was an excellent host who was very accommodating of our needs. Wish we could have stayed longer. Will definitely be back!
11120777,91516588,2016-08-05,57971872,Halla,Very charming apartment. Quiet building. Spacious living room and dining room. Great location. 2 minute walk to the Red Line. CVS and loads of restaurants and shops on Charles Street. Having AC was great at the end of a long day. Everything in the kitchen was conducive for a simple meal. Beds were comfortable. Safe neighborhood.
11120777,94490109,2016-08-15,66364368,Peg,The unit was very comfortable and clean. It was fun staying on Charles street with all its shops and restaurants. Charlez street is busy but safe. The unit is quiet and is walking distance to so many Boston sights.
5269216,27664926,2015-03-09,14021048,Michael,"Our stay with Will at this apartment was very pleasant. It was clean and had plenty of space for our group of 6.  All of the appliances and kitchen-ware was updated and awesome. Everything was clean upon our arrival, and we had essentially everything we needed. Internet was fast."
5269216,28618875,2015-03-27,1746811,Jon,"Conveniently located, charming and spacious place. Beautifully clean and fully equipped. Effortless communication. Worth every penny. Would love to come back in the summer and enjoy the patio. Thanks!"
5269216,28727069,2015-03-29,28673527,Adam,"Excellent stay, the apartment was lovely, very clean, had all the provisions we needed and is in a great location. Will made the transaction super easy with no-fuss whatsoever. I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for more than a hotel in Boston."
5269216,29279591,2015-04-06,4955490,Laura,"The apartment was great. It was spacious, clean and just what I was expecting according to the photos and descriptions. The neighborhood is kind of hard to describe because it is right on the border between a nice area and a sketchy one, but it is still really great location wise, it is easy to get anywhere around Boston. It is definitely worth it if you are looking for a place with three bedrooms modern and well kept, which is hard to find in Boston."
5269216,30175746,2015-04-18,31226821,Valeria,"The apartment is nice and exactly as per pictures, with everything you need for a short stay. Modern features easy access, as per description."
My 3 star rating is mainly due to communication issues.  We stayed there for 2 nights only and had to call management 3 times.  Kitchen floor was dirty (muddy footsteps) when we arrived,fire alarm was disconnected from ceiling and on the kitchen table.,,,,
We could not access wifi at all on the first night and when we were able to speak with manager (next morning),he said that the codes on the welcome book had changed and gave us a new code (why not update the book ?). Still didn't work,so he had to come around to sort the router.  TV also did not work for the first night - we tried several times with the remote control,with no luck. We found out that there was another remote that worked,but it was hidden under the coffee table and we only found it the next morning.,
After we left the apartment and paid in full,I wrote to the owner and mentioned the above incidents with further detail,asking for a good will refund of at least part of the cleaning fee.  Owner graciously thanked for all the info to be better and improve experience for next customers but disregarded my refund request.,,,
Although apartment is nice,service is not what I expected.,,,,

5269216,31334003,2015-05-04,11428137,Nori,Great place and location! There were 6 of us and we all slept comfortably and had quite a bit of space. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place to anyone! The only difficulty was that the wifi was not working and it was hard to get in touch with anyone.
5269216,32163758,2015-05-15,28450725,Brian,The unit was clean and nicely updated.  My coworkers and I enjoyed being able to cook breakfast in the morning and relax in the living room in the evenings.
The kitchen could have used a few basics to make it more usable,like simple seasonings,coffee filters,etc.  Needing to buy every single ingredient for a 5 night stay seemed a little unnecessary.  We were also led to believe there was a grill at our disposal,but sadly there was no propane tank.,
Otherwise,the neighborhood rides the line between South End gentrification and the sketchy side of Mass Ave,"but overall it was convenient for us.  There are tons of restaurants and stores that you can walk to.\"",,,
5269216,33495206,2015-05-29,27530721,Kevin,"This is indeed a very beautiful 3 bdrm unit - nicely appointed with modern furnishings - and in a wonderfully convenient location to visit the Boston area - close to the T, very easy to get to most of the Boston area attractions.  We stayed here for the week of our son's commencement ceremonies and were very comfortable as a 4 person group.  Upon our arrival, the unit was clean and amenities stocked.  We made use of the beautiful kitchen facilities during our stay, the beds were large and comfortable, the bathrooms clean, hi-speed wifi worked superbly, nice large flat-screen HDTV, nice garden area to sit outside, more than ample closet space and storage for our luggage... in short, a perfect rental for us!  We could not have been any happier with our accommodations!  Thank-you Will!"

5269216,34945655,2015-06-14,29924931,Kelly,"This was a great spot for a long weekend in Boston. It was a 25 minute walk to Fenway and into downtown Boston. The unit was clean, secure and had everything we needed (linens, towels, appliances, ice). The back patio was nice to have for dinner and drinks. My only complaint is that it was a bit warm. There was a thermostat but it didn't seem to hook up to any cooling system. There were fans in 2 of the 3 bedrooms. Other than that- - a great find in a pricy Boston market!"
5269216,37593801,2015-07-08,3596862,Jonathan,"This was the perfect place for me, my wife, my mom, my aunt and my sister while we visited Boston for my brother's wedding. The place looks exactly as it does in the pictures, and is super comfortable. The outdoor space was great, too. Very clean and check-in/check-out is very easy with the codes in lieu of keys. For those with mobility issues, bear in mind the entrance to the building is up a short flight of stairs from the street and down a full flight of stairs down to the garden level."

5269216,38098828,2015-07-13,28592045,Susan,We had a wonderful 5-night stay in this apartment.  It is very clean and full of natural light and everything is new.  It is an easy walk to the orange line which connects you to all sorts of places in Boston and beyond.  We often came back to the apartment at night and always felt safe in the neighborhood.
5269216,38857132,2015-07-19,4618553,Robin And Cory,"Great apartment! We had 5 adults staying here and did not feel cramped even though it's not a huge apartment. Really nice finishes and comfortable furniture. The location was great with a few places within a block or two plus easy access to the rest of the city.

5269216,39371266,2015-07-23,28569260,Maria,La estancia en la casa fue estupenda.
Todo está completamente nuevo y sobre todo muy limpio,gracias a un alojamiento así pudimos disfrutar mucho de la ciudad. Además la parada de metro queda muy cerquita por lo que hace que sea perfecto para una estancia corta y conocer Boston.,,,,
Éramos cuatro personas y pudimos dormir sin problema porque las habitaciones son súper espaciosas.,,,,,

Le logement était conforme à la description. Toutefois pour déjeuner à sis dans la cuisine c'est un peu limite aux niveaux des espaces. Il a fallu récupérer deux chaises supplémentaires dans le jardin,,,,,
Une des chambres était prévu pour une personne. Il a fallu positionner le clic clac pour deux personnes. Les draps n’étaient pas vraiment prévus pour un lit à deux adultes. La place est assez limitée,,,,,
Le quartier est très agréable à proximité d'une station de métro.,,,,,
L'appartement en sous sol est agréable et calme. Tout est prévu pour la cuisine.,,,,,

Only one thing that I misunderstood (my fault) is the room was not a same level of the street. So it was a little difficulty for senior guys to bring big baggages.,,,,,
Metro stations and bus stops are near and we could reach everywhere in the city easily.,,,,,
Equipped TV was nice though the instruction was wrong. We hustled for a while to display. Need correction of welcome binder. (wifi SSID and password in this binder was also wrong),,,,,

We would highly recommend this place for two couples who want to enjoy everything Boston has to offer.,,,,,

5269216,56271765,2015-12-11,15434421,John,Will is an excellent host. Communication was stellar. Any questions we had were either laid out for us in the guide they have in house or were answered promptly. Space is really great. Plenty of room for three adults. Pictures are 100% accurate. Everything in the place from furniture to appliances was new and worked perfectly. The little garden patio area was great too.
5269216,56596888,2015-12-15,10822707,David,"This apartent was just like perfect for what we needed. We stayed three nights, everything was as described, access was easy since they don't provide keys but entrance codes."
Everything was clean,"the neighborhood is a perfect spot with everything you need around. \"",,,,

Family of 5 comfortable stay. Great location. Fun neighborhood. Many restaurants an easy walk. Arrival and check in made simple. Whole Foods just 10 minute walk. Perfect way for us to do Boston."
5269216,71458367,2016-04-25,31217314,Katie,"PROS: great location, clean, updated, perfect space for 5 people."
CONS: AC doesn't go on until May 1 and it was very hot the first night we were there,ceiling fan in master bedroom makes a loud noise intermittently which made it hard to sleep,beds are very uncomfortable,"bath towels were tiny. \"",,
5269216,71824844,2016-04-29,64756499,Jeremy,"The apartment was exactly as advertised. Comfortably fit my family of five.  It's in a, really fun location: close to the T, several good restaurants and a jazz club (Wally's).  I would recommend this apartment.  All in all a good value for a short visit."
Two downsides to the apartment.  First,parking is a bit of a mystery. There doesn't appear to be much on street parking and few garages for overnight parking.  Luckily,the management company had a spot nearby I could rent and I didn't need my car.  Second,the kitchen had very few utensils. There were adequate dishes and silverware,but I couldn't imagine cooking anything more complicated than pasta.  I expected some serving spoons,a spatula
"Thus was also my first experience with AirBNB and after this good experience I would certainly use AirBNB again.\"",,,,,
5269216,73422974,2016-05-08,50925070,Eileen,Excellent accommodation and location for our family of 6 during son's graduation weekend from Northeastern. Close to orange line and a quick ride to anywhere in the city. Right off campus. Great restaurants in the area. No issues with TV or WiFi. Bed in the 3rd bedroom is not a trundle but our 6th person slept on the comfortable couch. Lots of extra linens and pillows available. Plenty of room to spread out and relax. Patio table looked great but we were unable to use it due to cold and rainy weekend. Stairs down to the unit were a bit difficult with a short handrail - only an issue for someone with limited mobility.
5269216,74505098,2016-05-15,51456333,Logan,"The home was VERY clean and the photos represent the home perfectly. The 6 of us enjoyed our 3 night stay very much and will definitely be in touch with Will if we visit Boston again. The area for newbies to Boston was perfect. $20 Lyft ride to DT or to Fenway and that's with a 6 person vehicle. Smaller parties will be less. The unit has a patio outside that is fenced which was perfect for our evening night caps and just a tremendous place. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean as well. We never even turned the TV on but it was at least a 50 Inch flatscreen if that's what you're into. Looked very nice. Overall, I would ABSOLUTELY recommend staying here. A+"
5269216,76621320,2016-05-28,33983567,Constance,"This home worked perfectly for us as a base to celebrate two family events - a wedding and a graduation.  We (the parents) stayed in the master suite at one end and the other two couples each had a bedroom and (shared) bathroom on the other end.  The home was clean, modern, and spacious enough for all of us to hang out comfortably and we even hosted a small dinner party our last night, using the backyard and grill.  We could walk easily to the grocery store, convenience store, coffee shops, and restaurants in the neighborhood.  The kitchen was large in relation to the total space and equipped adequately for meal preparation.  The living area was large enough for all six of us to gather comfortably.  We appreciated the coffee and cleaning supplies as well as the washer and dryer.  Owner communicated promptly and responded quickly to questions and requests for assistance.  Overall, I would recommend this house to families visiting Boston to sightsee or attend a graduation or other family event who want to stay together comfortably."
5269216,81218128,2016-06-21,58650116,Cristina,Our family had a great time at the apartment!  It was a great central location and had nice upgraded amenities.  We would definitely stay here again!
5269216,91464331,2016-08-05,36091580,Christine,Great apartment. We had a great time and the entire process working with Will was seamless.
5269216,93626751,2016-08-13,72907248,Jeana,"\"This apartment is not a good choice for summer.  Although advertised as having A/C, it has only one portable unit in the living room. The bedrooms are on opposite ends of the apartment and you can only choose one direction to blow the air. Closing bedroom doors for privacy is not an option and even leaving the doors open provides little relief because only two of the bedrooms have ceiling fans and they run very slow. No ceiling fans in the living room or kitchen to help distribut the air. It was over 80 degrees in the living room and I can't begin to guess how much hotter it was in the bedrooms. We contacted the owner and were told no other A/C units could be provided because only the one window would accommodate a vent.  We received no response when we suggested the owner supply portable ventless A/C units that do not require windows. We stayed only one night and told the owner we were leaving.  33 hours after we left, the owner sent a message saying if we had called \"\"maintenance\"\" they would have brought more A/C units.  This made no sense as we were never given a number for \"\"maintenance\"\" and were told that no additional A/C units could be provided. If it was that simple"
890705,4176500,2013-04-15,5901008,Joshua,"Nicole was very accommodating and pleasant to be around. I felt very much at home here, very peaceful and quiet. Great place to relax and take it slow for a night. Would definitely stay here again if I were to ever visit the area."
890705,4385428,2013-05-01,5935150,Tomoaki,"Although a map may give you an impression that the place is a bit far from the center of the city, it is not on the level of inconvenience. Once you get used to using the rails, you don't feel inconvenient."
890705,4642533,2013-05-17,5418801,Jacqueline,"This is a great place to base yourself to explore Boston. It might not be the best if you want to experience all of Boston's nightlife as it is quite far to get back to late at night but we had a great stay here. Nicole is lovely, and providing coffee and breakfast stuff for us was a really nice touch."
890705,5073424,2013-06-10,6745413,Paul,"Me and three friends stayed at Nicole's place back in June, and overall it was a good stay."
Pros:,,,,,
- Nicole and her friend Imara were AWESOME hosts; she was always willing to help us if we needed it and went out of her way at times to answer our questions (they were rarely at the house,but always a phone call away). Super friendly people.,,,,
- We were able to get the whole floor to ourselves at an awesome price,especially if you consider all the hotel/motel prices in the Boston and surrounding area. Especially,if you're a college student or working on a tight budget (like we were),this is the place.,,
- Friendly and quiet neighborhood with plenty of street parking and lots of places to eat and do grocery shopping,literally a few minutes walk.,,,,
- Overall,the place was clean and presentable (fresh linens,living area and bedrooms were clean).,,,
Cons:,,,,,
- The kitchen was being renovated at the time we came and so that area was a bit messy.,,,,,
- The washroom wasn't very clean; our group chose to wear sandals/slippers when taking a shower.,,,,,
- They don't give you a spare key to the house,so you need to make arrangements with them when you're coming back home.,,,,
Other comments:,,,,,
- If you don't have a car,the downtown core can be a far commute,as we were told that we would have to transfer three times or so to get to Fenway Park. We had a car,so it wasn't an issue; we were able to get to DT Boston within 15 minutes,even with some moderate traffic.,
- The pictures of the place are professionally done.,,,,,
- OVERALL,I would recommend this place,especially if you're tight on budget. If you're looking for something more fancy or romantic,this may not be suitable for your needs. Again,Nicole was such a warm and friendly host that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at her place.,

890705,5245787,2013-06-20,88112,Ella,I would like to write about my own overall VERY BAD experience.
I reserve a privet independent accommodation from this host for,,,,,
One week and paid about $500,but from06/16 I found myself in a,,,,
Dormitory with 2 additional guests,which host desides accommodate in the same unit without any prior notification and my agreement.I also paid the cleaning fee,but every morning I cleaned by myself the kitchen,bath,toilet.On 06/19 I can't use the kitchen,because the host begings her kitchen's repair
I don't understand how Mrs.Maxey works as a sales associate at her Pondside Realty,but she doesn't know what it is the seller/buyer agreement,the customer privacy and many other basical things. This accommodation is very far from the city center,about 35 or 40 min ( the best case).,,
CONCLUSIONS: I can't recommend this host to anybody,which searches for a comfortable,"safe and trust independent accommodation in Boston.\"",,,
890705,5784513,2013-07-16,6355473,Kamran,"I had an overall good experience at my 2 weeks stay at Nicole's place.They are very family oriented ,nice,helpful and cooperative."
She tries to help in anyway she can .The secret is constant communication with her regarding any concerns and she will do her best to fix it.The transportation is relatively easy and the Shaw's supermarket is very close which will make your life easier.,,,,,
"I will recommend her to my friends.\"",,,,,
890705,5978130,2013-07-24,7579565,Jacqueline,"I have nothing but good things to say about my stay at Nicole’s. First of all, my trip to Boston was very last minute and I needed a place to stay urgently. I messaged a few hosts and hours later I still had not heard anything back. I messaged Nicole and without an hour she got back to me and I was booked. Nicole’s place was nice, clean, quiet and safe. I had the whole floor to myself while I was there. The neighborhood itself is nice; there is public transportation close by and a grocery store. As a host Nicole was great.  She left some breakfast for me in the fridge, some snacks and there was coffee available. She was also helpful about the questions I had and was always a phone call away. I will definitely recommend staying here if you are in the Boston area and need a place to stay."
890705,7450686,2013-09-20,8828561,Andreas,Nicole was a very kind host. It was nice talking to her and she was very helpful if there were some questions from my side.
The room was cute and comfortable. The bathroom was clean.,,,,,
I had a very long trip and arrived at 11 in the evening. But Nicole was awake and waited to welcome me. Much appreciated.,,,,,

890705,7910463,2013-10-07,8924550,Jonathan,The home was beautiful and clean. You couldn't ask for a friendlier or more quiet neighborhood. Nicole was an extremely attentive hostess...and Nemo (her dog) was especially charming.
890705,8036462,2013-10-13,632799,Zoey,"Nicole was so accommodating as we booked a last minute stay (only a 4 hour notice) with her in Boston. She was warm and welcoming. She even went out and bought us new sheets! Her house is sweet and spacious. A great dinner recommendation by Nicole was so close to her home (within walking distance)- Steel and Rye- so good and delicious! We were there for a quick stay, but it was a cute little borough to explore had we had more time."
890705,8240184,2013-10-21,9423985,Mathias,"I had a wonderful stay in her apartment. The rooms were very nice, the lounge and kitchen were comfortable and everything was excellently cleaned. There is also a really nice garden area with chairs and table out the back."
The apartment is in a peaceful residential area with a big supermarket and bars/restaurants/ hair dresser/ right around the corner. I chose to walk the 20 mins to the Ashmont T,but it would also be possible to take the bus or Mattapan High Way Line to Ashmont T.,,,,
Everything was ready for me when I arrived and Nicole was open for all my questions and was open for additional requests,too.,,,,

890705,8301051,2013-10-24,9310213,Jericho,Stayed only one short night but it was a nice house in a quiet neighborhood with restaurants nearby. Nicole is friendly and accommodating. Would stay again.
890705,8456779,2013-10-31,9648516,Isabelle,"As for my first Airbnb reservation, Nicole left a positive impression on my continuous use of the site. She was super nice and accommodating as my family and I (of 8) booked the place of couple of days; and since we booked last minute as we weren't sure whether our tickets were ready, she was able to arrange for someone to welcome us into the place and get us settled in within an hour since she wasn't available - but Nicole and her mom later came to welcome us - my Mom and Dad say hi!"
Everything was professionally handled timely and when we had to stay an extra day,it was easily transacted (without hassle). The apartment was as beautiful as the pictures,clean,and well organized. There was breakfast available,tv,full kitchen

It was my first time and her first time as an adult and we were sure to make the best of it. It is a very walkable city with plenty to do and see.

13613562,89893873,2016-07-30,53900232,Jessica,"Alan and his associate were very good at communicating before and during our stay. We did a self-check in but it was simple and Alan and his associate did their best to ensure we had everything we needed. The location is amazing, just a short walk from great restaurants and the harbor. The view was also amazing. Our only complaint was the condition of the carpet in the apartment. It had many large stains all over it."
13613562,92258594,2016-08-08,57817267,Nichola,"I went to Boston for my sisters bachlorette and spend almost 600 on a two night stay on Webster Street in East London at one of Alan's apartments. While the location was very convenient and the neighborhood very cute, the apartment itself was very lacking. The entrance way was not clean, and was very dark and old and musty. The entire stairwell and apartment smelled of musty cigarettes. The apartment looked as though it hadn't been cleaned, the carpets were dirty and stained, and had not been vacuumed well, if at all. The floor looked as though it hadn't been swept either. The toilet was dirty. There was barely any soap throughout the entire apartment. Also, there was one tiny AC unit for the apartment, which barely worked. It was so hot I had a very hard time sleeping the whole weekend, and I am usually a sound sleeper. I would not recommend this Air Bnb for the money spent."

Easy to walk everywhere, Green Line is out the front steps and shopping/eating on Newbury is just around the corner!"

Marlo was wonderful to work with and very responsive to any inquiries. The building super,David,was also extremely helpful.,,,
The apartment is very comfortable and is in perhaps the most convenient location for anyone visiting the city. That said,being located right off Newbury Street and next to a restaurant,it can be a little loud at times. This is the perfect location for individuals looking to enjoy all of activity of this part of town,but perhaps not the best location for those looking for a very quiet night in.,,

Kitchen is well equipped, bedroom is clean with good bed and quality linens. Bathroom could be better - everything is dated, bathtub doesn't drain too well, no hairdryer."
"Make sure you discuss with the host all your extra needs in details ahead of time to avoid any last minute confusions. Looks like there is no flexibility once you are in the apartment.\"",,,,,

5903001,75595106,2016-05-22,67265924,Josh,"Overall, the apartment is nice. It’s in an old building so there’s going to be some imperfections. The location is great with the walking distance to most everything being ideal. My one note for those looking at this possible rental is that for those who are light sleepers this place won’t be your sleep nirvana. There’s a bar directly below the apartment that closes at 2am and the crowd behavior at that time is to be expected. During our stay, there were a few fights and screaming matches that were exacerbated by the world’s angriest liquor, tequila. If you plan on being out until 2 am, you will be fine."
1136972,5029648,2013-06-08,6689409,Diana,"This room was exactly what I was looking for!  Brian and Lisa were very accommodating during my stay.  I drove into Boston and there was parking right in front of their apartment, even at 11:00 in the evening.  Brian and Lisa were still up and happy to welcome me into their home.  The room was a fine size with a T.V. and a ton of books on exploring Boston.  There were snacks and the breakfast was more than I could ask for!  Cereal, bagels, fruit, oatmeal, you name it.  The bed was large and comfy, and the entire apartment was extremely clean!  The location of the apartment was steps from a bus stop which takes you to the last T stop on the Orange line.  To the T stop, it's about a 10 minute walk, all on the sidewalk, and you only have to cross a street or two.  The orange line takes you into the city pretty quickly, so this is a really great location for the price (especially considering the awesome unlimited T pass!!).  If you're a runner like me, the Arnold Arboretum is super close, and you can run all through those paths and around the Jamaica Ponds for a really great jogging loop.  I definitely recommend this room to stay in.  Just remember this is a little bit outside of the more student-filled parts of the city, so utilize those buses if you are alone at night!"
1136972,5109401,2013-06-12,6788591,Laura,"Lisa and Brian were my first airbnb hosts, and we had such a great experience. The room is clean and beautiful,l and they've anticipated every need. They are so hospitable and made us feel welcome. The room was close to the T stop, and I purchased a Link pass, so accessing all parts of Boston was very simple. Its a great deal, and you're in for a treat."
1136972,5123695,2013-06-13,1794857,Carolina,I cannot rave enough about what a wonderful stay my boyfriend and I had at Lisa and Brian's place. Their home is an ideal place to stay with public transportation right outside their doors and a clean comfortable house to relax in at the end of the day. The many fantastic amenities they provide for their guests just goes to show you how they pay attention to details and care about the quality of service they provide. Brian and Lisa were also helpful and easy to communicate with. I would highly recommend their place. Thank you Brian and Lisa!
1136972,5168686,2013-06-16,6740646,Febriyani (Rochel),"3 letters: BED! Yes, the bed was so so comfy, I slept like a baby, which was great, because of the 6 hours difference in timezone. Complimented with smooth fresh sheets and towels, with a cute chocolate candy on top, to make you feel welcome!. The room was fantastically decorated, with wooden furniture, stacks of guide books and maps of Boston, with flyers of take-away, feels really like home. Breakfast was delicious, local Boston selections, coupled with Lisa homemade cookies. Lisa and Brian was such great company, we talked about lots of things, and watch series together through the home cinema projector! And the unlimited card made it feel so close to downtown! Great place!"
1136972,5236176,2013-06-19,2326946,Emily,"Lisa was an absolute joy as a host, very friendly and accommodating! The apt is in a great location in Roslindale, close to public transit, Jamaica Plains, food, shopping, etc. The bed was amazing, and the room was extremely cozy and you could tell a lot of thought and detail went into everything that was provided for their airbnb guests. I have only two complaints (I hate to mention them since Lisa has no control over it) but the upstairs neighbors were pretty loud, I had to wear ear plugs to sleep. The other is that I had bad cell reception (AT&T) and could not make any calls there. Everything else was great, thanks again!"
1136972,5440070,2013-06-30,6740646,Febriyani (Rochel),"Came back for the 2nd time! Yes, it's that great! It was just as I remember it to be, and perhaps even better. It was 5 star room decorated with such care for the guest. Lisa and Brian was not only a host, but also became a friend! They took me out 1 night, even with their busy schedule, to a delicious indian restaurant. If you are looking for a place in Boston where they serve typical Bostonian breakfast, comfortable and family welcoming host, this is definitely the place"

We loved the location, it is really super close to the city and so easy to get around, and Lisa even made fresh banana bread for us - which was amazing! We highly recommend it (which we already do) and had a wonderful time - thanks again"
1136972,5873998,2013-07-20,614568,Chris,Lisa was super helpful throughout our stay. She made us delicious chocolate banana bread in the morning -- and had a lot of breakfast items for us to choose from. This is a great place to stay if you're visiting Boston!
1136972,5893673,2013-07-21,7275697,Thomas,"My first impression of Lisa and Brian were nothing short of a wow. They were a very friendly and detail oriented host which made our stay very relaxing and comfortable. The room was as described and very clean! Another amazing thing is the Charlie Cards and a local market (Harvest) farmer's membership card provided for our convenience! A huge plus!! Lastly Lisa's banana cakes were A...MaZe...ZING! Will definitely stay with Lisa and Brian if given the opportunity. Great rate, great people, great city."

1136972,6027299,2013-07-27,6942617,Marlon,"We really enjoyed staying at Lisa and Brian's place. They make it very cosy for their guests. The room has some books that can give you great information on Boston, and they are also very helpful in suggesting restaurants or points of interest. The Bed was fantastic! Slept like a baby. The free public transportation passes are a huge plus. The other thing I really liked was the breakfast in the morning. Lisa is interested in starting a B&B in the future, and based on our stay, I'm sure it will be a success. Will come here for another stay in Boston."
1136972,6052384,2013-07-28,2781758,Erika,"I only got to meet Lisa for a short moment, but she was very nice and even offered some yummy homemade breakfast to take away! Her home is lovely and the room I stayed in was clean and exactly what I needed. I felt very safe and at ease at their place, and even when they weren't home you could sense their hospitality."
1136972,6095757,2013-07-29,5471928,Hildur,I only stayed one night at Lisa's but she was an excellent host and I felt very comfortable. It was fun to talk to her and easy to be private too. She also helped me buying my bussticket which I was very grateful for. I wouldnt hesitate to stay with them again!
1136972,6584472,2013-08-18,6608940,Elizabeth,"Lisa and Brian were really nice hosts! They were very friendly and helpful, and made us feel very comfortable. We came for a relatively long stay - 3 weeks - and we have no regrets. We really enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and comfortable, we had clean towels and sheets, a nice desk and TV. Sharing the bathroom was not a problem, everything went smooth. The breakfast was more than we could eat! And the apartment was cozzy and nicely decorated. There are bus stops just outside the house to either direction, and the subway is just one bus stop away. The subway/bus cards were really helpful, save us time and lots of money."
For those who are very sensitive with noise,the apartment is on the ground floor,and sometimes of the day you can hear people walking on the floor above.,,,
Lisa and Brian are good people,and we wish them the best luck with their new life in Boston. We highly recommend their room,"and would definitely stay again.\"",,,
1136972,6638252,2013-08-19,8005655,Rinat,"Lisa and Brian were very nice, the place is comftrable, clean and we sleep so good! great breakfast! thank you :)"

They are so kind and gentle, it was my first Airbnb experience and let me tell you it was great, and I would definitely return to their place if I need a place in the city.

There is a beautiful public park around,which is nice to go for a walk. Also in a  neighborhood, you can find supermarket, pizza, bars very easily."
The bed is quiet comfortable,and really clean. Lisa provides almost everything,towels,shower gel,snacks,breakfast and even movies ( you can watch the movie with projectors via Netflix!!!They also give advise on movies :P )Oh!!! and they have an awesome Popcorn machine

1136972,6982690,2013-09-02,6746459,Limay,"Lisa and her husband were amazing hosts! Right when I got to her apartment, Lisa made her chocolate chip cookies that I STILL miss today! Lisa and her husband were extremely helpful teaching me how to use the bus and T! The room was homey and bed was heavenly. I would recommend college students or anyone who needs a place to stay their apartment. It was like a home away from home."
1136972,7137764,2013-09-08,2379119,Jimmy,This room is great close to subway and convenient for quick access to Boston.  Lisa and Brian were great hosts and the space  definitely met and exceeded our expectation.  Breakfast was perfect and just as we had requested since we had special dietary requests.  The subway tickets were great and we used them everyday.  Very pleased with our stay in Boston!
1136972,7217540,2013-09-11,6275249,Verena,My husband and I stayed with Lisa and Brain for 3 nights and we enjoyed our stay very much. Their cozy apartment is located great in a nice and safe neighborhood only a couple of minutes from the T (the subway what takes about 15-20 minutes downtown). Free T tickets for the whole stay were even included what is really great. Boston is the nicest city ever and definitely a visit worth it – there is so much to do!
Lisa and Brain are great hosts who are very friendly and nice. It was always fun talking to them. They supported us very much and gave us directions and advices to the city’s hotspots. We definitely think they should run their own Bed and Breakfast because they were always well prepared. In our room were many maps and information about Boston. Moreover,Lisa wrote an introduction about their apartment and thinks to know,what is very helpful when you are foreign. Their kitchen is not open for cooking what is totally fine because they provided us with everything we needed. We had our own fridge,microwave,coffee maker and utensils. Free breakfast including bagels,English muffins
Our room was very nice,clean and comfortable – we slept very well!,,,,
We highly recommend Lisa and Brain – they are a nice couple and awesome hosts! Thank you guys! We had a great time!,,,,,

La maison est bien située, proche du metro et vous pouvez laisser votre voiture dans la rue sans problèmes, c'est gratuit. Le lit est assez confortable mais par contre la chambre est proche de la route. Le petit déjeuner est très bien aussi : bagel, céréales, gruau, jus d'orange,..."

Everything was perfect,from chocolate on top of the fresh towels,to  a very clean and super nice room with fresh sheets and a q&a page with all the information you need - from Wifi password and how to check out.,,,
Great great great!,Lisa was super nice,"and the location is perfect if you need to park - parking is free and you can drive to down-town Boston in just 15 minutes. I did not use the subway but I know it's very close.\"",,,
1136972,7547908,2013-09-24,6995068,Lucy,Thanks to Lisa and Brian for their hospitality and  wonderful accommodations while my sister and I were in Boston for 3 nights. The room was clean and linens were fresh. Breakfast and two unlimited Charlie tickets for bus and subway I thought were a plus not to mention the station is very close to their place. It really made our trip easy and convenient. I would recommend Boston Room with Lisa and Brian if you are planning to stay in Boston.
1136972,7668192,2013-09-29,7804466,Colin,Excellent room. Friendly hosts. Variety of food available for breakfast. Easy access to downtown using the free transit pass. Highly recommended.

1136972,7808313,2013-10-04,7448291,Nathalie,"All features and bonuses were as described (Please note that the breakfast corner is in the dining room). The room was very clean, all other rooms were clean. Lisa was very friendly and good to communicate with. Brian seemed to be a little shy and/or uncommunicative."
It was great to have the free passes for subway/bus (the bus-stop is right in front of the house). We had no problems to come home savely in the evening,but as non-Bostonians we did not feel really comfortable in the neighborhood.,,,,
All in all a really good price/performance ratio!,,,,,

déjeuner continental avec dégustation de gâteau fait maison.,,,,,
Grand lit confortable et partage sans problème de la salle de bain.,,,,,
Lisa met à disposition un pass de transport,ce qui facilite la vie et rend plus économique le séjour chez elle.Ce qui est un avantage indéniable quant on prend souvent les transports en commun. Lisa a su nous témoigner une grande attention et beaucoup de gentillesse pendant tout notre séjour. Nous la remercions encore bien fort aujourd'hui. Nous devons toutefois préciser que,,,,
ce logement est plutôt conseillé  aux gens qui se lèvent tôt,,,,,
"à causes des bruits matinaux en semaine.\"",,,,,

1136972,7981303,2013-10-11,982665,Bart,"We stayed for one night at Lisa's and Brian's place. The room is as depicted. Our hosts were well organized, easy-going, communicative and quiet. Being able to use the unlimited subway passes was a big plus. I'd recommend their place to anyone visiting Boston."
1136972,8021874,2013-10-13,7278999,Benjamin & Camille,"Nous sommes arrivés à Boston par avion et il nous a fallut environ 40 minutes en transports en commun pour rejoindre le domicile de Lisa. L'accès est relativement facile, d'autant plus que Lisa fournit des explications précises."
La chambre était conforme a ce qui était annoncé,un grand lit confortable et un accès indépendant appréciable. L'accueil était particulièrement soigné (bouteilles d'eau,jus d’orange,snacks,mini-frigo indépendant,pass transport en commun illimité etc...) et Lisa et Brian ont été très disponibles.
Cela a été une très bonne expérience,"à recommander sans hésiter!\"",,,,
1136972,8112147,2013-10-16,8107212,Debbee,"We enjoyed this vacation.  We arrived by bus into Boston and hopped on the subway system to get to Lisa's house.  It was supper easy.  Lisa was there are greeted us.  The room was nice and clean.  She left us some snacks (bottles of water, cookies ect).  We had 2 sets of keys and 2 unlimited subway/bus passes.  That was a great bonus and saved us tons of money.  Breakfast was included (cereal, english muffins, OJ, coffee, teas, instant oatmeal).  This was def worth the price.  Great hosts and easy access makes this room a steal."
1136972,8191291,2013-10-20,8429161,Ofke,"This was our first air bnb experience and it was great!! We arrived a little bit early, however Lisa didn't mind at all and made us feel at home straight away. The room was spacious and clean, with a very large comfortable bed. The very big plus was the breakfast provided each morning; cereal, oatmeal, fresh milk and juice etc. They have a little corner in the livingroom with a microwave, toaster and fridge all for your own private use, which makes the stay even more comfortable. Lisa and Brian are great hosts, however they also respect your privacy."
The appartment is not directly in the city centre,however the subway is only a 7 minute walk and the busstop is right across the street.,,,,
"I would definately recommend this place if yur looking for very good value for money just outside the city centre!!\"",,,,,
1136972,8320944,2013-10-25,9258897,Cheuk Hin,"This is my first ever Airbnb experience, and it was great. The house is near the last stop of the T, and just around 15 to 20 minutes you can go around the tourist attractions of Boston. The room was good, and the complimentary mini bar and subway pass were super nice. Lisa is a very friendly host, who would also suggest where to travel around Boston if you needed."

I liked how there was a door leading straight into the bedroom!  There was always food out on the little food table, and lots of cereal.  The location was good. We really loved the free subway cards that were provided. That saved us a lot of time and money. The subway station was only about a 10 minute walk from their place..

Everything else about the space is just as advertised - easy access to bus and subway, warm, comfortable bed, etc. I'd stay again."
A note for guests visiting in the cooler months - pack slippers,as,like many New England homes,"the floors can be quite chilly.\"",,

The subway ride downtown was around 15 minutes or so. The subway pass was greatly appreciated, and so was the availability of Netflixs and the big screen. Also, there was breakfast (which I have discovered is not necessarily something you can expect with some of these airbnb places, despite what the name implies.) When I found the place a bit cool they obligingly turned up the heat. There's a market nearby with organic and better quality food. All in all, a good place to stay in Boston."

Buses literally stop directly across the street quite frequently.  Lisa also provides her guests with UNLIMITED T/Bus passes (2). The room was clean and quite comfortable. Bathroom is shared by guests and host.  There is a limited supply of hot water so you need to be conscientious.  Hair dryer was supplied which was nice!
The only negative thing I would have to say is that there are some very noisy neighbors upstairs.  So if you are a light sleeper this is not the place for you.,,,,,
Definitely served our purpose for staying here...we saved a TON of money on our accommodations and therefore we could spend it doing fun things in Boston!!,,,,,
Would recommend Lisa's place.,,,,,

1136972,13373802,2014-05-26,15213959,Nicole,"We had a wonderful time staying at Lisa and Brian's place. They were very accommodating (we needed to arrive a little early to drop off our things before heading to a festival downtown) and very helpful with directions for getting to the nearby subway stop. The unlimited subway/bus passes provided were a great bonus. Everything was exactly as described, the bed and sheets were absolutely so comfortable and the wifi was fast.  A really great first Airbnb experience!"
1136972,13600533,2014-06-01,12337005,Bryan,"This was our first AirBnB experience and it was a great one! Lisa and Brian were excellent hosts, very welcoming and accommodating. The place was exactly as described in the listing. The bed was super comfortable, the shower was nice, the breakfast nook was continually stocked with stuff for us to eat for breakfast/snacks. The movie room with popcorn machine was a fun way to wind down from a long day of exploring Boston as well. The NFT (Not For Tourists) books in the bedroom were a great way to find things to do and places to eat at around Boston, but Lisa also has many good recommendations as well. She provided lots of information about the city and places to see/eat. The selling point for us was the unlimited public transportation passes and we found it extremely convenient to have! Didn't have to rent a car, and didn't have to keep putting money on a pass to get around and hope we had enough value left on it. If I came back to Boston, I'd highly consider staying here again."
1136972,13798412,2014-06-04,15615557,Gaelle,1st experience with Airnb and we LOVED it! Lisa and her husband were very helpful. Very clean and calm room with everything provided EVEN the breakfast each morning.
Due to the location of the place ( 5 minutes away from the subway station in bus),we were given a free subway-bus pass which helped us save many dollars for our various trips in Boston.,,,,
we recommend it and would definitely go back there for any future trip to Boston.,,,,,

1136972,13932104,2014-06-08,178912,Nicole & Jaime,"We had a short but lovely stay with Lisa and Brian, and we would definitely return. Getting into and out of the apartment was a breeze, parking and transportation were easy, local stores are very close, the accommodations were comfortable and quiet, and Lisa and Brian were extremely helpful and communicative."
It's a shared,lived in space,but we didn't really feel that our stay was an imposition -- not always the case even when you have a private room somewhere.,,,
It's always fun and quirky when life hands you people with oddly familiar backgrounds......like Lisa's and Brian's sci-fi posters that we also have,and their robot wedding cake toppers that we also had (robots of a different kind,but still),and the added bonus surprise of realizing they're also alumni of a small university aaaalllllll the way across the country -- ah,"the joys of random and seemingly improbable coincidences. \"",
1136972,14144088,2014-06-13,11623091,Blandine Et Quentin,"The stay at Lisa and Brian was amazing !!! The room was really nice, everything as described. The must was the smell of fresh cookies, muffins... that Lisa prepared (and they were delicious !!). The couple was really nice, open and told us a lot of different fact on the town. Really nice experience and if we have to come back in Boston we will definitely go to stay with them again !! Thank you again Lisa and Brian !"

The breakfast was also very good especially the homemade cookies that Lisa prepared us, yummy. The Charlie cards ( for bus and subway) were very useful and within 20mn, we were in city center. We loved this place so much, that we decided to come back for an additional night."

The train is just 10 min walking which is really convenient. The breakfast they offer is perfect! There is everything cereals, muffin, bagel, fresh fruit. If I come back to Boston I would definitely stay with them again!!"

1136972,14911030,2014-06-29,11414475,Oluwatimilehin (Timi),Lisa was very accommodating. I realized she went out of her way to provided a cot for my niece to sleep. The location is great and the free passes came in very handy. She also had a well stocked breakfast nook. I would stay here again.
1136972,15518217,2014-07-10,17682152,Paul And Zoe,"My girlfriend Zoe and I stayed with Lisa and Brian for 3 nights and had a fantastic first experience using airbnb! Lisa was so helpful and gave us loads of info about what to do in and around Boston. When we arrived she also gave us two Charlie cards for the underground meaning that we could travel to most places free using the subway! We were also given our own wee dining area, with plenty of food provided for breakfast and snacks! Lisa also bakes cookies which kept magically disappearing and reappearing ;) We both felt really comfortable, were made to feel at home and even took advantage of the living room space using the giant projector and popcorn machine :) We would definitely stay here again and would 100% recommend Lisa and Brian for their kind hospitality! Thanks!"
1136972,15755043,2014-07-15,13159434,Nick,"This was my first experience with airbnb.  I was motivated to try it once I found out how expensive hotels were in Boston.  Thankfully, it was a good choice.  Lisa is a warm host with a knack for hospitality.  There is a nice private room with a comfy bed, tv and private entrance.  It got hot in Boston while we were there, but our room stayed nice and cool with an air-conditioner.  You are sharing space, including a bathroom, but we never felt like we were in the way or intruding on our hosts.  We enjoyed the transit cards that were provided as well as the snacks and breakfast items.  It's not a 4 star hotel downtown, but it is a good  value with nice hosts.  Overall, everything matched the description on airbnb."
1136972,16094309,2014-07-22,3400887,Rachel,It was a pleasure staying with Lisa and Brian for the few days we spent in Boston. The location is great and right on the T line. We literally just walked across the street and jumped on the bus. Lisa and Brian were actually recommended to us by a co-worker so our expectations were already high. But they still exceeded them! The bed is SUPER comfortable which was really important after a long flight or day walking around the city. Lisa and Brian both were full of advice on where to go and what to see. Thank you guys! We had a blast!
1136972,16291319,2014-07-25,6345632,Maaike & Jeroen,We had a nice time in Boston. The breakfast was good and the free passes for the subway a nice extra.

1136972,16607986,2014-07-30,14995741,Monika,"Der erste Eindruck unseres Quartiers war eher enttäuschend, da die Gegend Roslindale nicht das ist, was man sich unter Boston vorstellt. Die Wohnung aber war völlig in Ordnung. Das Zimmer war sauber und genau so wie beschrieben. Das Bett war wirklich sehr bequem, wir haben sehr gut geschlafen. WIFI hat super gut und schnell funktioniert. Das Bad war auch sehr sauber, wir hatten immer warmes Wasser. Die Frühstücksecke im Wohnzimmer war gut ausgestattet mit zwei verschiedenen Kaffeemaschinen, Wasserkocher, Toaster. Es gab jeden Tag Rolls, wir konnten uns Kaffee machen, so viel wir wollten. es gab Butter, Milch, Orangensaft, Cornflakes, Obst, Riegel, ... und was uns besonders gut gefallen hat, es gab richtig schönes Geschirr für das Frühstück. Wir konnten uns den Tisch gepflegt decken. Also das Frühstück war für Amerikanische Verhältnisse wirklich sehr gut. Ein Vergleich mit Österreich oder Deutschland erübrigt sich, wenn man andere Quartiere in Amerika kennen lernt, in denen Frühstück ein Fremdwort ist."
Lisa war immer sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend zu uns. Sie hat uns angeboten,Filme mit dem Heimkino zu schauen,was wir aber dann,wengen unserer eher fehlenden Englishkenntnisse nicht gemacht haben. Lisa hat uns mit selbstgebackenen Cookies verwöhnt. Sie macht ihre Arbeit als B&B-Gastgeberin wirklich gut.,,
Was auch sehr gut war,aber auf Grund der Lage des Quartiers auch sehr notwendig,waren die Charly-Cards,die uns ermöglichten ganz Boston kostenlos mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln,Bus und U-Bahn zu erreichen. Das hat uns einiges an Geld erspart,da eine einzelne Fahrt jeweil über 2$ pro Person kostet. Mit der Charly-Card konnten wir aus- und einsteigen so oft wir wollten
Es gibt eine Bushaltestelle direkt vor dem Haus. Wir sind mit dem Bus zur U-Bahn-Station gefahren. Leider haben wir nciht herausgefunden,wie wir mit dem Bus zurückkommen,daher gingen wir den Rückweg von der U-Bahn immer zu Fuß - das sind etwa 10 min. Auf dem Weg kamen wir dann immer an einem Supermarkt vorbei,bei dem wir immer noch eine Kleinigkeit eingekauft haben. Wir waren zu zweit. Alleine möchte ich als Frau den Weg von der U-Bahn zum Quartier aber nicht gehen,dazu erscheint mir die Gegend doch etwas zu unsicher.,
Mit dem Auto ist das Quartier sowieso perfekt - weil es Preis-Leistungmäßig für Boston nicht zu schlagen ist.,,,,,
Für Lisa und ihr Quartier also die Beurteilung: Sehr gut,,,,,
"Für die Gegend eher ein Durchschnittlich\"",,,,,
1136972,16696668,2014-07-31,17704769,Maha,"The place was great, the breakfast delightful, altough we didn't get to enjoy the compagny of our hosts due to our short stay. I would highly recommand this place for people visiting Boston as it is close to the metro station. The free passe was also a big plus. Thank you very much Lisa and Bryan !"
1136972,16777246,2014-08-02,16742840,Meredith,"My husband and I had such a nice stay with Brian and Lisa. Lisa was so friendly and accommodating and went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable: chatting with us, making restaurant recommendations, restocking juice and muffins at night ... She even helped us set up their projector and make popcorn, gave us a couple short rides, AND mailed the items we left behind. We would definitely stay with her again!"
1136972,17148306,2014-08-08,8835234,Josefina,"Lisa and Brian were the best hosts we've had with AirBNB so far. We had the greatest experience we could've imagined there. They were very friendly and nice to us, all we needed was covered. We received a lot of good recomendations and also had some great conversations with them. The room was perfect as the apartment. Breakfast was great too, Lisa bakes the best cookies we've ever had :). We also used Netflix in their home cinema, truly a good experience."
The house is right in front of the bus stop that takes you to the subway,great connections,and the free passes made the trip much easier. We had no trouble at all with the neighbourhood,it was really quiet.,,
If we ever repeat this trip,"we'll repeat the hosts. 100% recomended.\"",,,,
1136972,17401035,2014-08-11,19074530,Soren,"Everything was great about this place--Lisa was helpful and awake when my plane was late and I got in at 2 am, bed and breakfast were as advertised (and the breakfast was extra good--muffins, bagels, cereal, toast, fruit, juices, etc.), and generally, it felt like a home away from home. Thank you so much!"
1136972,17542543,2014-08-13,19648114,Megan,"Lisa was a great host. She lives in a nice area of Boston and the listing of the apartment is very accurate. Not only did we get free passes for the subway, but she also recommended lots of things to do in Boston during our stay."

It's not a nice room, it's not a confy bed&generous tastybreakfast, it's much more than that. They make you feel like home, which is really appreciated when you are abroad or visiting different cities. Hope to have the chance to give them the same accomodating, confort and welcoming someday when they come to Spain."

We would stay here again and think you should too!
1136972,19277842,2014-09-09,2831015,Hal,"I stayed with Lisa for three nights while attending a conference in downtown Boston. The room was very much as advertised, and I was very pleased that I had chosen to stay there. I was out most of the day, and Lisa provided everything I needed--a clean, quiet room, a comfortable bed, and access to food and drink goodies when I wanted them."
Her house is a short walk or quick bus ride from the subway,which gets you downtown in less than 20 minutes. Lisa makes the trip simpler and cheaper by providing  her guests with a free pass to the public transportation system. I appreciated that.,,,,
Lisa's place is a fairly short walk from the Jamaica Plain section of the Boston area,which is becoming a popular spot. I spent part of one day in a pleasant walk through the nearby arboretum and had a enjoyable lunch at a JP restaurant.,,,,
Lisa is a gracious host. Though we didn't get too much time to talk,she was very welcoming and made me feel at home. I recommend that anyone looking to stay in Boston give her place serious consideration.,,,,

The subway passes are a big plus too.  Just be sure to bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper like I am (our room faced a somewhat busy road - not loud though with the earplugs in)."

I felt they acted just like I would if I had good friends from out of town in my home. The bed was SO comfortable and the sheets wete super soft! The room was made up just like we were in a hotel, with snacks and a list of what to do and see. If we're back in Boston, this is where we will stay! One, cause I'd like to see them again, and two, because it was so conveniently located! The neighborhood bar was a blast!! Alsi, they provided us with free unlimited T passes which saved us like 40 bucks!"

They were super flexible about our arrival time, especially since we didn't know when the lunch we were going to before heading to them would be over.  The bed in the room was comfy and amazing- I am not a napper and I immediately fell asleep while reading guiding books after getting situated.  We ended up going to dinner with them later and had a great time talking about tv, games, and other nerdtastic stuff."
The house was a super easy and safe 10-12 minute walk (we timed it) to the Forest Hill Station.  We even walked home at 11:30pm after a Red Sox game and felt absolutely safe.  Breakfast was great,Lisa even had coffee with us for a few mornings AND got up early the day we left to say good bye.,,,,
They made a great info sheet about the room and the house,so we knew where everything was. There were cookies,water,and other snacks in our room waiting for us to arrive- it was a fantastic experience.,,

Lisa's artistic skills are apparent. The room, especially the bed, was very comfortable with a desk, TV, and other necessities. Having to share a bathroom did not present a problem. The provided transportation passes were extremely helpful and an inspired idea. Coffee, bagels, muffins, fruit, etc. were always fresh and available."

We both felt safe the for the entire stay. (But we live in a very violent city so anything is safe compared to home haha) but with that aside we were just fine walking around after dark and had no issues.
The experience was exactly what it showed on the listing!,,,,,

1136972,20698719,2014-10-04,1593030,Michelle,"Lisa's place was wonderful. Charming, cozy and easily accessed by public transportation. Wonderful to have breakfast foods available to start the day and upon arrival cookies and chocolates. The biggest benefit to visitors is the Charlie card transit passes she provides her quests. This is invaluable for visiting the city. My husband and I got a City pass for 5 days and with the Charlie card transit passes pretty much did everything on those cards because we had unlimited access to transportation. Even things we weren't sure would be of interest to us we decided to explore because the Charlie card allowed us to get there for free and the city pass included the attraction. Well done Lisa. Excellent benefit and perk! Highly recommend her home, she is warm, personable and very accommodating!"

Lisa let us borrow her umbrella in case it rained (and it did) so she saved us either from getting really wet or buying an umbrella for just one day!,,,,,

They are also very knowledgeable about Boston attractions and the transit system.  We texted several times with questions and always got a quick, helpful answer.  The included bus and subway passes are an awesome amenity with the room. The bus stops right by the house in both directions. The room was clean and organized.  Bed was very comfortable. Enjoyed the self serve breakfast area...lots of choices, and it's available all day. We had a great visit with Lisa and Brian before we headed to the airport, lots of laughs.

It's an easy walk to the Orange Line with a nice natural grocery store along the way. There is a generous amount of common space and breakfast was included. I felt very comfortable here."

While the place is nice, it's the all the extra touches Lisa adds that make it really great. Fresh baked cookies, snacks, breakfast, guidebooks, an umbrella, a subway pass, bottled water... honestly, just about everything you could even think of needed. Lisa was also easy to communicate with and was very flexible with my very late arrival time. I would definitely recommend Lisa's place."

The location is more convenience that it seems on map. The bus stop is right across the street. The train station is 10-15 mins walking distance. There is a beautiful park close to the apartment, very nice for jogging. I had several pleasant chit-chat with the hostess."
1136972,22299552,2014-11-03,21175790,Jonathan,"From the moment we got there, Lisa was a very gracious host. The room is exactly how it looks in the picture, even with a few improvements to help with the upcoming winter months. Forest Hills is a quaint neighborhood where there is no shortage of buses to get to the T. (But why not just walk when you can squeeze in some more steps). While you are sharing common space and a bathroom with others, I rarely saw them. The space is clean, private, affordable, secure and quiet in the evenings which was perfect."
There was a moment where our CharlieCard stopped working,"but Lisa quickly reimbursed us for our troubles. She keeps the kitchen stocked with breakfast and answers quickly if you have any questions.  \"",,,,
1136972,22777963,2014-11-14,22824624,Simone,"Our 4 night stay with Lisa and Brian was fantastic! The place was exactly as described and Lisa made us feel so welcome from even before we arrived by providing us with a list of suggestions of what to do in Boston, as well as very good instructions on how to get to their place. Lisa has thought of just about everything that travellers may need and has gone to extra lengths to make sure everything is provided. We loved being able to make our own food and felt very at home in their place. We enjoyed going for runs and walks in the neighbouring Arboretum and Emerald Necklace, and it was absolutely stunning in Boston with all of the autumn leaves. We found the use of the subway cards very useful and it was so easy to catch busses and trains from their house. I would recommend their place to anyone going to Boston. My only fear now is that other airbnb places will not live up the high standard set by Lisa and Brian. Thank you so much to them both for having us - I wish we could have stayed longer."
1136972,22843142,2014-11-16,7310231,Brittany,"Lisa and Brian were great, gracious hosts. Their large home is a bona fide B&B, complete with chocolates on the pillows, continental breakfast, a movie projector, plenty of guidebooks, and other friendly guests. My husband and I stayed in the Boston Room. Very cozy. Although a bit far from downtown Boston, the unlimited Charlie cards (public transportation) made it easy to get around. Roslindale is also a cute little area with fun shops and decent restaurants."

Lisa made sure we had everything we needed…fresh towels, breakfast provided, tea and coffee, even “Charlie cards” that we could use for free on the Boston public transport. It was a very easy transaction as Lisa is very professional and friendly…communication was clear, quick and accurate throughout the booking process. The apartment was quite big (spread over 2 floors) so there was room enough to be by ourselves or interact with other guests if we wanted. Overall, a very positive airbnb experience and we would recommend to everyone."
1136972,23184169,2014-11-24,22307995,Shyam,"Lisa was great from beginning to end.  She was understanding of a late arrival and early departure, and made us feel at home during my 4 night stay. The breakfast was a great bonus, and having the unlimited Charlie Cards made traveling so much easier. The room was just as pictured. The bed was cozy, and the additional heating blanket was definitely a plus. Having a shared bathroom didn't affect the quality of the stay at all. If I'm ever in Boston again, I'll definitely be staying here."
1136972,23264441,2014-11-27,20459493,Benjamin,"We felt very welcomed upon arrival and Lisa showed us what's available for us. The kitchen/pantry's offerings are generous with bread, muffins, eggs, milk, cornflakes, chocolates etc. Room was tastefully done. Wish you all the best!"
1136972,23572055,2014-12-05,4967851,Vicky,"Great place to stay. Lisa is a super friendly and helpful host, and the room was very cozy, even in the cold Boston winter. Having free transit passes allowed us to see many places, a lot of them having been recommended by Lisa. They also had a lot of useful stuff in the room, like sunscreen and plug adapters which come in very handy if your cellphone charger is from another country. I really recommend this place!"

1136972,24522209,2014-12-30,19443550,Cassandra,Lisa was very helpful with settling in and making us feel comfortable. The Airbnb experience really added to our satisfaction of being in Boston--quite possibly our favourite stop for this east coast trip.
The kitchen was well-stocked for breakfast,and we loved it so much we also cooked dinner. The free passes really helped alot in getting around the city as well.,,,,

1136972,28011547,2015-03-16,27501326,Alison,Lisa and Brian are really good host. We registered for two and had a friend join us last minute and they accommodated us with an extra bed in our room for a reasonable charge. They are really friendly and being comfortable really helped us meet the other residents also staying there. I like this more than staying in a hotel. They also have a dragon and a lot of board games.
1136972,28127177,2015-03-18,14124372,Shannon,Lisa was extremely helpful from before I even showed up at her house. She answered all of my questions quickly. Her home is spacious and very clean. A fresh breakfast is put out every morning. Clean sheets and towels are provided. The bathroom is right outside of your room which is convenient. Lisa offers complimentary unlimited T passes which are a big money saver and also very convenient. The bus stops right across the street from her house. If we had more time we would have taken advantage of Lisa's impressive game collection. I would definitely stay here again when in Boston.
1136972,28220292,2015-03-20,28521640,Briana,"\"Lisa greeted my boyfriend and I at the door and gave us a full tour of the house and explained all amenities. She and her husband were very helpful and made it clear that they were available to answer our questions about the house and provide tips about Boston. (Which was not surprising given how quickly she replies to emails).  I also misread the details on the room I booked and Lisa happily made re-arrangements for me. This is my first AirBnB experience and I am happy it was in Lisa's home. While street parking is available, the train station very close with a bus stop right across the street. The CharlieCards are a LIFESAVER. Being able to make mistakes on the \"\"T\"\" or just hop on a random train to explore somewhere new FOR FREE was awesome! The beds are cozy"
1136972,28597285,2015-03-27,17200762,Cathy,Geoff and I had a great week staying in a room in Lisa's flat.  The room and facilities were great and we made good use of the Charlie transport pass.  Lisa was very helpful with advice on how to get around.   The weather was very cold in March but the bus stops really are just outside and the buses come every 2-3 minutes and connect with the orange line.  The flat was warm and comfortable and there were good kitchen and cooking facilities as well as plenty of choice for breakfast including lots of fresh fruit.  There was even English tea.
1136972,28707436,2015-03-29,16152528,Martha,"Lisa and Brian were excellent hosts. The little things they provided like the snacks in our room, Charlie passes, breakfast foods, Netflix and popcorn, and advice on things to do were so special and greatly appreciated. Lisa was easy and fun to talk to. The location close to the subway and bus was terrific. The sheets on the bed were awesome and the bed was so comfortable we slept as well as we do at home. We are so glad we stayed here."

Lisa and her husband were very helpful. They even added a charlie pass for an extra person when my daughter's friend decided to come with us. The location is very close to the T which made going into Cambridge  & Boston very easy."
1136972,29615253,2015-04-10,28736686,Laszlo,"Die Umgebung Washington Street ist dort ein eher flach bebautes Misch-Wohn-/Gewerbegebiet mit kleineren New England-Wohnhäusern und starkem Busverkehr (6-8 Linien) von der Metrostation Forest Hills. Die Walins wohnen selbst im Haus und untervermieten per airbnb 2-3 Zimmer, die auch mal alle belegt sind. Es gibt je ein Bad mit WC im Erd- bzw. im Obergeschoss, die man gemeinsam benutzt."
Meine Gastgeber haben sich telefonisch per SMS rechtzeitig gemeldet,um mir den Zutritt zu gewähren. Das Zimmer (im Erdgeschoss) war einladend,ich war alleine und hatte Platz genug. Auch die Küche und der Gemeinschaftsraum (Obergeschoss) angenehm und großzügig. Es herrschte eine angenehme,lockere Atmosphäre,man kam auch mit den anderen Gästen leicht ins Gespräch. Die Freikarte der Bostoner Transportgesellschaft T für Metro und Busse ist großzügig von den Gastgebern,das macht den Aufenthalt entspannt und wird von allen Gästen sehr geschätzt. Am PC der Gastgeberin konnte ich meine Online-Check-in für den Heimflug erledigen. Großartig!
The surroundings Washington Street is a mixed habitation and enterprise zone,"having mostly 2-3-level houses of New England style and some shops. The Walins are living in one of these houses. From the metroline station \"\"Forest Hills\"\" coming",there is a strong bus service of 6-8 lines beginning from 4.30 am. There are 2 or 3 rooms for airbnb-guests,frequently used. For all persons there are two bathrooms (level 1 and 2 each).,,
Lisa had asked me early via texting about my arrival. There is a warm and kind atmosphere in their home,one feels easily like free. The room that I used twice is on this picture; it was enough for me alone,"maybe it were too small for two persons. The kitchen/dining room upstairs is a Meeting Point for guests and is really nice. Pure Orange Juice + coffee is free. We have got the free \"\"Charlie Card\"\" of the municipal Transport T for buses and Metro in Boston","that is generous. It made me the Expedition tours in Boston very uncomplicated. Lisa made me the online-checkin for my flight back to home possible as a matter of course. Great!\"",,
1136972,29792065,2015-04-12,28569753,Richard,"Lisa was a very gracious host and took time to show us around and answer any questions we had. The location was really close to the train station and the free metro passes made our trip into town very easy. Great little place , would stay there again."
1136972,30005123,2015-04-15,26669307,Alison,"Lisa was great to communicate with and very welcoming and hospitable. My stay in Boston was only 2 nights ....short but sweet, just time to do some sight seeing on my way back to London from visiting my daughter in Vermont. Getting around the city was easy, the  Charlie Pass was a great bonus!"
The bed in the Boston Room is SO comfy,I slept really well and although I was a bit concerned about sharing a bathroom,it was no problem at all... not sure what I was concerned about!,,,
I met some other guests who were very happy with their stay.,,,,,
"Unfortunately I didn't  get much time to chat to Lisa and only met Brian briefly but I would say their 5 star reviews are well deserved.  If I get the chance to go to Boston again I will definitely get in touch with them.\"",,,,,
1136972,30111258,2015-04-17,28648222,Catherine,"Lisa and Brian were very friendly. Brian welcomed me upon arrival and gave a tour of the apartment. The room was neat and clean with snacks and water. The bed was spacious and super comfy. The apartment location is very convenient if you need public transportation. Overall,  I enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to Boston visitors!"
1136972,30197947,2015-04-19,27851753,Lindsay,"Had the best time staying in Roslindale for the Boston Marathon! Lisa was the most incredible hostess. The house was like a little bed & breakfast -- cute, interesting decorations in themed rooms, a beautiful porch overlooking the area, walking distance from Jamaica Pond & the Arboretum, which offers a great view of downtown Boston, & tasty breakfast/coffee each morning. She even baked homemade banana bread. Since I have a gluten allergy, being able to prepare my dinner before the marathon was essential, so having the kitchen space and refrigerator to prepare & store food was awesome. Another great convenience were the Charlie Cards that Lisa provided -- we ended up using public transportation (subway, buses, etc) and were easily able to get around to all of the different neighborhoods in Boston for the marathon expo, various restaurants & bar scenes, the Red Sox game, & more! Lisa knows the area very well and can help you out with any questions in terms of selecting restaurants, local entertainment, & more. Would gladly book again for our next Boston visit!"
1136972,30459425,2015-04-22,29825571,Lee,Clean and tidy room just a short jaunt from the city center. Very friendly and helpful hosts. Transit passes and morning coffee were a great perk! Recommended.

The wonderful ambience of the home, the ridiculously comfy bed, and the overall generosity of Lisa and Brian made it a perfect weekend. Whether your staying for the night or the week, the location is a easy commute into the city, and the breakfast and metro-cards are an excellent perk. When we go back to Boston, we'll definitely be staying here again!"

They were flexible with last minute requests to make a space available for a 3rd guest; even providing us with another transit pass and set of keys.  Breakfast was accommodating, and Lisa  baked us cookies and provided some generous snacks.  Lisa and Brian even played us in Settlers of Catan!"
The neighborhood is good.  Super close to the Arboretum which is a gem for nature lovers and walk enthusiasts.  The location is very close to the Orange line,making transit simple.,,,,
Price of stay was very reasonable.  2 bathrooms are shared between 4 rooms of guests,but there never seemed to be much of a bathroom wait aside from a few minutes in the morning shower hours when people are leaving to start their day.,,,,

I drove to their house and it was easy to find a free street parking place. They offered almost everything, especially the unlimited traffic pass! I stayed in their Boston Room and it was very comfortable. I was also very satisfied with the wifi because I played games online a lot! The house was less than 10 minutes walk from the T station depends on how fast you walk. There was a big food store near by so if you want to cook in the kitchen it will be very convenient! Highly recommended to everyone!!!"

She even had a pack and play for my baby to sleep in.  It was nice to stay off the beaten path in Boston.

Lisa called us right away to welcome us. We got there so late that we were embarrassed to ring her bell. Lisa came out and received us with  open arms. She gave us a tour of the house.

Die Kommunikation vor unserer Reise war super und schnell. Auch die Beschreibung wie wir vom Busbahnhof zum Haus kommen, war detailgenau und leicht (auch dann vor Ort) nachzuvollziehen und überhaupt kein Problem. Vor Ort wurden wir sofort herzlich willkommen und fühlten uns direkt wohl. Lisa führte uns kurz im Haus herum und gab uns kleine Tips für die erste Entdeckungstour der Stadt.

Le quartier est tranquille (un peu isolé), agréable, à quelques pas de l'Arboretum d'Arnold (Majestueux et ressourçant) et pas très loin du Quartier Jamaica Plain que j'ai adoré. La chambre était parfaitement confortable et joli, pas un grand luxe mais comme à la maison. Pour le prix c'est respectable.

She even let us store our bags in the house after check out while we went to the ball game.  Unfortunately we didn't have a chance to meet Brian, but want to thank them both for a great weekend and would recommend without hesitation."
1136972,46730650,2015-09-13,39724065,Sarah,Lisa was a great host! We arrived to freshly baked cookies. The Charlie cards made it very convenient to travel all over Boston. Definitely would stay here again.
1136972,47252084,2015-09-17,37422168,Andrew,Lisa was a great host. Everything the website listed was provided and more. She certainly exceeded our expectations. This was a great first experience with AirbnB.
1136972,47777728,2015-09-21,36557443,Ashley,If you're trying to find a place to stay and Lisa has an opening TAKE IT!!! I had never been to Boston before and I don't think I could have found a better place to stay for my first trip. Lisa was so welcoming and willing to answer any and all of my questions regarding the city (and I had a lot). She provided me with easy instructions on how to get to their home from the airport (and it was free) using public transit. The free T passes were great and I am all about saving some money. The place was just as described and the chocolate chip cookies were a definite perk. I will absolutely be back to visit Boston and I hope Lisa has an open spot when I do!
1136972,48012534,2015-09-22,37512172,Yoshino,チェックインが1時だったが、12時には準備が出来ているので荷物を置いてゆっくりしていいよとリサに言ってもらえました。サンフランシスコから深夜のフライトで時差ぼけもあったのでとても助かりました。翌日も次のお客さんが遅いチェックインだから夕方までいても大丈夫と言ってもらえとても助かりました。まるで親戚の家に来たような感覚でおもてなしの精神をとても感じました。
1136972,48263457,2015-09-25,25204195,Meryl,Lisa was very welcoming and everything was as the listing showed. All the little extras such as charlie cards and cookies were great. The location is good. A very easy walk to the train.
1136972,49733262,2015-10-05,17826288,Vanessa,Lisa and Brian were great hosts: answered every question and gave great recommendations. Their home is cozy and in a great location. We're planning another trip to the Boston area soon and will definitely stay with them again.
1136972,49853697,2015-10-06,43311821,Xinyu,"Lisa is a very nice and helpful host.I had great night at her lovely (URL HIDDEN) arriving,she gave us long massages about getting there information,historical spots in Boston,tasty restaurants and so on.These information are useful and detailed.When we arrived there,she gave us a tour of her (URL HIDDEN) living room has a projector and some games,however we were in a hurry and had no time to enjoy them.The dining-room on second floor is well equipped and the snack bar looks great.Thanks for the wonderful night at Lisa's (URL HIDDEN) has been the greatest experience of Airbnb."
1136972,49909932,2015-10-07,43523550,Jane,This was my first time ever using airbnb and will definitely again.
I only stayed with Lisa one night but would love to again- great comfy bed,"homely feel and s great welcoming smile from Lisa on my arrival\"",,,,
1136972,50088338,2015-10-09,13658822,Joyce And Al,Lisa did a good job at making us feel welcome.  The  property is in a good location for getting around using public transportation.  Lisa is very helpful in providing information.
1136972,50429356,2015-10-12,18860932,Justin,"Rundum gelungener Aufenthalt! Sehr bequemes Bett, schönes Zimmer! Topservice von Lisa, Frühstück und Metrocard inbegriffen! Zwar nicht zentral gelegen, aber alles gut erreichbar, Bushaltestelle direkt vor dem Haus... Haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt, jederzeit wieder!!!"
1136972,50827250,2015-10-15,18470576,John,"Lisa was warm and welcoming.  There was a host of information about the local area, as well as the City.  It was easy to contact Brian and Lisa during the stay if you needed them but the layout of the house meant that you could come and go without feeling that you were disrupting them or the other guests.  It was a simple journey on the T into the city and an easy 10 minute walk from the station to the house.  The room was well-equipped and although there was a bit of street noise in the morning, earplugs were provided so it was not an issue."
1136972,50950661,2015-10-16,44784689,Jessica,"This was my first airbnb experience, and it was wonderful. Lisa is super friendly and provides everything you need and more. I loved the provided snacks and home made cookies! The list of things to do in the area was really helpful to me, and having the Charlie card to use during my stay was a big help too.  I can't say enough good things about my stay! I would definitely book again when staying in Boston"
1136972,52311994,2015-10-28,18658652,Cary,"Awesome once again! We look forward to going to Boston just to stay here as much as the trip itself. Very nice place with super nice hosts, right on the transit line. Had a great time, be back soon!"
1136972,52540502,2015-10-30,8477798,Margaret,"This was my first time using airbnb and Lisa was very helpful with the logistics, the process.  Very friendly welcome, tour of home, amenities provided matched the website.  House was clean, sharing was not a problem as there were two full bathrooms.  The noise from the street was a bit of an issue, but the sound machine helped."
Loved the fresh cookies,"the breakfast options were many.  \"",,,,
1136972,53136247,2015-11-05,45749780,Maureen,"Lisa was a great host.  I arrived after 9pm, and she was there to greet me at the door and then gave me a fun tour of her home.  You can tell she enjoys being a host as her home is super accommodating for guests to settle in and enjoy a second home away from home. I was in to attend a conference and took the T in to town everyday.  It was so generous to offer the unlimited Charlie Card for use, and the train stop is a quick and easy walk just a few blocks away. Thank you very much."
1136972,53235936,2015-11-06,40740158,Justin,Great experience!  Lisa was a really great and friendly host.  Room was perfect and close to public transit.  Would definitely recommend and stay again.
1136972,53542676,2015-11-09,35288145,Ben,First; I'd like to start by saying that our experience with Lisa was great and would recommend 100%. If that's all you need to book your trip - go for it.... If you need additional details then keep reading.
Second; Lisa welcomed us into her home and started with a great tour. She then answered questions and provided tons of information about the area.,,,,,
Third; did I mention the cookies? Wow. She can bake and even shares.,,,,,
Fourth; the bus/train passes. That was the selling point for me mainly because I like to feel like I'm getting a deal and not having to pay for train-fairs was just the ticket!,,,,,
Fifth; if you want to save a few bucks then Airbnb with Lisa is the way to go. We were downtown within 15-20 minutes & didn't have to deal with traffic.,,,,,
Final remarks; I live downtown in Columbus,OH and have been considering becoming an airBNB host. Lisa politely answered questions and provided honest feedback from her experience the last few years. Bottom line - talking wth Lisa has provided Amanda and I the confidence of possibly becoming a host in the near future.,,,,
Enjoy Boston!,,,,,
"PS - make sure to stop at Neptune Oyster and order a lobster roll... It's worth the wait.\"",,,,,
1136972,54007567,2015-11-15,46873845,Elaine,"Lisa is very friendly and help us a lot when we stayed in Boston. She is thoughtful and prepare many things you need for free, included the Charlie Card, It's very helpful. Thank you, Lisa & Brian."

Providing the travel cot helped us with our limited luggage a lot. And generally being so nice with him made us feel at ease. Good range of food and drink provided at breakfast and lots of helpful info available about the area. The travel cards made the trip a bit more hassle free and were much appreciated."

It is conveniently  located, close to public transit, and includes a transit pass. Lisa does a really good job making sure that her guests have everything they need to explore Boston effectively, including maps, a good guest guide, and cookies. Ohh hey, thanks for the cookies. :)"
1136972,55858332,2015-12-06,4859481,Justine,"Lisa is an amazing host. She is very warm and welcoming and made sure to provide us with everything we needed. She even baked us cookies!

1136972,56208180,2015-12-10,6598906,Quyen,Staying with Lisa and Brian has been the best airbnb experience we've had. They're both lovely people and have covered every little detail to make our stay both easy and delightful. Would fully recommend.

1136972,58266766,2016-01-02,401184,Robert,"Lisa was really friendly when I arrived after a long day of travel, giving me a tour of the apartments and pointing out helpful details. The chocolate on the bed was a lovely touch! I felt very safe in the neighbourhood and the connections to public transport are so convenient, especially with the free Charlie cards provided! They gave me loads of information about the area and things to do. The apartment itself was great, very comfortable bed, fast internet, books/tv/home movie theatre provided and good breakfast options in the morning. Thanks for a fantastic, if short, stay in Boston!"
1136972,59289088,2016-01-09,47622616,Kara,"Staying with Lisa and Bryan was wonderful! The space was nice, it felt like I was staying at my apartment back at home. The kitchen space was great and had pretty much everything you needed to cook. The food selection was definitely a plus as well as the coffee!  Lisa was very friendly, available when needed and fun to just talk to. The location of her place was perfect. Just a 5-10 min walk to the train (you could opt to take the bus which is right outside of her place across the street in case you didn't want to walk). There was also a nice little grocery store (just a 5 min walk). I would I highly recommend this place to any of my friends or family. It felt like you were staying in your very own bed and breakfast."
1136972,59596401,2016-01-12,9270379,Qi,"Lisa has a very lovely house. The room I stayed in was large, comfortable and well-heated. I had a great stay."
1136972,59762822,2016-01-15,24284876,Jessica,"Lisa was a great host! She allowed us to check in a little early without any problem. The room is as described, you are able to control the heat in the room and the mattress is super comfortable. The bathroom is shared but we were the only people staying at the time so we didn't have any issues. A light breakfast is provided every morning and you are able to use the kitchen when needed! She  went out of her way to make us feel welcome and even helped us print out some tour tickets. Her place is a bit far from Downtown Boston but the neighborhood is great and public transportation is easily accessible - plus she provides unlimited bus/subway passes! Would definitely recommend to stay at her place :)"
1136972,59924982,2016-01-17,52096936,Stephanie,"Lisa and Brian were great. Very welcoming and the room was just as described. The unlimited bus/train passes were very convenient! If I ever come to Boston again, this place would be my first option."

1136972,60492396,2016-01-24,52097825,Matthew,So this was my first time using Airbnb and I'm glad to say that it won't be my last. Lisa was a wonderful host - the place itself was very accommodating (the free transit passes were a godsend) and Lisa was available for whatever need my girlfriend and I had.
From the beginning,we received a tour of the home. Everything is as advertised...plus there's an awesome bearded dragon! The house has a bus stop literally across the street that you can take to the T,which will take you anywhere in Boston.,,,
My girlfriend and I were out and about and were rarely inside the house so we didn't really interact with Lisa and Brian too much. Regardless,we had everything we needed which equated to a lovely stay. Beds are super comfy. Highly recommend staying here,"thanks for everything Lisa & Brian!\"",,,
1136972,61295094,2016-02-02,4522319,Luis,Perfect place
To be in Boston!!!,,,,,
Thank you so much,"Lisa!!!\"",,,,
1136972,61533568,2016-02-05,33874513,Steven,"Our host Lisa was remarkably warm, friendly, and quite helpful.  The location is quite close to public transportation and Jamaica Plain Center has some wonderful restaurants and is about 15 minutes away by foot.   We ate at the Center St. Café where we enjoyed a delicious char fish dinner.  It is quite remarkable how many experiences Lisa has had with such diverse guests from all over the globe.  Had a wonderful breakfast of oatmeal and toast.  Finally, a special treat was the electric blanket for the bed, which kept us warm and toasty the whole night.  Highly recommended for a positive experience in Boston."
1136972,61665239,2016-02-07,54239119,Thomas,"Had a very comfortable stay at with Lisa at the Boston Room! Definitely recommended for a cozy easy location in Boston. Ask about Kaiju the bearded dragon, he is a real celebritiy!"

1136972,65942753,2016-03-18,33397028,Rachel Alyse,"Lisa was extremely accommodating to our schedule, as we arrived slightly earlier than check-in time. The space was exactly what we expected, and closer to the public transit than we thought. It was perfect."
1136972,66180363,2016-03-20,41825627,Fabien,"Lisa was nice and welcoming. The room was almost clean despite a bad smell into it. But the bathroom was not clean at all. Many hairs in the toilet bowl, in the bath and the sink. The rest of the ap was also dirty : food under the living table, dust everywhere. Even if it is a shared apartment, we don't understand why it was that dirty, sorry. The location was good however, the bus passes just across, and the subway is only 2 bus stops."
1136972,66376977,2016-03-22,53345246,Arnold,Airbnb auf einem ganz neuen Niveau.
Die Gastgeber tun so ziemlich alles damit man sich Zuhause fühlt. Von sehr gutem Frühstück bis zur eigenen Küche und man kann sogar kostenlos popcorn machen und Netflix gucken wenn man möchte.  Ansonsten war das Zimmer ziemlich ruhig obwohl das haus an einer großen Straße steht.,,,,,
Es super wie in einem kleinen Familie-hotel.,,,,,
Ansonsten ist man in ca. 20min von der Haustür in der Innenstadt von Boston dank der frei zu Verfügung gestellten bus-&bahntickets.,,,,,

1136972,70280530,2016-04-17,65470605,Daniel,"What can I say about Lisa and Brian's place.  My fiancée and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at their Airbnb.  This was the first time I used Airbnb, and I hope every experience in the future leads me to a place like Lisa and Brian's.  They supply a lot information from local places to visit, eat, and Boston landmarks. They supply clean towels and sheets. Breakfast in the morning was a major plus as well as the ability to use a projector screen to watch Netflix at night (cannot forget about the popcorn you can make).  Unfortunately we were not able to stay and enjoy the amenities such as the Netflix or board games but the breakfast  was perfect. The Charlie cards were one of the main draws to this place originally, but what will make us come back is the friendliness of Lisa and Brian's bed and breakfast"
1136972,71719582,2016-04-27,53755621,Melinda,My friend and I stayed at Lisa's on April 25-27. Our experience was great! Lisa is a very welcoming host and she really took the time to make us confortable. She is truly attentive even to small little details and this made our first experience with Airbnb a success! She deserves all these amazing reviews! Thank you for our wondeful time in Boston! :)
1136972,71887823,2016-04-29,22884500,Allison,"Lisa and Brian were exceptional hosts. The neighborhood was great, and it was definitely within walking distance of public transportation.  I was also impressed by the excellent service and attention to detail and thoughtfulness of the hosts.  In addition, everything was clean and orderly in the place, and the fellow guests were kind and courteous. Moreover,It wasn't a problem to share bathrooms with other guests, despite the fact that the place was fully booked.  I have to say that it was one of my better business trip lodgings. In fact, I would recommend it 100% to friends, colleges, and family. Thank you!"
1136972,72277936,2016-05-01,27813051,Michelle,"Lisa was the best host!!! I have only had amazing experiences with Airbnb and Lisa was no exception! Her place is very clean and comfortable. She provides a real hospitality environment from the fresh breakfast every morning to the towels & chocolates. She is always within reach and is incredibly considerate to your plans and needs. I felt very welcomed and warm at her place. It is super convenient to enter the subway as well. This was my first time traveling alone and she made it stress free!!! The free transit she provides was absolutely the most helpful thing for me as I was by myself. She's informative, friendly, and everything you need! It's very obvious why she is labeled a superhost! Thank you Lisa and Brian!"

The room was just as described,Lisa has thought of everything you might need during your stay,and the transit passes are super handy. With those passes,we could easily get to anywhere we wanted. I sincerely recommend staying here to anyone travelling to the Boston area.,,

1136972,75464685,2016-05-21,58820566,Lihua,"The room is beautiful and comfortable, and we can cook meal in the kitchen with the food in the refri. The transport card is a good idea!

Lisa makes the best chocolate cookie, and Brian is so helpful with the movie projector. Yes, we enjoyed our time watching Netflix on their comfortable sofa. They even provide free unlimited transit pass. They also showed us nice places to visit and have dinner. Next time I'll still choose here when I visit again."
1136972,77218493,2016-05-30,9309995,Benoit,"Lisa and Brian are wonderful hosts, they'll do their best to make you feel at home. They provided a crib for our baby and woven toys he really enjoyed playing with. The room was quiet, the Harvard arboretum nearby is really worth a long visit, there are buses all the time to go to the train station. Real great airbnb experience!"
1136972,77664438,2016-06-02,51542560,Miranda,Great people and great place! Will stay again if I return to Boston!

The breakfast has everything you need! The house is big and quiet, good for familys or who travels alone. The house is in front of a bus stop, that takes you straight to the metro Station! Great experience! Thanks Lisa"
1136972,78185706,2016-06-05,69118876,Ron,Lisa was a very gracious host and the room was all you could ask for. Location was excellent (loved running in the Harvard Arboretum) and appreciated the access to food (even accessible at 2AM when I had to leave). Wish I could have spent a couple more days there (I was essentially an overnight guest) but the free MBTA pass would have been great to travel the city with.
1136972,79887706,2016-06-14,46858476,Anna,"As soon as we arrived at Lisa's lovely house we received a warm welcome and were made to feel at home. The room had everything we needed and the maps and suggestion booklets were very handy! But the best thing about the Boston room is the bed. It is huge and SO COMFORTABLE! We had 4 great night sleeps during our visit because of this bed. The location is great, only a 10 minute walk to the tube station and the free Charlie cards were fantastic, we could get straight into the centre of Boston with ease. Also around the Forest Hills and Roslindale area there are some lovely places to eat. We went to Redd's in Rozzie (recommended by Lisa) and it was brilliant! Also Sophia's Grotto in Roslindale was cute. There is also a beautiful walk around the Arboretum, you can find a map in the room, with amazing views. Another great feature of this stay was the breakfast. There was always a good selection of things and it set us up nicely for our days out exploring. Overall we had a fantastic stay in the Boston room and would love to come again when next in the area. Thank you Lisa and Brian!"
1136972,80814569,2016-06-19,25331908,Adam,Had a great stay. Felt at home the whole time.
1136972,80991584,2016-06-20,58353526,Robert,"This was my second time staying with Lisa and Brian.  It was a bit like coming home this time, and I was greeted by the familiar:  fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies, a Lindor truffle on the bed, and the general warmth and ambiance of a real home.  I see no reason to change what is becoming, for me, a pleasant habit."
1136972,81205548,2016-06-21,2344493,Marx,"While we stayed for just one night, we found Lisa and her husband to be warm and patient hosts to my wife and I. The room was comfortable and we got to meet their wonderful pet."
We would definitely recommend the place if you're in the Boston area.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1136972,81544970,2016-06-23,69646574,Brooke,Lisa and Brian were wonderful hosts and accommodated our late arrival after midnight. Everything was as described and very comfortable. Their house is so convenient to the T and the Charlie cards they provide are huge life savers!!! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and only wish we would have had more time to enjoy the amenities they offer like the movie area.
1136972,81730264,2016-06-24,24019934,Jackie,Great location!
Thanks for all the help,"suggestions and wonderful stay for our short trip to Boston!!! \"",,,,
1136972,82185444,2016-06-26,31510210,Chris,Lisa was very nice and obviously enjoys dealing with people.
The room was clean and as described. She helped us with our list of things we wanted to see. The passes for transport helped.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1136972,82651222,2016-06-28,34353918,Marianne,Warm welcome by Lisa giving us all necessary info to make us feel at home at her place. She is a real SUPERHOST! We much appreciated the public transportation card and the breakfast she offered to us. Good connections to next metro station. We really recommend this place!
1136972,82794153,2016-06-29,74376126,David,Lisa was there to greet us when we arrived. She was very nice and helped get to Boston. The included public transport passes are really handy!
1136972,83534663,2016-07-03,26073379,Nate,Lisa was fantastic. The location is premium just a short walk to the T and she gave us free passes. Fantastic stay would definitely recommend.
1136972,84414133,2016-07-07,77119790,Sarah,"Lisa and Brian's place is such a gem! This listing is exactly as shown. The free T passes make this a super extra valuable place to stay, not to mention the opportunity to make eggs and toast for breakfast with a good cup of coffee from the keurig. Lisa's thought of everything a person could need to be comfortable and make this their home away from home."
"My husband and I were probably a little spoiled during our visit because the other guest room on our floor was empty so we weren't sharing the main bath on that floor with other guests. When we made our meals we enjoyed getting to meet some of the guests staying upstairs. If we ever need a place to stay in Boston again this will be the first listing I check to book again!\"",,,,,
1136972,85762962,2016-07-13,20644136,Bill,"Excellent stay in a comfortable, convenient and safe location. Lisa is a gracious host and was extremely helpful in providing advice and directions to a first time visitor to the Boston area.  The complimentary Charlie Card was invaluable.  The bus stop is literally across the street from the house and two minutes from the nearest subway station (Forest Hills).  In less than 20 minutes you are downtown.  I parked my  car in front of the house and did not need it for the entire stay.  I Highly recommend Lisa's B&B."
1136972,85893422,2016-07-13,27571270,Mario,Lisa est accueillante. La maison est vielle mais bien organisée pour acceuillir les gens. La chambre était belle mais le matelas était trop mou. La propreté générale de la maison laisse à désirer. Lisa est facile à rejoindre et nous a rendu service avec notre téléphone cellulaire perdu.
1136972,87056594,2016-07-18,72047142,Vera,"Our stay at Lisa's house was fantastic. She and her husband made us feel like home. Everything was clean and the bed was very comfortable.  There were some little snacks like crackers, granola bars and little water bottles in our room, we appreciated that very much. In the morning we also had great and fresh breakfast. The unlimited charlie card were brilliant and made our stay in boston so easy. Thanks that was so generous. We   mostly met Lisa and brian in the evening and had little talks. They were very kind and helped us with everything. Thank you very much,  you were great hosts!"
1136972,87666509,2016-07-21,6666877,Mario,Arrived quite a bit later than expected but found the apartment instantly with Lisa's directions.
Lisa was very welcoming and helpful,did anything to make sure we've got everything we need. We even got to see her bearded dragon dress up!,,,,
We've got good use out of the complimentary bus tickets,that was a huge bonus!,,,,
The place is really spacious and equipped with everything you can imagine from breakfast options to city maps,Netflix and bath amenities.,,,,
"Will definitely stay again when coming to Boston! \"",,,,,
1136972,87924094,2016-07-22,66911902,Madison,I had a great experience at Lisa's place.  She was super nice and the airbnb was stocked with everything you can think of!
1136972,89219694,2016-07-27,80692073,Steven,"Lisa was great.  She responded to my text in a timely manner, and was very accomidating.  She even stayed up late to make us cookies,  The room was exactly as discribed, and while we had a neighbor right next door, we never heard any other noises.  We were in tourest mode during our time there, so spent little time at the home itself.  The T pass was a valuable asset, and made it that much easier to move around Boston without the hassle of driving and finding parking.  Saved money by using it."
1136972,90351058,2016-07-31,72303827,Michael,Lisa was an awesome host. She gave a lot of good recommendations and was very kind and helpful. Everything at her home was exactly as described. The included public transportation and the subway stop in the neighborhood makes it a perfect place for exploring Boston.
1136972,91338573,2016-08-05,77694960,Sandra,Nous sommes arrivé vers 22h30 et notre hôte nous a accueilli avec le sourire malgré qu'il était tard. Lisa a pris le temps de tout nous expliquer ce qu'on pouvait faire a Boston même si on passait seulement une nuit chez elle. Merci Lisa pour ton chaleureux accueil.
1136972,91465845,2016-08-05,86798978,Lillian,Terrific!!!! Very warm and comfortable house that I've never seen before
1136972,92045289,2016-08-07,25923301,Madellen,"The bedroom was as described, the bed was very comfortable. Lisa was very friendly and helped me check in and get sorted. The place had quite a few rooms being let out to other people which I hadn't realised, it made the place feel very much like a hostel. Which is fine, but just not what I was expecting."
1136972,92562702,2016-08-09,54627032,Taylor,Lisa was a great host and the location was perfect for getting to Downtown Boston. The house is located in the perfect spot for jumping on the bus or train to get around. I would definitely stay there again!
1136972,92662092,2016-08-09,8178623,Quetura,Lisa was very friendly and helpful and the apartment was very easy to get to. They had a nice self serve continental breakfast upstairs and  We loved watching Netflix on the projector.  We would stay here again.
1136972,93219980,2016-08-12,83508653,David,Great
1136972,93982237,2016-08-14,20764774,Alicia,Lisa was a great host! It was very easy to communicate woth her. The room was as shiwn in the pictures. Very clean and nice. The house is very well conected to the city center by public transportation.
Lisa gave us a little welcome kit,including maps and suggestions and breakfast was included and was very good :),,,,
"I would recommend to stay woth her\"",,,,,
1136972,95490711,2016-08-20,78913998,Sylvia,"When we arrived, we were greeted and shown around the house. There was a good common space with lots of available activities (games, movies). The room was tidy and the mattress quite comfortable."
1136972,95984575,2016-08-21,87855311,Julia,We loved our stay! Lisa and her husband were great host. they were very attentive to our needs. It was a great place to rest after exploring the city. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!
12208307,81198213,2016-06-21,54209924,Jeremy,"Ben's place was fantastic! He was very communicative and made sure I had a great stay over 6 days in south Boston. His roommate was also easy-going, considerate, and very helpful for settling in and getting to know the area. There are many restaurants, bars, shops and amenities close by, and the subway is a 10 minute walk down the road - it is close to everything you need (including the convention center and harbour)."
Ben's house is clean,well kept and quiet. There is a great amount of privacy and almost no street traffic - I had absolutely no trouble falling asleep. The washroom was very clean and well stocked as well. In all,a very laid-back,quiet and tidy atmosphere. I would definitely stay at Ben's place again,"and would recommend it to others as well.\"",
14474114,98737253,2016-09-01,30611607,Tenzin,"My sister and I needed a place to stay for a few nights while we were moving apartments and were extremely happy to find Asad's place. He and his roommates were great, very friendly, and he even offered us a ride to the grocery store to pick up food. The place was beautiful, well-kept and clean. He was good at making us feel welcome but also giving us privacy and peace. I can see him being a great host for travelers who don't know the area well or who have more time than we unfortunately did to chat with him."
14091605,87726612,2016-07-21,15056065,Jennifer,"My stay was wonderful! The accommodations were extremely comfortable and impeccably clean. Drew made sure I had all the amenities I would need and then some including clean towels, clean sheets, access to dish ware and utensils, and wifi. He even had water, juice, ice cream, and some grab and go items for breakfast."
The guest sleeping area was in a lofted area that you accessed by a metal spiral staircase. There was a double or maybe a queen bed up there with very comfortable sheets and down comforter. Although the apartment did have air conditioning,Drew was kind enough to put a fan up there in case it got too hot. I personally was comfortable up there the whole time and slept extremely well. There wasn't too much room for baggage up there but I only had my overnight bag which fit just fine.,,,,
The South End neighborhood in Boston is lovely and Drew's building was located on a very lovely square across from a park with a beautiful fountain. I felt extremely safe in the area and in Drew's building.,,,,,
Lastly,Drew was an extremely nice,"quiet and respectful host and I highly recommend him and his apartment and would definitely stay again if I have another trip to Boston.\"",,,
14091605,88301796,2016-07-24,51506575,Farzan,"Drew was a good host and made us feel welcome. He responds to questions within hours and makes sure to address every concern. The apartment is situated in front of a small park in a largely residential area, and is conveniently close to the popular Newbury street, which makes good restaurants and nightlife easily accessible (~15-20 minutes walking). Drew's place is a nice, modern loft at the top of his complex, with plenty of natural lighting and overall very cleanly feel. Our bed was located in a small loft that overlooks the living room area. Since the loft is open to the living room, it didn't feel completely private. However, we felt comfortable sharing the space. Overall, it was a pleasure to be Drew's first guests and we'd recommend him as a host."
14091605,88567989,2016-07-24,84788519,Stephanie,Drew told us exactly what to expect. He was available when we needed him and gave us fun recommendations for things to to in the area.  He was a pleasant host and we enjoyed staying with him!
14091605,89202770,2016-07-27,28296243,Sherrelle,I only stayed one night however I enjoyed my stay. Drews home was well kept the bed was super comfy as well. He provided my friend and I with clean towels and wash clothes and suggestions of places to eat.  He was very communicative before we arrived as well. It's also located in a great area. Our plane landed a little later than expected so when I informed Drew of that he still made accommodations for us to be able to check in. I would def recommend staying here. The room is loft style to keep in mind but still comfortable.
14091605,91470113,2016-08-05,85724496,Judah,"Really nice apartment, fun neighborhood, host was warm and hospitable. He made sure we had everything we needed and was very accommodating to our schedule. However, loft area was not as private as described. Would recommend the apartment for solo adventurers, not couples. Spiral staircase leading to loft was really narrow and I couldn't stand straight in the loft."
14091605,91709909,2016-08-06,56115210,Sophie,"We had a lovely stay at Drew's place! His apartment is beautiful and perfectly located. Drew was friendly and helpful, providing everything we needed. We will definitely stay at his place again next time we're in Boston."
14091605,92047911,2016-08-07,80244083,Aurélien,"Nice loft, nice host, I recommend Drew's place!"
14091605,92396606,2016-08-08,81759026,Sarah,"My sister and I stayed for a night and loved it! A short walk from shops, eateries, and bars-- Drew's spot is very clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!"
14091605,92906811,2016-08-10,84360944,Gabriel,"Drew is a great host! Before arriving, he was replying to all our questions really quickly.  He keeps is place really clean and he was always available. The location is just awesome by being at a walk distance from the core of the city. Great neighborhood, great host. The experience is just as it would be if we were real roommates (good communication and respect)"
"Thanks again Drew!\"",,,,,
14091605,93193011,2016-08-11,72569966,Jeff,This was our first Airbnb experience. Drew was a great host in an up-and-coming Boston neighborhood. It is an open loft but that wasn't really an issue for us. Drew was also really great in that he let us keep our bags there for the day because we had just flown in from overseas and didn't have anywhere to keep them. We would highly recommend Drew's place for anyone who needs a quick semi-private room for a night or two.
14091605,93482033,2016-08-13,73530720,Marc,Great place for someone travelling alone and or a young couple. The loft is accessible by a tiny spiral staircase which makes for a challenging ascent with suitcase. Drew was very quiet and respectul. Thanks again!
14091605,93728158,2016-08-13,89019528,Maja,Great host. I was very pleased with his pleasant and friendly nature as well as with his flexibility. Very clean and affordable place in a beautiful neighborhood. Great overall experience for a quick stay! Would definitely recommend it!!
14091605,95643140,2016-08-20,60350723,Kaitlyn,"Perfect location at a great price. Drew was a great host, communicated with us very well before and during our stay. The apartment was very clean and homey. Would definitely recommend!"
14091605,96005267,2016-08-21,86387016,Molly,"Drew's place was perfect for my first self-organized Airbnb trip. The located was great--it was located close enough to downtown Boston for us to conveniently able to see all the sights, but was in a quiet and (seemingly) safe neighborhood. Drew was very nice and accommodating and answered all of our questions well. The space was small and not very private, but that was well described on the listing page and in other reviews. Also the shower was really nice! All in all, great stay."
14091605,96400454,2016-08-22,24774712,Jessica,Drew's place was a great spot to rest as I had been traveling a lot beforehand. His loft is decorated well and was very clean. Towels were ready and so was complimentary breakfast. Great location. I barely saw Drew but during our interactions he was very nice.
14091605,97860846,2016-08-28,35036677,Sijia,Very nice place I would recommend everyone go stay there. The host is very nice person. Nothing is bad.
14091605,99336161,2016-09-04,15873290,Aryeh,Drew was nice and helpful. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The loft staircase was narrow and probably wouldn't accommodate larger people.
315982,972149,2012-03-05,1213252,Rémi,Hermina's appartment is very nice. She welcomed us with the breakfast for the next morning and it was a pleasure. It had been possible to park the car easily in the street of the house.
