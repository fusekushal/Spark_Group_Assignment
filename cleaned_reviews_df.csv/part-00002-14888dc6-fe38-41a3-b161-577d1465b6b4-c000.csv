"It's a good choice to journey in boston.\"",,,,,
315982,1041387,2012-03-25,695000,Lenny,"This apartment turned out to be suitable to our specific needs – we were on a business trip and needed an inexpensive space with a common area for two people. For that, it was great."
In terms of the overall location,it backs up to a police station and isn't in the nicest of Boston's neighborhoods. If I were to return to Boston as a tourist it wouldn't be my first choice. If you're looking for a decent apartment South of the city,"it's fine – I just wouldn't spend much time walking around alone at night.\"",,,
315982,1113050,2012-04-12,1848028,Michael,"The appartment was beautiful and spacious. Equipment was very good and additionally there was coffee, cereals,... ."
We felt very safe,because there is a Police Station next to the house.,,,,
"Hermina is a very nice host and she made us feel home in this appartment.\"",,,,,
315982,1154506,2012-04-20,1780267,Nils,"Really loved this place,  train is in short walking distance and Hermina was beein a perfect host :)"
315982,1252293,2012-05-09,1815130,Melissa,"Hermina was very sweet and helpful.  She took my friend to the market with her and gave her a lay of the land which my friend was very happy about.  The apartment was a little tired but clean, comfortable, stocked with a few handy supplies and groceries, wifi, and the price was right.  The neighborhood shopping area is neglected and run down.  However the local sports bar--Blarney Stone--had great Italian food.  The subway stop was very convenient to the house and easy to get to from the airport.  Thanks Hermina, this is a great service for short-term travelers!"
315982,1296485,2012-05-17,1340007,Roger,"The place was exactly as described, very comfortable and spacious for the 3 of us. We were on a business trip and needed a quiet place to prepare for a presentation. Hermina was kind and easy to communicate with. The house is a few blocks away from the Red Line and about a 15 minute subway ride from South station. Overall I recommend the townhouse and Hermina as a host."

315982,1751734,2012-07-20,1774762,Ronald,"Unfortunately we didn't met Hermina in person, but in correspondance she is very kind."
The appartment is very complete with all luxery.,,,,,
We only happened to stay there during the 2 hottest days of the century in Boston and with that in mind the local airco downstairs was sufficient for downstairs,but in the 2 bedrooms upstairs the ceiling fans could not cope with it. We guess this is an exception,"normally it should work. The neighbourhood shops provide you with all you need and there are good Vietnamese restaurants. The T-red is 5 min walk.\"",,,
315982,1921829,2012-08-08,1945827,Rosemary And David,"Hermina was very helpful and went out of her way to assist us in anyway she could ,however the accommodation  was basic and lacked airconditioning  which we found tedious in the heat  ,the property is old and needs maintenance"
315982,1938758,2012-08-10,2223214,Tulio,Apartment is very good and Hermina is really aware of all your needs during our stay. I recommended.
315982,1957002,2012-08-12,2104034,Veronika,It is a nice house very convenient for a trip to boston. T-line station is right around the corner.
"\"",,,,,
315982,2052666,2012-08-21,398838,Will,"Hermina is a great host. We got the 2-room apartment which is very spacious, with 1.5 baths and a large living room and kitchen area. Parking was very easy during the day -- we often parked just one or two houses away. In the evening there were fewer parking spaces I think because of the restaurant on the far end of the block, so we sometimes had to park a little further down the (same) block."
315982,2096849,2012-08-26,1723984,Karin,It was a nice time in this house. We would recommande this place for a Boson-City-Trip. You can drive easily and directly to the citycentre and to Cambridge.
315982,2308686,2012-09-17,3250381,Gérald,"Hermina est une femme charmante et sa maison de ville spacieuse et très agréable. Elle est proche des transports en commun et de l'autre côté du parc le quartier est fait des plus belles maisons typiques de la nouvelle angleterre, pour qui aime l'architecture."
Non loin de là,on peut rejoindre la marina et une plage.,,,,
"Ce quartier est cependant presqu'à 100% asiatique et afro-américain. Mais vous remarquerez que je lui mets quand même 5 étoiles.\"",,,,,
315982,2343547,2012-09-19,2394903,Terry,Hermina was a great host. Checked to see if we needed anything and suggested venues to suit our needs. Close to subway which makes it easy to commute. Would recommend as safe and I would stay there again.
Thanks Hermina.,,,,,

315982,2367463,2012-09-22,1775288,Gaëtan,Le séjour chez Hermina s'est très bien passé pour nous mais nous avons été un peu déçu de la propreté des draps et de la maison en général et l'accueil rapide de l'hôtesse.
En revanche,la maison est jolie,typique,bien située (un métro à deux pas qui vous emmène dans le centre de Boston en 15 minutes) et avec toutes les commodités (lave-linge,cuisine,wifi).
Pour deux jours,"c'était très bien surtout que nous avons adoré Boston !!  \"",,,,
315982,2434970,2012-09-28,2957376,Jochen,"Nice host, nice apartment!"
315982,2527606,2012-10-07,2576579,Jan,Very helpful lady.
315982,2616188,2012-10-15,3504507,Vonnet,"Place was exactly as pictured/advertised. Our stay was very comfortable, and our 2 year old toddler who can be very picky about accomodations while travelling enjoyed it. Easy street parking and easy access to some really really good Vietnamese food. 15 minute drive away from Copley Square and other Boston sights. I'd definitely stay here again."
315982,2646740,2012-10-18,1989010,Georges,Cette maison est très agréable et bien situé pour visiter Boston. Le T Red line est à 5mn. Le restaurant vietnamien au bout de la Park street est un régal. Pour situer Park street sur GPS il faut spécifier le code 02122 sinon on est perdu au milieu de nombreuses Park street.
"Maison à recommander . Hermina est charmante et de bons conseils\"",,,,,
315982,2729479,2012-10-27,3629400,Claire,"We were sad to only be at Hermina's place for one night, but it was beautiful and we (5 of us, traveling artists) had a great time!"
315982,2816513,2012-11-05,2795651,Aaron & Anna,"Hermina's place was clean, convenient, and as described.  She was a good communicator and everything you'd hope for in a host!"
315982,3260313,2013-01-04,1820397,Kush,"The house is beautiful and spacious. Me and 9 other friends rented it over winter break and loved it. Its very convenient, clean and well maintained by Hermina."
315982,3496145,2013-02-08,787732,David,"Arrival was a bit disappointing. When we got there the place had not been cleaned from last guest (dishes in dishwasher, bed clearly with other guests sheets on etc). Host arrived shortly after and made efforts to rectify bu the first experience always counts. Location is dicey - out of town a bit and the closest supermarket makes a Walmart store and its traditional occupants look desirable in comparison. Not sure if I would stay here again."
315982,3737564,2013-03-10,4621340,Xiaohan,It was a wonderful house . And Hermina is a really nice lady too~ we stayed there for four days and it was amazing~
315982,3888292,2013-03-25,284099,Lauren And Pete,This was a great place to stay- so close to the train and wonderful restaurants. Even the parking was good.
315982,4324426,2013-04-28,5498716,Sim Yee,A really nice host=)
The house was clean and Hermina even prepared bread and fruits for us,"highly recommended to everyone!!\"",,,,
315982,4383540,2013-05-01,5944588,Michel,"Très bon séjour. Boston est une ville agréable. La maison est spacieuse et fonctionnelle avec tout ce qu il faut, même un lit bébé  . L environnement immédiat n'est pas terrible mais ce n'est pas ce que nous cherchions."
À recommander sans réserves,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
315982,4468719,2013-05-07,1646797,Venisse,The place was amazing! It was exactly how it looked in the pictures and Hermina was very helpful when we first arrived. She made sure that we had enough blanket and towels and wrote down a list of places around the area and Boston that we could go explore. The place was very clean and very comfortable to stay. I would definitely stay here again!
315982,4532197,2013-05-11,5689535,Donna,"This apartment was great! It was very clean, only 1 block to a good market and 2 blocks to the subway into downtown Boston. Hermina was warm, friendly, and helpful. We would certainly stay here again."
315982,5085905,2013-06-11,6157142,Rodrigo,"The place was well kept, nice and spacious. Hermina was accommodating and very helpful. Great stay!"
315982,5110626,2013-06-13,4530811,Sven,Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt n Herminas Appartement sehr genossen. Ideale Lage um Boston und Umgebung zu erkunden. Wir kommen gerne wieder.
315982,5210471,2013-06-18,6222686,Marie-Hélène,"We spent a weekend in Boston at Hermina's house and everything was as described. We really like the freedom of the checkin/checkout as we want, the proximity of the subway and the cleanliness of the house. The house is really close to a police station which is good in a way because you feel safe but one drawback is the noise of police car and horn though it didn't prevent us from sleeping well."
315982,5487786,2013-07-02,6336705,Tyler,"This was a 3-night, 4 day trip to Boston from Toronto for a bachelor party."
Hermina's place was very clean upon arrival and her directions were spot on.  One of the perks that she maybe didn't list on her page was that it was easily two minutes walking to the train stop which gave us access to Fenway,"Harvard and Boston Proper to explore.  Across the street from her place was maybe the best restaurant we had all week at the Blarney Stone.\"",,,,
315982,5908656,2013-07-22,2007060,Jesse,"Great host! Very convenient to get to via public transportation. Clean, and very nice apartment. Has AC! Very clear about directions and logistics. Very helpful in accommodating our group."
315982,6000889,2013-07-26,5906748,Philippe,"Bien que nous soyons arrivés en début de soirée, Hermina nous a indiqué avoir eu un problème de femme de ménage et d'embouteillage, ce qui fait que la maison n'avait pas été nettoyée. Elle s'est démenée pour faire au plus vite possible pendant que nous dinions, mais cela n'a pas permis un nettoyage complet. Nous avons lu d'autres commentaires de type, il faut sûrement un plus d'attention sur ce point."
La maison est sympathique,un peu juste pour 5. Elle est bien située dans un quartier calme avec le commissariat de police comme voisins. Le métro est à deux pas et en 15 min on est à Boston qui vaut vraiment la visite.,,,,
C'était la fin de notre voyage aux US et le plaisir a été plus fort que le désagrément de départ et Hermina est très amicale.,,,,,

315982,6150806,2013-08-01,6685628,Guido,Gute Lage und großes Appartement über 21 Stock.
315982,6512493,2013-08-15,7314797,Jac,"Hermina was an excellent host, returning all emailed questions promptly. She was unfortunately not able to be there during our stay but was very caring. Apt #2 suited our needs perfectly for proximity to supermarket and train station to Boston South Station to see all the main sights Boston City had to offer!! Its also only two stops away from the JFK Museum which was an added bonus! Thanks so much Hermina for a great trip to Boston! You are a very good ambassador for your city!!"
"Jac ;D\"",,,,,
315982,6811702,2013-08-26,6622596,Christian,Very nice House and host. Very good subway connection to the center!
315982,7095636,2013-09-06,7379531,Francisco Jose,Very fine accommodation and Hermina has been very good host.
315982,7433316,2013-09-20,2658617,Jens,Great Location in Boston.
all was clean and friendly,we enjoyed our breakfast outside in the sun :-),,,,
we can highly recommend this place for a stay in Boston.,,,,,
kind regards,"Jens and Friends\"",,,,
315982,8108954,2013-10-16,4861108,Eric,"Hermina was very friendly, helpful and kind and the accommodation we rented from her was indeed very spacious and well equipped. We had a few issues regarding cleanliness which she acknowledged and tried to help with in the circumstances. Dorchester, the neighborhood, is however not the best area (quite run down) and we did not feel very safe on the streets, despite the police station next door. On the plus side, her home was very close to the 'T' station for travelling quickly into the centre of Boston. A good place for families to stay who don't mind noise, but not for people who are looking for quiet accommodation, especially as different sections of the house are rented out to other Airbnb guests simultaneously!"
315982,8249564,2013-10-22,7062925,Chris,"Hermina was great,. We liked the townhouse, and the price. It was clean and cozy. I do want to mention that the wireless internet was very spotty, so we were mostly unable to use the internet. Also, the heat in the house was broken for a while but Hermina had a repairman out to fix it quickly, and provided us with a space heater in the mean time. We always felt save but a lot of people did mention to us that this wasn't the safest neighborhood. The bedrooms can be a bit noisy at night because the windows open up to the parking lot of a police station. Overall we liked the house and Hermina was very nice."
315982,8620999,2013-11-09,7485963,Rory,"The apartment was clean, spacious and had all of the advertized amenities. We truly enjoyed our stay and would recommend staying here if you need a place close to town."
315982,9391099,2013-12-26,7195682,Olivier,"Hermina house is so nice and not to far from Boston center  . We were 6 , and i was afraid to be a little bit small but finally  the bedrooms are large and living room  room very confortable .  We ´ve not met Hermina but Donna her helper was really friendly with us ."
"I recommend this place . \"",,,,,
315982,10967416,2014-03-15,12427113,Allen,"Perfect, actually.  We needed to get to various locations in the city, so having a place somewhat central was key.  Not to mention, being in the heart of some great Vietnamese restaurants was a bonus.  Hermina made sure that all of our needs were met.  Strongly recommend."
315982,11883954,2014-04-18,1294511,Tim,"Great place that perfectly met our needs-- we were a big group needing an affordable place close to public transit. Beds were comfortable and place was nice and clean. We didn't get a chance to meet Hermina, but her manager was nice and helpful. Thanks!"
315982,13481496,2014-05-28,14927284,Clare,"A very convenient, spacious and quiet spot with easy access to the Red Line and lots of great Vietnamese restaurants. We had a great stay and highly recommend!"
"\"",,,,,
315982,14825705,2014-06-27,11721090,Stevie,"Our experience here was amazing! Hermina wasn't around but her and Donna were very helpful with our questions, and checking up to make sure everything was going well. The neighbourhood is alright, the best thing is that the house is very close to the T and a few shops and restaurants. The house itself is very comfortable, it was just a bit hot in the summer. Also, be aware that the Boston Police are right behind the house, so you're safe but there is a chance of noise late at night. Overall our stay here was very enjoyable, a perfect place to come home to."
315982,15267568,2014-07-06,12080527,Isabelle & Franck,"Très bel appartement, spacieux et très propre."
Peut être un peu loin du centre.,,,,,
"Nous recommandons !\"",,,,,
315982,15883795,2014-07-17,14100237,Nicolas,"The house was great, everything looked just like the pictures and everything was clean and comfortable."
The only thing I would upgrade is the Wifi,"terribly slow.\"",,,,
315982,16046874,2014-07-20,18033751,Sophie,"\"Nous avons été surpris de découvrir qu'on partageait le logement avec d'autres invités, à moins d'avoir mal lu l'offre. Nous étions au sous-sol et une odeur de vieillissement ou d'humidité planait dans l'air. Heureusement que c'était juste pour dormir et préparer une cuisine rapide. On avait pas très bien compris si on pouvait consommer  les produits sur place à part le pain et les fruits où il était mentionné \"\"help yourself\"\" jusqu'à ce qu'une hôte nous le dise. Enfin la maison est propre à l'intérieur mais le quartier est sale"
"\"",,,,,
315982,16472537,2014-07-28,7696047,Lucie,"Pleasant stay in Hermina's house. Rooms were clean and quiet. The house is at two blocs of the subway station, so it will take you 25min to go to the DownTown. The neighborhood is not great but for sleeping it's okay."
Note:,,,,,
Consider asking which appartment you've rent because the house is splitted in two. When we arrived,there were already some people inside. Hermina wasn't here so we called Donna (her house manager) to solve the problem. After several minutes,"we found out that our appartment was behind.\"",,,
315982,16874383,2014-08-03,18932098,Steve,"Realy good stay at this place, but the neighboorhood doesn't look that much safe at night. It was well located at 5 min of the subway station. Clean and nice for the price."
315982,18060171,2014-08-21,15567609,Amitava,Very nice place and the townhouse was very spacious.  The place was also very close to the subway station.  We wish there were more places to eat nearby.
315982,19823776,2014-09-19,2947565,Allie,"Hermina was out of town but her stand in was lovely and very helpful! She had the place perfectly clean for us and we felt super welcomed during our stay. The space is basic and exactly what we needed for our short stay. You are right near a Boston police department so you feel safe! There is also grocery near by which makes it easy to keep your fridge stocked for breakfasts, etc!"
315982,20198634,2014-09-25,20609707,Ritch,"First, the positives, the apartment (we were in Apt. 2), is right next to a police station so you do feel safe.  You are within a five minute walk from the Fields Corner T station and you can be anywhere in Boston in 30 minutes.  You are close to shopping and a very nice restaurant, The Blarney Stone.  Also the beds were comfortable."
Now the negatives,the Dortchester neighborhood is pretty low income,unclean,with half of the storefronts vacant.  It is improving but slowly.  Take a look at the Wiki page for this neighborhood before you rent.  We did,however,feel safe walking around.  The apartment is as pictured
Although we had a great trip to Boston and the apartment was habitable,"we would not recommend.\"",,,,
315982,21867557,2014-10-26,14750285,Boris,"Wir waren zwei Wochen in App#2. Die Ausstattung haben wir genau so vorgefunden wie beschrieben und auf den Fotos zu sehen. Die Lage ist optimal per Auto und per RedLine zu erreichen. Durch die Nachbarschaft der Polizeiwache haben wir uns sehr sicher gefühlt. Lärmbelästigung durch Sirenen gibt es eindeutig nicht. In dem Haus werden zwei App vermietet, wir waren mit Kind da, unsere wechselnden Nachbarn ebenso. Das Haus ist sehr hellhörig, wer mit Kindern und deren Geräuschen ein Problem hat, bleibt besser fern. Wer Kinder hat ist hier gut aufgehoben. An Spielzeug und Kinderausstattung denken - dies ist nicht beworben bzw. beschrieben und somit auch nicht vorhanden."
Das App. war sauber,die Bettwäsche und Handtücher hinreichend und frisch gewaschen vorhanden. Hermina stattet die Küche sogar mit Gewürzen,Pasta,Saucen etc. aus. Das Geschirr war mehr als hinreichend vorhanden und alles sehr sauber. Alle Elektrogeräte (Mikrowelle,Kaffeem.,Fernseher
Hermina ist eine tolle,freundliche und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Sie hat sich von Ankunft bis Abreise um uns gekümmert und ist dabei stets diskret geblieben,was uns sehr gut gefallen hat.,,,
"Wir war insgesamt stets sehr zufrieden.\"",,,,,
315982,22136186,2014-10-31,14002593,Henry,"Hermina nous a fourni toutes les indications pour se rendre facilement à l'appartement, elle n'était pas là pour nous accueillir compte tenu de notre arrivée tardive mais nos l'avons vu le lendemain. L'appartement est propre et dispose de tout le nécessaire pour y vivre confortablement. Le quartier n'est pas le plus beau de Boston mais le métro est seulement à 5 min à pied pour vous rendre dans le centre de Boston en moins de 20 min. l'environnement est plutôt calme et sécurisant avec le poste de police à 10 mètres."
315982,22950048,2014-11-18,11971807,Mark,"Before we arrived we got a document that had all required information on it, which was very helpful."
The house itself was  nice and clean with very good beds and two restrooms. It is very close to the red line T station and a grocery store. There is also a nice place to eat nearby (the Blarney Stone). If you don't mind to go to downtown Boston by T than it is a very good place to stay. We enjoyed it.,,,,,
"You can also rent her car if you want which is nice if you want to go out for a day.\"",,,,,
315982,28984769,2015-04-02,25883328,Julia,"I really like Boston and Hermina's house. We had a great time at Hermina's house. Hermina is a great host. The house is so beautiful, comfortable and convenient. Because Hermina and her house we don't want to leave Boston.  I would certainly recommend Hermina's house. Thanks Hermina :)"
315982,35429538,2015-06-18,7453426,Ben,We had a really great stay at Hermina's place. Everything was arranged immaculately by her in advance and it was a great property in a nice quiet neighbourhood very closely located to the train to the city- which was only a short trip.
Hermina helped us with everything we needed and even checked up on us occasionally.,,,,,
"I would definitely recommend staying here. \"",,,,,
315982,35620915,2015-06-20,30732403,Gabriel,"Hermina gave very elaborate direction for most information and helped us parking my car. In addition, there are enough appliance that can satisfy our need. She is very nice, and the house is also good."
315982,35956191,2015-06-23,22508457,Charles,"Hermina provided great directions and instructions.  She was not there when we arrived, but made a point to introduce herself when she saw us returning to the house in the afternoon.  The accommodations were just as described and pictured."
315982,38883327,2015-07-19,35849369,Beda,"Hermina welcomed us upon our arrival at her house. We enjoyed a nice stay of four nights there and were thus able to explore Boston and its surroundings, partially thanks to her suggestions."
Dorchester suburb,where her house is located,features plenty affordable restaurants and shops. The rooms at Hermina's place were well kept and at a walking distance from Fields Corner station,where the subway takes you to downtown Boston within a couple of minutes. Boston itself delighted us with its range of activities on offer: Visit one of its museums (e.g. Harvard's Art Museums),dive into history on the Freedom Trail,"or take the boat to nearby Cape Cod for a relaxing day off.\""
315982,39395597,2015-07-23,34125729,Micheal,"Hermina's place was perfect for our stay in Boston. It's just 3-4 minute walk away from the train/subway station, which will have you in Downtown Boston in 15 minutes. There were plenty of places to eat in the locality, and with a police station right behind the house, it couldn't have been any safer! Hermina was always easily contactable if we had any questions and made us feel right at home. I'd definitely recommend the place to anyone intending to visit Boston."
315982,44133838,2015-08-24,36638438,Jan,"Leider haben wir Hermina nicht persönlich kennengelernt. Auch die Housekeeperin Donna hat uns lediglich einen Zettel geschrieben. Die Unterkunft war wie beschrieben, ein Zimmer mit Doppelbett, eines mit riesigem Doppelbett. Ein Zimmer mit Schlafsofa und angrenzendem Wohnbereich. Die Entfernung zur U-Bahn ist nur wenige Minuten, es sind nur ein paar Stationen zum Zentrum. Was uns nicht gefallen hat: es waren diverse angefangen und teilweise schlecht gewordene Lebensmittel im Kühlschrank. Obwohl wir für fünf Personen gebucht haben, lagen nur 4 Handtücher bereit."
315982,45828948,2015-09-06,31979620,Paula,"I did not meet Hermina but other family members did.  Hermina's place was easy to find and plenty roomy for the five of us. Shopping and restaurants were just down the street, and the T was a quick 2 block walk away. It's a diverse neighborhood but people were friendly and we felt safe. Having a full kitchen was convenient and we ate in for most meals."
Parking was difficult: there was only room for one car in the drive and street parking was restricted to certain days and times.,,,,,
There was a portable A/C downstairs,but it would have been better used in the upstairs bedroom; there was a cross-breeze in the living/ kitchen area but the bedrooms were stuffy.,,,,
It was distressing that the trash and used linens from the previous occupants had not been cleaned up,since there is a cleaning fee automatically included in the price,"yet the B and B rules ask guests to strip the beds and remove trash.\"",,,
315982,46382893,2015-09-10,38527851,Juan Ramon,"La situación de la casa es perfecta, a pocos pasos de una estación de metro, y con mucha tranquilidad a todas horas."
La casa está perfectamente equipada y muy limpia. Las camas son perfectas.,,,,,
Hermina es una gran anfitriona y le damos las gracias por sus atenciones.,,,,,
"Boston es una ciudad que merece la pena visitar.\"",,,,,
315982,47661540,2015-09-21,38470737,Kalun,"I rent this place to stay, and do a family gathering for a lunch. I did not clearly state that at my reservation which is my bad. The host was kind enough to let our gathering continue."
The host leaves some useful information around about the city which is good. The living room and kitchen area has a portable AC,and only one bedroom has a window AC. In a hot day,it is not enough. The portable AC leaves water on the floor as well.,,,

We only stayed in the apartment during the night and the apartment had a quiet neighborhood. Besides, the price is very reasonable and Hermina is a great host too. Whenever we had questions or problems, she would help us as soon as possible. In all, it is a great place to stay."
315982,68727080,2016-04-06,58517105,Natalie,Nice home. Everything is accurate as seen in pictures. The best part is the location which is very near the T station that can take you to any place within boston. My friend and I felt uncomfortable with the neighborhood though. Not recommended for single girl traveler.
315982,69338977,2016-04-10,14098753,Jingying,Good stay. Thx to the kind host.
315982,71362106,2016-04-24,1393714,Pierre-Marc,We had a great experience with Hermina.
She provided all the information we needed for a smooth check-in. Our party messed up a bit on arrival due to entering the wrong lodging but it was resolved quickly by Hermina. If we had read the information she provided more carefully we could have avoided that anyway.,,,,,
Hermina went out of her way to help us with our set up; visiting us to make sure we had plenty of sheets and blankets or had any other needs.,,,,,

Es una lastima que no haya tenido la oportunidad de conocer a Hermina,pero siempre estuvo al pendiente de nosotros por teléfono o mensajes.,,,,
En nuestro caso salíamos muy temprano de la casa y regresábamos solo a dormir,pero todo es tal cual se anuncia y en una zona muy segura,ya que a lado de la casa hay un tipo de estación de policía.,,,

The localization of the house is perfect and really convenient to visit Boston. Moreover, if you have a car it is really easy and free to park, which is nice. A very nice AirBnB experience again! Thanks a lot Hermina"
315982,87927517,2016-07-22,67589795,Oliver,Everthing was fine. Good to find - by car or by train.  We were coming late - that wasn't a problem.

Apartment was clean and spacious, with a Bostonian feel. There was ample room for 1 bedroom plus a couch in the living room. Mario was very accommodating as we needed extended checkout time and was super responsive. He also had great suggestions on day trips outside of Boston. Overall, would recommend the apartment to stay for the future!"

716643,2785596,2012-11-02,3644541,Leanne,"The apartment we had was nicely furnished, had everything we needed and was in a perfect location next to prudential t station ... However it was not the apartment named here (which we expected). We stayed at 32 garrison street, apt 40-106. I can't fault it - towels etc were included. Excellent kitchen. My only slight issue was that there were no curtains in the bedrooms so it was very bright in the mornings. You could also faintly hear the trains running past. The concierge was really friendly and helpful. I just can't understand why we were given a different apartment with no explanation! However the apartment we had was excellent and I would definitely stay again."
716643,2844893,2012-11-09,3417082,Tressa,"The apartment was nice, clean and had everything you would need. Only issue really is that there are 3 different organizations you have to work with once you book this place. Seamless on Airbnb, Churchill properties who owns(?) the place, and then directly with the apartment complex. So, once you book with Seamless, you have to call Churchill for all your needs, but once you are in the apartment, you have to talk to the concierge. Everyone was nice and helpful, i just didn't anticipate this and it became quite a hassle to set up parking when i got there (even though i called 3 days before arrival to try to set it up)."
Otherwise,centrally located,"right near the Prudential center and Copley square. Easy to get around on foot and you can't beat the price for the area.\"",,,
716643,3391515,2013-01-22,3759024,Maureen,"We had a fabulous, clean two bedroom, one and a half bath apartment with a living area, dining area and kitchen. In case we forgot anything complimentary toiletries were a welcoming sight. If there is a down side to our stay, finding the key location and the location of the apartment was an adventure. Our entire stay was during a time that no concierge was on duty. It is very convenient to the Prudential Center and Copley Plaza as well."
716643,3756670,2013-03-11,5175298,Russell,"Everyone at Seamless Transition was fantastic and immensely helpful in supplying us with a wonderful (and at the last minute!) residence just a short walk away from the Hynes Convention Center.  The only way our visit became possible was a result of their immediate service and professionalism, and a personal sweetness that made everything else, well... pleasantly seamless."
716643,5102155,2013-06-12,6074660,Anna,"This place was a pleasure to stay at and ideally located near the Boston Common, public transportation, and many sites in Boston. We really made a home here while we were in Boston  - the place was well equipped, clean, and the concierge was very helpful. Seamless Transition was easy to work with and we would book with them again. My only complaint was that the second bedroom had a single bed - we made do, but it would have been nice to have a double bed in the second bedroom because we had two couples."
716643,18532954,2014-08-28,16941357,Ramma,"all check in instructions were perfect. It helped arriving during day light hours when the concierge was around, thereby assisting us with apartment location within the blocks and helping with baggage etc. The neighbourhood is beautiful and very convenient. The apartment was spotless and just as described. Will definitely stay here again."

However, we had some issues with the listing, as we booked a private room and one of our party of 3 ended up sleeping on the couch in the living room."
13126713,81135479,2016-06-21,69816372,Donald,"Rachid was a great host and my stay in his home was very nice and worked out well for me.  I was in town for a conference and I had initially booked a reservation with someone else though Airbnb (my first experience!), but that fell through at the last moment and I was left without a place to stay when I arrived in Boston. Luckily, Rachid took me in. He is extremely friendly and gracious. His home is new and very nice and clean. I had a bright large room that was simply furnished and more than adequate. I had  access to the kitchen, which seemed to be well equipped, and while I did not cook or eat there I was invited to do so. The bathrooms (2 shared) were clean and everything was new. The immediate neighborhood is residential - nicely kept up and seemed very safe. Rachid made my stay very pleasant - he is very friendly and interesting, and has a good sense of humor. He treated me like family. I enjoyed my stay."

Amazing location!,,,,,
Wow! I really didn't realize how perfectly situated this place was: 2 blocks from Fenway Park and closer to the Hynes Convention Center than most of the hotels! Beautiful park right out the front door.,,,,,

39116,113405,2010-10-07,185493,Pauline,My husband & I had a great stay with Angela and Nevada.  As first time visitors to Boston we found the train system was handy and also Fenway Park (both 5 minutes walk from apartment) with property situated in a quiet area of the city.  The park directly across from the apartment is handy if you are keen for an early morning jog - approx 3km around park - felt safe jogging on my own.  Would recommend & also stay again if ever in the area again.  Angela is a very accommodationg host and happy to share her knowledge and experiences of the area to you - thanks Angela.

Clean, comfortable, and convenient, the room and apartment had everything I needed.  More importantly, Angie was the best host imaginable - friendly, full of helpful local information, and generous with her time, not to mention smart, funny, interesting, and just a wonderful person in every way.  And Nevada is the sweetest dog!  I hope this glowing review doesn't mean her place will be booked out in future, because I would love to stay with her on my regularly scheduled visits to Boston over the next 2 years.

Her dog, Nevada, and her friends' dog who she was sitting for as well, were both very sweet and a nice addition to the scene for a dog-lover like me!"
The room is very nice,albeit quite small. And it's on the first floor,so you do hear what's going on on the street and sidewalk. That said,the bed was quite comfortable and I slept very well. The shared bathroom was large and very clean (as was the whole apartment).,,
I didn't make myself any breakfast (other than taking a few bananas and apples which were generously provided),but Angela made sure I knew that cooking up some eggs (or helping myself to whatever else was in the larder) was an option.,,,,
It's a lovely neighborhood and very pretty spot right on the park. And if you haven't ever seen the Gardner Museum or the MFA,they're both awesome and right out your doorstep,as is Northeastern University,"where I was attending a conference.\"",,

The bedroom is small but cheery and she allowed us use of the living room as well.  The location is great for those wishing to take in a game at Fenway and there is a lovely park/greenway across the street.  The only drawback is that the parking here is very dicey, as it is in most large cities.  Everything nearby is a tow-away zone and we had to park in a garage ($55/day) three blocks away.  Otherwise a great location and a great host - we recommend this room highly!"

39116,15879010,2014-07-17,10894020,Timothy,"I was in BeanTown for an event at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and selected this location for proximity to that institution. I also found it terrific for jogging among the Fens across the street, close proximity to the T.  Host was responsive with emails, logistical inquiries, and delightful in every way and makes you feel right at home immediately upon arrival.    Bedroom was clean and tidy--if a bit diminutive. The Airbnb spirit of come and go as a seasoned room mate was the mantra here."

It is right across the street from Fenway Park and within walking distance from plenty of restaurants or bars. Nevada is sweetheart. She'll take a pet if you offer and if not she will keep to herself. This was my first time using airbnb and it was a positive experience; I would definitely use it again.

The room and the apartment in general are very nice and the bed is extremely comfortable. I slept very well there. The only thing that one has to consider is that your clothes might smell like dog. At least this was the case for me and I stayed 5 nights.

I had everything I needed and Hochiang, Josh and Andrew went above and beyond to make me feel at happy and at home, with enormous success. I actually felt a little homesick when I left."
13531200,91464170,2016-08-05,81194558,Carin,"Hochiang was very responsive, kind, and accommodating.  I was touched by his kindness and extremely fast responsiveness to my needs and difficult schedule.  He made me feel welcome and taken care of."
The place itself is very well organized.  It's the little things.  He has a small stand with information on Boston,sight seeing,etc.,you can lock your room,and the living room is a cute place to work.,
It's ~5 min away from Harvard Medical School and the hospitals,so for anyone interviewing for medical/residency programs,it's incredibly convenient and accessible.  The room itself is clean,and there's a clean towel for use.  I visited during the hot summer,so I was very thankful there was an AC in the room.,

They could not have been more helpful or accommodating and were very responsive to any questions I had. I stayed with two friends and we found the apartment very comfortable for the three of us, and definitely as \"\"charming\"\" as the description and pictures suggest. Everything went smoothly - accessing the apartment"
8480507,55295085,2015-11-29,39956124,Marianne,"My partner and I traveled up to Boston (a city we know very well) for Thanksgiving. It was super easy to book and Kyle & Kelsey were very helpful in helping us plan for parking and in suggesting where to take our dog for walks. The neighborhood is very safe, the building is clean and quiet. I especially loved the large deck (the photo doesn't do the size justice)."
The apartment was immaculately clean and we especially loved the style of the place. It felt like we were in an upscale hotel. The kitchen was a lot of fun as well since I really enjoy cooking it was a thrill to use it.,,,,,
We would definitely book this place again (if available) for another trip to Boston. It's just off a main street and so it's easy to get to anywhere in Boston / Cambridge,in addition to being by several public transport stops. Very convenient. Enjoyed ourselves immensely. Thanks,"Kyle & Kelsey!\"",,,

8480507,58411708,2016-01-02,16151061,Liz,"Kyle and Kelsey's home is one of the most beautiful apartments I've ever had the pleasure of staying in. The location is fantastic, very close to the Broadway and Mass ave T stops (a couple of blocks) and a short walk to the Common / Copley, in a beautifully renovated brownstone. Entry was very easy (via lockbox) and they were very flexible on timing."
The apartment itself is absolutely spotless and sports a beautiful,spacious deck with 180 degree views. I also liked how there are 1.5 bathrooms - I believe it's called a Jack and Jill,with two toilets,which is very convenient for getting ready while others are showering.,,
The kitchen is also fully furnished and we appreciated our hosts' allowing us to use it for our brunch!,,,,,
"Absolutely recommend.\"",,,,,
8480507,68636301,2016-04-05,14135177,Anna,Gorgeous apartment with super easy parking! Kyle and Kelsey are wonderful and helpful hosts!
8480507,69578767,2016-04-11,54910061,Rebecca,"Kyle and Kelsey were great.  I booked their apartment to use as the main set as my BA Capstone film project at school and they were very open to the idea from the beginning, allowing us to arrange for an early check-in and late check-out time to accommodate our tight shooting schedule.  Overall fantastic."
8480507,70580823,2016-04-18,61008016,John,"As great as the listing description was, the experience was even better! Kyle and Kelsey had everything in place for us and answered the questions we had as fast as we could ask them. Incredible apartment and great location - we were in town for the marathon. Their recommendations, everything from dining out to where to park, were spot on. Without a doubt I know where we will be staying the next time we are in Boston!"
8480507,74438461,2016-05-15,58233217,Sue,"Kyle and Kelsey's place was fabulous! As a cook, the kitchen was a dream to cook in and they had every perfect pot, pan and utensil. It fit 4 of us perfectly and having the two toilets was a big help.  Only wish that our weather had been better to really use the deck."
One thing to note with this apartment,the steps leading up to the place are very steep.  It was fine for me,but for older folks (my mother who is 85) they were a little difficult.,,,
I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and everyone and use it again and again!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
8480507,77286370,2016-05-31,663587,Brendon,"Kyle & Kelsey's place was beautiful and just the thing for a weekend getaway. It's conveniently located close to public transit and even within walking distance of some attractions (walking to the Prudential Center took less than 20 minutes, for instance), and there are some great restaurants nearby. Inside, it's beautifully designed and comfortable, with the deck being the real piece de resistance. Our hosts gave us complete privacy yet responded to a few questions that we had nearly instantly. We would (and probably will) definitely stay there again."
8480507,78186779,2016-06-05,8072146,Henry,"We were visiting Boston for our college alumni weekend and could not have asked for a more perfect to stay in. The description provided is incredibly accurate. The apartment is beautiful and spacious with a large outdoor deck. We were welcomed with a little gift from the hosts, which added a nice touch to the beginning of our weekend. This is a perfect apartment for up to 4 guests. It is centrally located and easy walking distance to pretty much any area in Boston. I would highly recommend booking this apartment because of not only the space, but the awesome hosts!"

Thank you to our hosts for making our stay at your place another great Boston memory! Will be back!"
8480507,84149678,2016-07-05,9717914,Vicki,"Kyle and Kelsey's place was absolutely gorgeous, clean and comfortable! They were able to be flexible with our arrival time, which ended up being very helpful since we hit some traffic on the way up from NYC. They were easily accessible via text message when we needed them, and had left everything in order for us when we arrived. We were three people, and the layout of the apartment was perfect for us with the two toilets. The location was good--walking distance to public transportation. We had no problems finding free street parking in the surrounding blocks, despite it being 4th of July weekend. The terrace was wonderful as well--wish I had one like that in our own place! Highly recommended. We missed the comforts of home their place offered when we stayed in hotels on other stops during our trip!"
8480507,88531250,2016-07-24,21928933,Patricia,"We had a wonderful time at Kyle and Kelsey's beautiful home. It had everything you could want to feel you were part of the city: great architecture with the traditional Brownstone style, modern comforts of the remodeled kitchen and bathrooms, location location location with the ease of walking or short transit to all you'd want to see. We visited several of Kelsey's recommended restaurants in the neighborhood and had great experiences in them all. The weather was very hot and humid when we were there but the apartment was cool and quiet. When a storm came in and cooled down the evening their deck was an oasis to enjoy the sites and sounds of the city. We would definitely recommend this stay and hope to return ourselves in the future. We also thank them for being flexible as we arrived a little earlier than expected. Communication was easy and quick."
8480507,96158058,2016-08-22,30388902,James,"Beautiful apartment with a nice convenient location in South End near plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, and metro stops nearby. Street parking in front of the apartment was incredibly convenient, as well."

Beyond its spaciousness,far and away the biggest asset of the apartment is its location.  You really can't get any better than this.  Once we arrived and parked our car we didn't move it the entire time we were there.  We were able to walk to all the major sites of Boston and had a great time exploring the beautiful and historic neighborhood of Beacon Hill.,,,,
Logistically,everything was very smooth.  The owner was very responsive to emails prior to us arriving and picking up and dropping off the keys was very easy.  The place was clean and had all the basic supplies we needed to make it through the week.,,,,
This place is a gem.  You'll feel like you are living in a dream world.  Book it!,,,,,

The location was perfect, we walked everywhere as weather was stunning. The house was perfectly laid out with interesting artwork and artifacts! Our kids loved the piano, hope the neighbors loved their music! It really felt like we were a part of the Beacon Hill set! Only one very small issue which did not spoil our stay, could be a bit cleaner! Thank you peter and family, we hope to return!"
3351728,17216263,2014-08-09,17156202,Joseph,This home exceeded my expectations.  A beautiful home in a beautiful neighborhood.  I've made many trips to Boston this year for work but never really got the chance to explore since I stayed in hotels less than a mile from work.  I had an opportunity to stay two weeks including a weekend this trip.  This home's location was a perfect hub to explore from.  I felt like I finally had a true Boston experience during this stay.
Besides being in a perfect location,the home itself is amazing!  I had employees in town from out of country staying with me for the two weeks.  My family also came up for part of it.  The house was plenty big for all of us with 5 bedrooms,3 full bathrooms,large living areas,etc.  It was very clean upon arrival.  We had a printout from Peter with details on the house and suggestions for places to go in the neighborhood.  Communication with Peter before,during and after the stay was easy.
The park across the street was a relaxing place to visit and had free events going on almost everyday during my stay.  I felt very safe wandering around the neighborhood and park at night.  I couldn't ask for anything better for this trip.,,,,,
Thank you so much Peter.  I hope we can make a similar arrangement again in the future.,,,,,

3351728,37311161,2015-07-06,31937108,Suzy,"Wow! ! ! The most amazing home in the most spectacular city on the most stunning block. Peter opened up his family home to us and we felt so very special. The family lives a wonderful life here and it is evidenced by this cozy, glorious space. The energy and love in this place made our stay even better. Location was amazing. Peter left a guide with great local tips. We got in shape by walking up the various three flights of stairs pending on which of the floors  we were visiting and our family of 8 could all stay under one roof. Family breakfasts and dinners afforded more bonding time that a hotel just couldn't. Worth every penny for numerous reasons. Thank you so much for sharing your very special home with us. We will never forget this week. Hopefully we can return again one day. With aloha, Suzy."
3351728,39631139,2015-07-25,34911804,Tracy,"We just returned from a fantastic trip to the northeast and our time at this beautiful Beacon Hill town house was the best part of our stay. The location was unbeatable, within walking distance of everything we wanted to see; and the city guide that Peter left helped us hit the high points of Boston and all the wonderful treasures in Beacon Hill."
The space itself was so warm and welcoming with a well-equipped kitchen,a wonderful game room for our sons,room enough for our family of 4 to spend time all together or apart and a priceless view of the Public Garden. The property was beyond everything described in the listing  - we couldn't have asked for anything more.,,,
Thank you so much for sharing your special home with us,"we hope to return!\"",,,,

3351728,43658945,2015-08-21,4448946,Alexander,"Check in was really easy. Location is awesome, right across the park. Starbucks is few steps away + a lot of places for brunch."
I've been traveling a lot and I can see that airbnb became just a hotel service. I mean every time I book an apt I can say that people don't live there,"rather than just give for rent. This one was completely (URL HIDDEN) feels like home. Me and my wife liked it a lot! It's huge and beautiful mansion with creative design. I would totally recommend this place for everyone and especially for families with kids.\"",,,,
3351728,44885932,2015-08-30,23784201,Jean Marc,"A genuine home that has the charm to generate very happy moments. A gem of peace in a beautiful city, at the middle of everything, in front of the common and the park. The house is beautiful outside and inside its lots of space for relaxation and coming together. Peter was a fantastic host, extremely responsive but never invasive. The home guide was complete and useful. Thank you for sharing your home with us"
3351728,88797484,2016-07-25,76286355,Lorrie,"\"Stayed here with two adults and four teens.  The perfect place to stay - first all because of location.  Right across the street from Boston Common and Boston Public Garden.  Around the corner, on Charles Street, there is a Starbuck's, a market, a couple pizzerias/Italian food, and other small restaurants and a great ice scream shop (JP Licks - we visited every night!) On the other side of Boston Common/Public Park, you can find chain restaurants (PF Changs, Legal Seafood, Rockbottom, Maggiano's) all within walking distance.  And the \"\"Cheer's\"\" bar/restaurant is practically next door.  The accommodations were perfect.  Five bedrooms and 3 bathrooms were perfect for us. Each of the kids had their own bedroom.  The 3 bathrooms made it easy to get ready each day.  The game room with large TV and games were a hit with the kids.  Another large TV for my husband and I to watch.  Full kitchen access with plenty of dishes and silverware.  I made dinner one night and had everything I needed....pots"
I can't say enough how much we enjoyed our stay here.  Again,the location is perfect,you can start the Freedom Trail in Boston Common.  All of the sites are within 1 mile....some a little further and we used Uber for those.  On the day we left,our flight was not until 6pm and Peter was nice enough to let us leave our luggage in the entryway until our trip to the airport.,,
My only warning if you plan to rent this home is to know there are 3 sets of narrow stairways you must access ( I never had to go to the third floor....that was where all the teens' bedrooms were....but I did have to access two sets of stairs daily).  An older person may have difficulty accessing these.  We had no problems but thought had I brought my in laws on this trip,they would not have been able to go up and down the stairs.,,,,
Other than that,this is a great place to stay while in Boston.  Location and accommodations perfect!   Peter,"thanks for sharing your home with us!\"",,,

The location is perfect in a beautiful historic neighborhood and had great access to multiple subway stops.  We loved the contemporary upscale furniture and decor and the amenities were fantastic, especially the gorgeous kitchen island with plenty of room to eat and chat and the easy access from the keypad door lock.

11906382,70279532,2016-04-17,6529276,Jennifer,Jaysa is the perfect host! Our arrival could not have been easier.
Simply gorgeous! We would almost prefer not to write a review just so that this could remain our secret getaway. The apt is spacious,luxurious and perfect for those who are looking for a gourmet kitchen and place to linger in the evening after a day walking around Boston. The contemporary design is as pictured only nicer. Beacon Hill,with it's cobblestone streets is the ideal location,walking distance to the Charles River promenade,the Boston Common,Faneuil Hall
As Airbnb rentals go,"this one is a gem. We will definitely return!\"",,,,
11906382,82137135,2016-06-26,22781876,Diana,"From the moment I read the detailed and honest description of the place I knew I'd book. Jaysa's explanation and information about the apt and access were very meticulous and explicit, which helped with getting access and planning. The location is the best in Boston as Beacon Hill is near all major attractions and transportation, and although, the apt is in the middle of all attractions, this is still secluded and quiet. The street and brownstone building have that amazing historic feeling that's sure to impress. The apartment itself is immaculate and in person, it's even better than the pictures. Moreover, it has a full kitchen and everything requires to stay comfortably. Restaurants, shops, supermarkets and key historical landmarks are within walking distance. The decoration and cleanliness surpassed my expectations. To me this is the best place I've stayed in with Airbnb so far!"
11906382,83949116,2016-07-04,49721043,Angela,"Jaysa was super responsive and nice.  She left amazing detailed information about everything you could possibly need to know or  use or find at the condo. Any questions that you have about the stay she will respond super fast! The condo is gorgeous and in a great area with Starbucks, Whole Foods and other restaurants walking distance and you are  quick cab or uber from many places!!! My first time to Boston was great and I would definitely stay here again on a future visit!"
11906382,92395696,2016-08-08,85386223,Jose,Jaysa's apartment is located in a quiet and safe residential area only 12 minutes from the airport.  There are grocery stores and restaurants just a few blocks away.

3678429,16878424,2014-08-03,19232296,Chen,A great experience as my first Airbnb trip. I got great welcome when I arrived. The house is very clean and modern. They even has a gym room inside the house. The neighborhood is quite. Stacey is a very kind and reliable host.
3678429,17080914,2014-08-06,17413505,Sun,"Stacey was a very friendly and wonderful host. I stay in the living room with sofa bed, it was 'really' comfortable (it was almost same as other full size of a 'real' bed, so you don’t have to worry about it). The house was always kept clean. Stacey offers you a great meal (by extra 5 dollars /each meal). She is an excellent cook. I highly recommend to taste her food. Moreover, there were lovely and friendly cats in her house. Lastly, she had served U.S.A.F. at outside of the USA, so she has a wealth of experience with foreign culture and people. Her house is recommendable to international travelers, too."
3678429,18213808,2014-08-23,19514475,Andrew,"As a first Airbnb experience, there was not much more I could ask for. The place was kept very clean and the sofa bed was as comfy as a normal bed. The $5 meals are probably the best meal you can go for in Boston because it's delicious, relatively cheap and it will fill you up. The location is not too far from a subway station. Highly recommended!"
3678429,19398442,2014-09-11,20983121,Sireesh,This is my first experience with Airbnb. It has been wonderful experience and Thank you very much Stacey for hosting me. I really liked room and just enough for what I was looking for temporary stay. It is very close to public transportation to downtown.
3678429,19824979,2014-09-19,19274711,Tobias,"Stacey was a great, interesting and reliable host and did everything to guarantee a pleasant stay. The bed was very comfortable and her house,  which was very modern and clean, only a few minutes away from the subway station. Her cute little cat was the cherry on top :-). All in all I can strongly recommend Stacey as a host and would always repeat my trip to her."
3678429,21264495,2014-10-13,21804769,Zoe (XI),Stacey is super nice! She picked me up from the subway at night when I just arrived and drove me to the park where I started my half marathon early in the next morning. The sofa bed is very comfortable and just like a real bed. Her roommate is also nice and quite. Thank you so much Stacey!
3678429,30482055,2015-04-22,31398653,Mike,"Good bed, great food and very nice host.  .9 miles from Asmont T Station.  Host like Stacey make Boston accessible for a reasonable price."

Stacey is a very nice host and her cat is such a cut pie:) there's also a very nice place to take a walk or go for a run only about half a mile away from the house. If you were like me, taking a break in Boston on weekends, I would recommend her place."
336960,939051,2012-02-21,445468,Rob,"The guest room is private and has a separate entrance in this very cool and unique home!  The room was comfortable and warm, even in the Boston winter, and Andree was friendly and accommodating!"

336960,979368,2012-03-07,770760,Chris&Stephanie,My stay with Andree was a welcome stop in a week long business trip. The picture and description is very accurate. This is a very nice private room. The location is convenient and it is easily accessible to the train. Andree's place also has street parking which was helpful since I had to rent a car to get around. I cannot thank her enough for being such a fabulous host.
336960,983978,2012-03-09,1540485,Irene,"I stayed 3 nights while attending avconference in  Boston . I enjoyed the room and agree it is well represented in the photos. The shower was very nice and the bathroom sink inspired an impromptu trip to Ikea while I was there. Jamaica PLain is a really nice suburb of Boston, good restaurants, beautiful areas for walking, diverse community. A short drive into Boston, all road in Boston are quite complicated... so that is a given, but not a ccriticism. Andrees' place is a nice example of the new urbanization. My only complaint was not having enough time to talk with her more. Next time !   I will definitely be back and am telling all my friends about it."
336960,998277,2012-03-13,1149035,Geraldine,"Mapquest gave very confusing directions so we spend more than 1hr driving around and around looking for the right turnoff, turning around, driving back and going through the route again and again. Made it extremely difficult to get a good night of zzzzs because we were so fried from Mapquest's confusing directions."
Once there,"it was a pleasant evening. Like their minimalist architecture. We basically spent the night and left early in the morning.\"",,,,

Her place is about a mile away from the subway and a 10 minute walk to the main road."

336960,1271205,2012-05-13,442403,Jessica,"Our stay at Andree's was wonderful. We were in town only a few days, but the place was lovely, easy to get to, and Andree accommodated our late arrival. The neighborhood is charming and easy to access by public transit, as we did not have a car. This was our first AirBnB experience, and it was definitely a good one. We'll definitely be back next time we're in town!"
336960,1335827,2012-05-23,2148509,Jesse,"We enjoyed staying at Andree's place.  We chose Andree's place mainly because of the green house feature, and we are more impressed how wonderful Andree is as a host.  Andree made arrangements to ensure all my family are comfortable for our stay.  The private room and bath are  spacious and clean, and very kids friendly.  The wi-fi is great.  The neighborhood is nice and friendly.  20 min walk to T station, but 5 min walk to closest bus stop.

Parking is very convenient and abundant if you choice to drive to and around Boston."
336960,1497452,2012-06-17,2282621,Rhiannon,I stayed with Andree for a week to visit a lab at Arnold Arboretum.

I would definitely stay with her again.

Guests staying in the summer should be prepared for sleeping in a warm room as there is no AC, as one would expect in an eco-friendly accommodation. WiFi is strong and dependable. Neighborhood is lovely! Friendly neighbors greet you as you walk to the train station about 3/4 mile away. Plenty of street parking for your vehicle.

As new comers in the town,the first weeks seemed especially challenging as we had a lot of details to go through,documents,grocery,preschool,etc. Whenever we had a problem/question
The only pity is,she's got a nice garden out there,with apple and cherry trees,tulips and strawberries,and a lot of vegetables,but because of the season we couldn't see much before we left
The room itself is quite a cozy place,private bath,private entrance,spacious room,shared kitchen. 20 minutes walk to forest hill station,5-10 mins walk to Bus 32 on Hyde Park Avenue and then 10 minutes to the  forest hill station.

336960,4423872,2013-05-04,95260,Bella,"My partner and I stayed with Andree for two nights while we were in Boston. We didn't see much of Andree, but she was always nice and responsive, and left food out for breakfast each day, which we very much appreciated. She also accommodated us on short notice, which was very kind. The room itself was clean and comfortable, and came complete with organic shampoo, soft sheets and a handy hat rack. There were only a couple of drawbacks for us. The first was the location - the house is a twenty-minute walk to the nearest metro station (or a ten-minute walk to a bus that will take you to the metro), and not in close proximity to many restaurants or shops. If you have access to a car, this won't be a problem, but if you don't, it is a bit of a hike to get around and into town. The other was the level of noise in the house in the mornings and evenings - the room is next to the kitchen and Andree and her children live upstairs. There is very little soundproofing in the house, and although Andree kindly provides earplugs in the room, you can still hear every footstep and conversation. This is only a problem in the early mornings on weekdays, when the kids are having breakfast in the kitchen, and after school until about 8pm, when they go to bed - so it depends on your schedule (during the day, when the kids are in school, the house is extremely peaceful!)."
In summary - lovely room and friendly host,but not very convenient for those without a car,"and noise may be an issue for some.\"",,,
336960,4455640,2013-05-06,487791,Kerri,"My boyfriend Scott and I had an amazing time staying at the Green House in JP.  The place is wonderful! We were so happy when we opened the door!  We arrived late, and Andree was leaving town early the next morning with her kids, so we never met.  The place was very quiet and private and delightful!"
336960,4522381,2013-05-10,696230,Ellen,"A lovely, private space in a unique, green home!"
336960,4641702,2013-05-17,1089634,Stuart,"Very nice! Private entrance & bath, comfortable bed, environmentally friendly. Good community, parking at door."
336960,4768475,2013-05-25,5015071,Sarah,My parents had a great stay! Andree is a good host. They were able to use the kitchen which is very helpful. The room is clean and beautiful.
336960,6144875,2013-08-01,4926149,Florian,We were looking for an affordable place to stay for a familly in Boston for two month. We could not have been more lucky than with Andrees JP Green House. It is located quite a bit from the city center but the lively center street in Jamaica plain is near (25min walk) and it is possible to reach whole Boston by bike within half an hour or by public transport (The t-line station is a 15min walk).
The guest room is big and offers a double bed and a bunk bed for a third person. It is furnished so practical that it was no problem for us to fit in two adults and two small children with all our luggage. We could also use the kitchen and the living room at any time.,,,,,
A very big plus,especially for long term stays,are the own bath room with shower and the own entrance! There is also a big garden around the house where the children could play and we could even get home grown vegetables.,,,
Andree was a extremely nice and helpful host. When we arrived,she took us on a orientation tour through Jamaica plain. During the whole stay she had valuable tips for us and found nice toys for the kids. Our 4 years old daughter had a lot of fun with canyon,the most friendly and quiet dog I know.,,,
Andrees two sons are very nice and quiet teenagers. During our stay there were school holidays and they were on vacation most of the time.,,,,,
"All in all it was a great time with Andree and her family. Very highly recommended!\"",,,,,
336960,6433834,2013-08-12,426538,Steven,We had a lovely quick (one night) and comfy stay. Easy parking and a quiet night make for happy guests. Andree was very helpful and pleasant. Thanks!
336960,6490789,2013-08-14,7385579,Owen,"This was our very first Airbnb experience, and we were off to a great start. We were fascinated to meet Andree and learn about what she has done to make her home so energy efficient.  She has created a model of how a home can be totally comfortable while requiring almost no energy to heat or cool, and all very low-tech.  I hope lots of people will have the chance to learn from what she has accomplished.   The location also made a great home base for a trip into Boston, which we thoroughly enjoyed.  And the breakfast was great too.  I happily recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting the Boston area, and also anyone interested in learning more about how a home can be really energy efficient."
336960,6528199,2013-08-16,5071497,Sara,"Very good stay, unfortunately too short (only two nights). The house is special and eco-friendly, the room was enough clean and everything was as we expected. Positive aspects: large and bright room, private entrance, good, healthy biological breakfast, organic soaps, large shower stall. Negative aspects: very small washbasin. Andree is a good host, she was very helpful and kind. The neighborhood is very nice and quite, a little bit far from downtown Boston but no problem to reach it by bus, metro or car. Thank you Andree, I would suggest your peculiar house to everyone!"
336960,6873577,2013-08-28,1089634,Stuart,"Andree is a lovely hostess with nice, comfortable, clean accommodations, in a good location. Easy, free, on-street parking at the door."
336960,6987706,2013-09-02,7537176,Allison,The JP Green House was perfect for us! Andree was a great host as well. She was flexible with the fact that our flight got in a little late. When we first arrived the hot water wasn't working but she got a mechanic over the next day and even refunded us some of the cost.  The house is right across from a beautiful cemetery and in such a lovely neighborhood (perfect place to stroll around or go for a run). The train is a short walk away and will take you right into the hub of the city. The room had a futon bed which I was a little hesitant about at first but it turned out to be very comfortable and plenty spacious. The only downside is that it got a little stuffy in the room but then we were visiting on some of the hottest days/nights. Overall it was a great experience!
336960,7741308,2013-10-01,7974788,Mark,"Had a really great time staying at the Greenhouse. Andree has created a very unique, cool space that's full of energy."
Staying there was a treat. We were using the T almost always,and it was a ~20 min walk to get there,but most of it is through very nice residential areas of JP.,,,
Andree's two sons are also quite charming,and it was always fun to run into them. They also take obvious care to be quiet in the mornings when they are getting up early to go to school on Thursday and Friday. We did not have any issues with being woken up early by them or by noise from being in Andree's house.,,,,
All in all,a wonderful space to stay in a mildly secluded part of Boston,"but with easy enough access to downtown and jamaica center that it didn't feel far away. \"",,,
336960,7837574,2013-10-05,8982735,Yves,"Andree is really a nice person. Very open-minded, great and she gave us a lot of information about Boston and the area. Bonus is the really cute dog. The flat is in a very quiet location and subway is 15 minutes away). The room is nice and the appartement has everything you need. We liked very much to be independent and free and appreciated Andrees trust. Breakfast and coffee was very appreciated. We missed nothing and would love to come back again. Thanks for everything."

336960,8464621,2013-11-01,20979,Adam,"Amazing place.  The separate entrance gave a sense privacy, but Andree was helpful and very welcoming.  Granola and yogurt in the morning was great.  A lot of nice green spaces to walk around nearby too."
336960,9279700,2013-12-17,10604108,Tom,Andree's home is groovy and she made us very comfortable there.  JP Greenhouse is our new first choice in the Boston area.
336960,9694670,2014-01-05,10875903,Kali,"This is a great place to stay if all you need is a comfortable bed and a place to sleep.  Andree is a great host, and was gracious and accommodating when we lost our key in a snowstorm and she had to come back from wherever she was to let us in.  We would stay again."
"\"",,,,,
336960,9847312,2014-01-13,2090987,Joe,Andree was a terrific host. The space is a large room with bathroom (and fire pole for the kids). The onstreet exit is nice for privacy. The location is easy to find and convenient to our Contra Dancing that evening. This is an interesting place to stay with a great intention around green design.
336960,9919138,2014-01-19,10634202,Stephen,Q: What's the only thing that travels faster than the speed of light?
A: Andree's response time! I wrote to Andree several times during normal business hours and she always answered within an hour. I was impressed,because other AirBnB hosts usually take at least 24 hours to respond. I was very impressed by Andree's professionalism.,,,,
Q. Andree says she has children so the house can noisy - will that bother me?,,,,,
A. No. I stayed 3 nights and only heard hushed voices. I remember being worried about the warning in the room description about the commotion of the children going to school at 6am. However,the house was quiet in the morning. If I had forgot to set my alarm,I would have probably slept in. You will hear a bit of talking around dinnertime,but the voices are low and will only bother the most ultra-sensitive visitors.,,
Q. The room description says the house is eco-friendly,so will I freeze to death?,,,,
A. No. I stayed in January and the room was comfortable. A space heater is also available if you wish. Also,the shower is sublime. The shower head is a square,"about 10\"\" per side. There is plenty of hot water.",,,
I am interested in environmental matters,so I asked Andree about the home. She pointed out some of special features in her house,"such as 16\"\" thick walls for insulation and doorways which are sealed to prevent drafts. Therefore",the house uses 80% less energy of an average house of a similar size. Very neat!,,
"I would stay again and recommend that you book a night here as well.\"",,,,,
336960,10454283,2014-02-19,11789847,Ellen,We had a wonderful stay at the JP Greenhouse. Andree was a wonderful hostess and we appreciated her recommendations for food and public transport. I would definately recommend the JP greenhouse to anyone looking to stay in the area.

336960,11030544,2014-03-17,12897900,Alice,"I stayed in Andree's House with more 2 friends, during St. Patrick's Day. The room is very simple, cozy and sweet. We found everything we needed and we had a great time (plus, homemade granola for breakfast)! It's clean and you have your own door, so you don't need cross the house. The localization is good too: is close to public transportation and cabs are not expensive. For sure I recommend Andree and this place!"
336960,11118585,2014-03-21,12460561,Helena,This house is beautiful and environmentally sustainable.  Easy to get to via a short bus ride or a nice walk.  I enjoyed the private space and the quiet neighborhood.
336960,11408473,2014-04-01,12807137,John,Great location and very interesting house. Well worth it and you might learn something about the future of housing.
336960,11603463,2014-04-08,420396,Sami,"Our stay at Andree's place was lovely. The space felt quite private and separate, since it has its own entrance and bathroom. The shared kitchen and simple breakfast was just what we needed. It was a really pleasant surprise to find that her home made granola is gluten free, and she even had rice milk on hand (awesome for those with intolerances and allergies!) My boyfriend enjoyed her home made yogurt, too."
We didn't find noise to be an issue at all. We came and went at all hours and used the space as a landing pad for 4 nights. The space is surprisingly well insulated and passively heated,but the space heater filled in on the chillier April evenings nicely.,,,,
"We loved Canyon the dog! I'd recommend this spot!\"",,,,,
336960,11702655,2014-04-12,14012007,Gregg,"My stay with Andree was a short one, done on short notice.  She was very responsive and helpful in explaining her accommodations and the unique home she has built/renovated."
The room is perfect.  Private entrance,own bathroom,and closed off from the rest of the house.  The location is close to many things you might need (transit,food,etc.),and yet on a very quiet street.
"I would definitely stay with Andree again.\"",,,,,
336960,11864364,2014-04-17,5507014,Lolo,"EDespite a quirky spring snowfall, we had a lovely stay st Andree's great Boston area partment. Wonderfully green and toasty even with cold weather throughout the 2 days we were in town. Andree is very knowledgeable of the area and how to get around Boston. Make sure you try her delicious homemade yogurt."
336960,12000855,2014-04-21,5609459,Rosa,"JP Green House is exactly what it says it is, cozy accomodation, ecologically responsible and extremly comfortable. Great private bathroom, great service by Andree, who always had breakfast ready for us in the morning, with home made yogourt, home made granola milk and coffe. The fact that the room is private and has a private entry gives you all the freedom and privacy you want and need and usually look for ! Great place, the T was a short walking distance. We really enjoyed our stay totally recommend it and would love to go back ! Thank you so much !"

The photos and description of the accomodations are accurate and thorough and there were no unpleasant surprises. In fact, the beds were more comfortable than they look in the pictures.  We appreciated the private entrance, the complimentary breakfasts, the very quiet neighborhood, and the proximity to public transportation.  Highly recommended."
336960,13024469,2014-05-17,8605875,Alan,We loved staying in the Green House.  It was a great space and Andree took good care of us.

She was friendly, provided a wonderful morning breakfast and easy to follow directions upon request. It was a short walk to most everything and very close to the metro station. I would stay here again."
336960,13352749,2014-05-26,12667907,Yee Kei,The room is really cosy for 3 of us to stay. It is very nice of Andrée to provide us with towels (folded neatly and place on the bed). Best all of is we get to enjoy organic breakfast! I believe that Andrée is one of the few hosts you can find in airbnb that provides free healthy organic breakfast! The place is really accessible as it's along the orange line of boston mbta. Neighborhood is really safe for us (3 girls) to return home late at night. Enjoy the stay at her house:) Thank you Andrée!
336960,13487892,2014-05-28,15469045,John,"Andree was a most obliging host.  We were upgraded to her studio apartment for her convenience.  The accommodation was simple and modern, but very comfortable.  We enjoyed the independence of our own space and the ability to self-cater .  Andree's instructtions and directions enabled us to make the most of the neighborhood and get to experience the Memorial Day weekend in Boston.  We can highly recommend the JP Green House."
336960,15116554,2014-07-02,17048589,Bryan,"Everything was just as described.  Andree was easy to get a hold of, helpful, and communicative. I had a car so driving around was the mode of tranportation.  I spent a few times walking and exploring the neighborhood.  I believe it was forest hills cemetery that provided the scenery, plesant.  I loved the room and coffee provided."
336960,15870014,2014-07-17,16178582,Leann,"This was our first experience with AirBnB and everything worked out wonderfully. It is great to save money and have a good experience. I appreciated Andree’s responsiveness in answering the questions we had before the trip. The room was as described, clean and ready. The bathroom was small, but everything worked very well and we enjoyed the extra large shower head. Towels, soap, and shampoo were provided. The coffee maker in the room was handy and the coffee was good. We also appreciated the cereal and toast available for breakfast. We found the space to be a very nice size for the two of us. The windows and fans provided enough cooling during the time we were there."
The neighborhood is lovely and we enjoyed walking in it. Andree also provided helpful information regarding nearby places to visit and eat. The arboretum near the Forest Hill station was worth visiting -- very beautiful. The Dogwood Cafe is across the street from the station and their Witch-hazel pizza was great!,,,,,
We were there for five nights,so we each got a 7 day pass for the Boston transit system as soon as we arrived and found it easy to get around. It is a short walk to the bus stop,if you don’t want to walk all the way to the station,and the buses run very often along that route.,,

We loved petting their dog Canyon in the mornings and eating homemade granola.  Everything about out stay was so easy - arrival, leaving, having breakfast put out for us in the morning, and Andree made herself available in case we needed anything (which we didn't because she's already included everything you could need in the room).  Would definitely stay here again!"
336960,16261918,2014-07-24,3469015,Adva,"This is my second visit to the JP green house. I actually changed my itinerary to be able to book it because it's wonderful! Clean, quiet and located at the end of the orange metro line, makes it very easy to see Boston's attractions such as the freedom trail and the Samuel Adams brewery. I would especially like to thank Andree, which always goes the extra mile making us feel right at home. Best Airbnb in Boston."
336960,16567571,2014-07-29,17376926,Kristin,"This was my first experience using AirBnB. Our party of three couldn't have had a better experience at the JP Green House. Entering the room it was bright, clean, and well organized. The ceiling is so high, which made the room feel light and airy and it cooled down well at night. It had nearly all the amenities we would have found in a hotel room but a much better price and in the neighborhood near the rest of our family."
We were in town for a family wedding and quite familiar with the area so getting around was easy for us. The location is incredibly convenient since Forest Hills train station is within walking distance.,,,,,
Andree was responsive and made sure that we had someone to ask questions of in case we needed anything. It made our weekend much less hectic,"so thanks to Andree! \"",,,,

Andree is practicing a low-impact green urban lifestyle, which is an interest of mine.  We took a tour of her organic garden where she grows herbs, eggplant, tomatoes, beans, and melons in a small backyard plot."
I wasn't even certain that we would have a private bathroom,but there was,so that was a pleasant surprise.,,,
While on vacation we spend very little time at our host's house and do lots of sight-seeing.  This trip we played around in Boston on Saturday and went to the Museum of Science an a Red Sox game on Sunday.,,,,,

We really liked the room, plenty of space and it's great having your own entrance to come and go, bathroom was clean and had a really good shower with wash and shampoo etc provided that my wife particularly liked. We also really appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities. Breakfast is a great bonus, nothing fancy but everything you could want, lovely cereal toast etc. Finally the location was great for getting into Boston, no hassle at all as you're on the end of the orange line - the station is about a 10 min walk but perfectly easy and safe. We would recommend as a great place to stay when visiting what we thought was a great town!"
336960,19531966,2014-09-14,19184029,Celena,"Andree's home was great! We got there late Thursday night and Andree had made the process easy. She gave me directions from the airport to the train and to her home, which is a QUICK walk from the Forest Hills train station. The key was waiting for us and our space was great, super comfortable for three people. We had our own shower and she left towels for us. In the morning there was breakfast set out for us if we chose to eat it (granola, cereal and toast)."

The space was super clean, the bed was EXTREMELY comfy and we really did have everything we needed in the room. Her dog was very sweet as was Andree herself, as she offered to drive me down to the train station the morning I was leaving, which was really such a big help.

Andree has takes great care to ensure that potential guests know what they are getting and how things work at the house. The description made it plain that it was not the handiest place for the T system if you were not the walking type, but that suited us fine. She was also crystal clear about the hours that she and her family kept so that there would be no avoidable inconvenience or disturbance, either way. We'd originally chosen the Green House for the chance of a comfortable perch in a quiet neighbourhood, with the considerable extra appeal of a separate entrance and our own bathroom. Our stay ticked all the important boxes plus a few more. Andree was welcoming, nicely straightforward, and an obviously very efficient host. The room was spacious, well appointed, comfortable and their was an abundance of clear written info in our room about just about anything that might be relevant to our basic needs.  But there was a big bonus. It was only when we showed up that we fully realised what a special and  unusual house it was. Andree is deeply committed to sustainable living, and this is reflected in the design of the house. It is super efficiently insulated and pretty much self sufficient in the energy needed for heat, light etc. The major surprise  was that it was comfortable,  attractive as well as distinctive,  and a nicely relaxed place to be, with no hint of the 'hair-shirt' attitude or impractical compromises that many people endure in the name of low carbon emissions and fuel economy. Andree is also a fine ambassador for her beliefs, neither nagging or proselytising about how anyone else should live. Just making a fine case when appropriate, in our brief conversations, and via a discrete reference to her fascinating and highly illuminating website and blogs. We learned a lot and were left with a lot to reflect on, in a very good way."
336960,22807557,2014-11-15,3191056,Petra,"This is a great place to stay! Easily accommodated all three of us. There's a private entrance to our room, which meant that we straightaways felt at home.  Oh, and fresh cut flowers on the table, which made for a cheery welcoming entrance, and almond chocolate snacks laid out for us, yum!  Andree and her children are a delight to talk to, and Canyon the dog is a sweetheart.  A wonderful place, highly recommended."
336960,25043463,2015-01-05,24697191,Robert,"The host left a clean, fully equipped place (in fact, an upgrade at the original lower price) with breakfast food and excellent instructions about the local neighborhood.  During a cold spell in Boston, the heat and hot water worked perfectly.  The host responded to all questions.  Though we used a car, the proximity of public transport was as stated.  We were busy with family from morning to night, so could not socialize with the host.  But the welcoming brightness and small touches of her place show she would have been welcoming."
336960,26220945,2015-02-07,18388746,Amanda,Great time! Thanks A!
336960,26605760,2015-02-16,22995038,Son Nam,"It was not too difficult for us to find the place because it is near the main road. From the place, it takes only 30 to 40 minutes to get to the city center."
The room is clean and the host is so nice. She helps us a lot and always reply any messages we sent quickly. She gives us bowls,dishes and plates and even shoes to walk during the snow time. She also has a dog who is really cute and friendly (I personally love him),,,,
The only problem is sometimes we got troubles with the hot water (sometimes so cold sometimes so hot). But except this small inconvenience,everything is perfect.,,,,
"I highly recommend you to stay in this place! :)\"",,,,,
336960,27046488,2015-02-24,24621838,Andrew,Enough attention.

336960,29349893,2015-04-06,17062821,Kimberly,"Andree was friendly and helpful. Her homemade granola was just awesome. I enjoyed the neighborhood too - took a walk in the Arnold Arboretum, spent some time in Caffe Nero and had meals in JP seafood and Vee Vee. Great time there!"
336960,29629863,2015-04-10,29393992,Rebecca,"Everything was as listed and wonderful!  Andree was just a text away when I had questions and responded promptly.  Great place for families to stay, my kids (and the adults too) loved the room and location."
336960,30373336,2015-04-21,17430362,Kerry,"Andree made us feel very welcome.  Our room was lovely, ready with towels, tea, coffee.  The neighborhood is quiet.  Andree also let us use the washer/dryer.  Very nice and generous."
336960,30687632,2015-04-26,29405945,Clare,We had a very nice stay with Andree! She was very helpful with anything we needed. Beautiful neighborhood with a really cool old cemetery nearby. The room was clean and well kept and Andree had a solid collection of menus from local restaurants. Very cool to stay in a solar powered house.
336960,31458177,2015-05-05,1445651,Kelli,"Andrée's listing was a great little room that was very comfortable and accurate. She made us feel very welcome and relaxed, even though we didn't have a whole lot of contact. (Just due to scheduling and what not.)"
The beds were very comfortable with warm,comfy linens and blankets. And the pillows were also comfy. (Something that doesn't always happen.),,,,
Her dog was super laid back and welcoming. He seemed to be all for any scratching and petting we'd give him.,,,,,
She has a great book selection and a lot of knowledge to share about urban farming and becoming self-sustaining. If anything,my only dissatisfaction with the visit is that I didn't get a chance to talk with her more.,,,,
If I'm in the Boston area again anytime soon,I'll definitely by looking to stay here again.,,,,

336960,31622850,2015-05-07,32592468,Vincent,"The room looked really good, clean and a lot of natural light. The room's shower was broken so we had a little rebate on the price."
"Andrée was really nice. It was a little noisy in the morning because the kitchen is right next to the room's door. \"",,,,,
336960,31820993,2015-05-10,30838349,Will,The room was clean and had everything we needed.
336960,32243834,2015-05-16,26655477,Mayra,Overall it was a great place to stay. Andree was very helpful and attentive. The room was big and clean. It was a little far from downton Boston but nothing ridiculous. Good place if traveling with a couple friends.

336960,35475524,2015-06-19,29763138,Mengmeng,"My parents and I stayed at Andree's place for 6 nights. It's a basic room but the kitchen is right next to it, which is very convenient. I like the shower as well. Hair dryer, shampoo, shower gel, etc. are all provided. JP is very green. Andree's house is not in the best area in JP but for the price it is a good deal. You can get to the beautiful area in JP (parks, lake) within a short drive."

Andrée était présente à notre arrivée pour des explications très succinctes. Le quartier est très calme, sans grand intérêt mais proche du centre par le metro compter 30 min a pied."
336960,43025212,2015-08-17,12187685,Livia,"Io, mio marito e mio figlio di 15 anni siamo stati per motivi di studio a Boston dal 9 luglio al 17 agosto 2015. Abbiamo affittato la stanza di Andree perché il prezzo era conveniente per gli standard di Boston e perché collegata con il centro (meta quotidiana di studio) con la metro Orange line. Il quartiere è grazioso e tranquillo perché solo residenziale, ma da casa alla metro ci vogliono 20 minuti a piedi e con il caldo, la pioggia, il buio o la stanchezza, il tragitto non è molto piacevole; lo stesso vale per raggiungere un negozio, un supermercato  o per un posto dove mangiare (fatta eccezione per un piccolo fast food Big Bites a circa 10 min dove sono molto gentili e portano anche il cibo a casa). La stanza è spaziosa, meglio per 2 perché il letto sul soppalco è scomodo; è calda in modo particolare, anche rispetto al soggiorno/cucina ed i ventilatori danno poco sollievo, il wi-fi non funziona bene. Forse la sistemazione è più adatta per periodi più brevi del nostro e in stagione meno afosa."
336960,43948752,2015-08-23,789339,Daven,"\"This was a great spot to land in in Boston, and perfectly accommodated myself, my daughter and my son, in the loft.  This room is more like it's own apartment with the private bath as part of the space.  I appreciated staying in a \"\"green\"\" home and the clever design of our space.  Andree was a very easy host.  We felt at home having our breakfast in the kitchen in the morning"
336960,45327808,2015-09-01,34052539,Gina,"Andree was very friendly and welcoming. When I arrived, she gave me ideas of where to eat nearby. The neighborhood was quiet and the parking easy. Even  before I came, she was helpful with questions I had, and quick to respond."
336960,45486125,2015-09-03,36004233,Peter,It is just as described.  A nice room in a green house in a quiet neighborhood.  I drove in and had no trouble finding parking.

336960,49834273,2015-10-06,1265529,Nancy,"We spent one night in a very pleasant, clean and pretty room. The room seemed a bit smaller that my perception from the photos but it was enough for both of us. Is very original and corky. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful. I'd would have preferred to be closer to Centre street in JP to be able to walk to my favorites restaurants, cafes, etc but we had a car so it was not an issue. Andree was very cordial the few times I saw her and We appreciated the breakfast choices."
336960,50271977,2015-10-11,33364342,Cécile,"Le logement est situé dans un quartier résidentiel, il faut compter 40 min de métro (arrêt à 15 min à pieds) pour rejoindre le centre de Boston."
La chambre était propre. Les draps,serviettes et produits de base (non utilisés) étaient fournis (également sèche-cheveux,fer à repasser,plans de la ville). Andree fournit également de quoi prendre le petit déjeuner ; personnellement nous avons préféré le prendre à l'extérieur,"la cafetière à piston n'était pas notre \"\"truc\"\".",
En revanche,nous n'avons pas très bien dormi à cause du bruit (venant de la rue et de la maison) et de la lumière (le rideau n'est pas du tout occultant). De plus,le wifi,qui était un de nos critères de choix étant à l'étranger,était plus que capricieux.,
Enfin,la chambre donne sur la cuisine ; or la double porte en bois ne ferme pas,"rendant la chambre pas tout à fait \"\"private\"\". Mais nos hôtes se sont absentés le weekend ce qui a compensé.",,,

Her house is pretty close to the city and the transfer is easy. Andree was so nice, she gave us the bigger apartment to have more space for us three. All in all its a nice place to stay, for younger people too! :)"

Man kann alles wichtige fußläufig erreichen (innerhalb einer Meile) Die Fahrt in die Stadt dauert ca. 20 Minuten, was völlig OK ist. Die Gegend ist super schön und es lohnt sich, einen ausgedehnten Spaziergang zu machen. Die kommunikation mit Andree war einfach und unkompliziert und wir haben jederzeit Hilfe von ihr bekommen. Wir können einen Aufenthalt absolut empfehlen."

336960,95381805,2016-08-19,20326481,John,Andree was very accommodating and answered all questions before and during our stay in a timely manner.  The house is very simple yet functional which is exactly what I was looking for.  The location is wonderful with easy access to the bus and rail.  We did not rent a car and had zero issues with getting around town.  The transit schedules are very flexible.
The space was clean and was a great value.  Although the listing clearly states that there is no a/c,the two fans provided (box fan and desk fan) did not provide adequate airflow.  I am from Texas and am accustomed to hot weather,it was 107 in Texas a few days before we left for Boston.  During our stay the temps only got up to the mid 80s and we were uncomfortably warm due to lack of airflow.,,,

The location is perfect for theater buffs and is a short walk to other Boston landmarks. While the apartment is on the same street as the theater where Blue Man Group performs, the crowd dispersed quickly and the street remained pretty quiet."

3653207,32360248,2015-05-17,16479601,Maurice,"Apartment looks great and matches posted pictures. Only downside was noisy people exiting the adjacent clubs in the middle of the night and, on two nights, motorcycles revving like Indy cars in the alleyway.  Karen provided essential information in advance and responded quickly to questions. Location is fantastic with easy access to sights and eateries. Boston Commons is just a couple of blocks away. We started out our first day with breakfast at Paramount, about a 15 minute walk. It was so good, we went back on our last day. Thanks Karen!"

The unit is nicely appointed, nicely kept, and very central -- close to the T, and easy walking distance to everything from the north end to the back bay."
3653207,33611672,2015-05-30,24726481,Judy,"Karen's place is accurately represented in the photos. Lots of eateries nearby, Chinatown is along the street, and the Boston Common is just a short walk away. It's also only 10-15 minutes away from the Boston Convention & Exhibition Centre. We used Uber a lot to get around, and the W Hotel is a great landmark. Taxis are also readily available at the W. Our only problem with the location was the noise made by people in the street at night during the weekend. Checking in and out was a breeze. Washers and dryers are available in the basement. Karen is super - very nice, helpful, informative, and always responded promptly to messages. Thanks again for having us!"
3653207,34232421,2015-06-06,13614261,Jon,"The place was as described, and very clean. Although the street is quite noisy, the location is superb. Karen had excellent communication, the key was ready to go, and everything was smooth. Thanks for a great stay in Boston"

I arrived late and she had left a key and let me know all the necessary codes which meant it was stress free. The apartment was just like the photos. The neighbourhood was nice and it was very easy to get to anywhere you wanted. I felt very at home and would highly recommend it to anyone else."
3653207,38058971,2015-07-12,37428331,Jon,Karen was excellent and a great communicator.
Apartment is very clean,with a separate bedroom with door.  It's literally in the alley next to the W hotel,only a 75 yard walk,and it is true there are nightclubs next door.  However,unlike other reviewers I never had a sound issue for the 4 nights I was there.  The apartment has tons of amenities you would expect in a hotel.  Only thing I would improve is the bedding and pillows,everything else was fantastic.  This was my 1st rental and admit I was nervous
3653207,39852016,2015-07-26,38703719,Brendon,"Karen (host) runs a tight, responsive ship. Her communications were almost precognitive. Always polite and professional, she was an absolute dream to work with."
The apartment was exactly as shown and as expected. The place was clean and thoughtfully equipped with things that we might need for our stay. Right in the heart of the theater district,"it was perfect for the type of Boston experience that we were looking for.\"",,,,
3653207,40188278,2015-07-28,30408636,Eric,The place was tidy and quaint upon arrival and the host was very easy to work with to coordinate arrival / departure. Highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in a quiet part of Boston with direct access to the city!

3653207,45635280,2015-09-04,42912302,Raj,Host Karen was very Helpful.
3653207,46410160,2015-09-10,4678579,Kara,"This apartment had a lot of things going for it, and a couple of (potentially temporary) drawbacks. So the positive first! The apartment was lovely - very clean, nicely furnished, and felt spacious even though it's fairly compact. It was quite hot most of my trip but the window AC units kept the apartment very comfortable and cool. There's a full kitchen and a decent set of equipment for cooking. The location is also great - safe walking around at night, lots of restaurants - and of course lots of theater if you want to catch a play! Pretty centrally located in the span of Boston too, between South Boston, downtown Boston, and Cambridge. Very easy to get an uber whenever I needed one."
The significant drawback I experienced,which may be temporary,was a very loud and persistent drip right next to the bed in the bedroom,every 15-30 seconds over 48 hours. It sounded to me like it was a leak or drip from the AC unit in the unit above this one,dropping and echoing on the unit in the bedroom window. It was right next to the bed for whatever reason of the acoustics it was incredibly loud - and I live in Manhattan over a motorcycle bar,literally
Once summer is over and the AC unit above won't be dripping I would definitely recommend this apartment,but I don't feel like I can leave this out given how loud I found it - if that were still going to be happening I wouldn't stay here again. Hopefully the host can remedy this,"in which case it's a great apartment option.\"",,,
3653207,48479678,2015-09-26,35472975,Sam,Karen was very welcoming and accepted our booking at very short notice.  She communicated really promptly during our stay and we wouldn't hesitate in recommending her to anyone wanting to stay in Boston.  The apartment was really clean and it had everything needed for a short stay in the city.  Thanks for everything!!
3653207,49055059,2015-09-30,38952982,Laura,The apartment was incredibly clean and very comfortable. The space was perfectly located for a short business trip. Karen was incredibly responsive and gracious during all our communications about arrival and check-out.
3653207,49674125,2015-10-05,12373239,Natalie,"I stayed here 5 nights with my daughter for a long weekend of sightseeing.  Even though we never saw her, I found Karen to be a fine host, very kind, organized, and responsive. The actual space is just like the photographs, tidy and clean. The bed was quite comfortable, there were adequate towels and linens. She even provides soap, shampoo and conditioner. She had everything you might need in the kitchen to cook any kind of meal."
That said,in five nights I did not sleep a single night in peace.  Apparently,there is a club or two just down the street. It is relatively quiet until about 10:30-11 p.m. But don't be fooled! Just when you think the noise won't get any worse and you'll be able to sleep,that's when the street noise below becomes insane. There is no escape from it anywhere in the apartment. Cars are lined up on both streets with honking,police sirens blasting,men and women laughing
The outside of the building is not what I expected. It is situated between a small theater and the clubs on a narrow one-way street. There were bags of trash outside waiting for pick-up for far too long. The building is nondescript,and has a For Sale sign in the window. A code will let you in to the foyer where it either smells like urine or marijuana depending on the time of day you pass through. There was junk mail strewn throughout the whole time.  A second door code lets you into the stairwell.  It smells musty with a hint of pee. It is an old building and it was humid so this may have contributed to these odors.   I think it would be fair to suggest to the host that she include photographs of the surrounding area in the listing to give an accurate portrayal of what we are paying for.,,,,
I also think it is fair to suggest to the host that she change her settings to less restrictive on departure in case the person renting the place is unhappy.  I would have left sooner with my young daughter if I'd been able to.  Karen might also consider lowering the overall rental rate due to these issues even though the actual space is very nicely appointed. The problems mentioned above are huge detractors. I would not complain if I had been properly warned. I'm surprised the other reviewers were so gentle in mentioning the noise and smells. A more accurate picture would have given me the chance to make a more informed decision.,,,,,
"This is a good place for a young couple who might enjoy the club scene while taking in the sights of Boston. \"",,,,,
3653207,49919033,2015-10-07,44184569,Steve,"Great little place and great hosting from Karen! The apartment is in a great location, just off of Boston Common, and very close to downtown, only about 30 mins cab-ride from the airport. Cute decor, very clean, and everything I needed for a couple of days business trip. Karen was also very timely in contacting me with check in and check out details, and I had no problems with either. Very good experience!"
3653207,50601195,2015-10-12,190194,Allen,"Apartment was great! Easy to get to downtown, easy to walk everywhere. The couches and rooms were so fun and eclectic."

3653207,60741585,2016-01-26,3893103,Girijesh,"My guest had a great time staying at Karen's centrally located apartment. She was extremely responsive, and clear with her instructions. Would highly recommend the apartment to anyone looking for the biggest bang for their buck in the heart of Boston's theater district."
3653207,63980563,2016-02-28,4085870,Cody,Pros:
- Karen is flexible about check-in and check-out times. All of that went smoothly.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
-The apartment is significantly overpriced given its area (downtown,flanking Chinatown).,,,,
- It gets extraordinarily loud (honking,yelling) between 11pm-1am so beware if these are times during which you would like to be sleeping.,,,,
- The apartment is above two divey nightclubs.,,,,,
- The building smells like marijuana during almost all times of the day.,,,,,
- The furniture is generally chintzy and cheap.,,,,,
Karen was kind over text messaging and tried to make our stay convenient. However,"I would not recommend her apartment. There are many better places to stay in Boston. \"",,,,
3653207,64970295,2016-03-09,511585,Aliza,Keren's place was perfectly located for my 24 hour work trip and check-in couldn't have been easier. She was very responsive in all communication and the place was clean and tidy. There was an extremely strong smell of scented candles or air freshener which was a little overwhelming but other than that the place was great.
3653207,68076531,2016-04-02,25812746,Samantha,My fiancé and I enjoyed our stay at Karen's apartment. The location could not have been more convenient with our show at the Wilbur that evening. Karen's instructions were very clear and she was responsive to all my questions. Would definitely stay there again!

"Thanks! \"",,,,,
3653207,72754652,2016-05-04,39958327,Sophie,"Karen was a great host from start to finish, although we didn't meet her, everything ran smoothly, and she was always quick to answer any questions we had. This apt was in walking distance to just about anything you want to get to, Boston Common, the start of the Freedom Trail, Southie, shopping areas, Newbury, and the subway. So many great restaurants, bars, and cafes around! It can be a little noisy in the morning with trash vans driving by, or on Fri & Sat nights due to the nightclubs next door but if you're planning on being out yourself anyway then this is perfect for you & it didn't negatively impact our stay at all!"
3653207,74079661,2016-05-13,40723717,Luis,"Great place! Was close to everything, clean, easily accessible, and Karen was a great host. Thank you for allowing me to stay, would stAy again."

Karen was easy to communicate with and very accommodating when we arrived a bit early.  The front of the building is not very impressive, but we knew that from previous reviews, however once you are in the apartment is was absolutely great!"
3653207,75002418,2016-05-18,34520320,Beatrice,"Karen's space is very unique, great location and clean."

3653207,75778467,2016-05-23,57236389,Nikole,"Beautiful apartment, convenient and fun location. Karen responded quickly, and was extremely helpful and communicative."
3653207,79732904,2016-06-13,60510499,Elisa,Karen was wonderful! Always answered any questions my boyfriend and I had while staying at her place. The apartment was clean and more than enough room. We were hoping the location would be closer to the Back Bay area but it only about a 10 minute uber to the restaurants on Newbury Street.
The only complaint is that it was incredibly noisy at night. The apartment is located near the W hotel which has a lounge that's open until the early morning. There's also several other clubs in the area. We were woken up repeatedly until about 3 am. We were surprised considering it was a Sunday night as well.,,,,,
Karen was a great host,"however I would only recommend this apartment to those who will be staying out late so the noise issue would not be a problem.  \"",,,,
3653207,80589755,2016-06-19,42148197,Henning,"Very nice place, great location, great responsivess, I was very satified!"
3653207,81654161,2016-06-24,4697106,Elisabetta,Appartamento con diverse pecche:
l'ingresso condominiale e scale sono indecenti,sporche,maleodoranti insomma ingiovabili,,,
La notte e'rumorosissimo c'è un rumore continuo di motori macchine ect,praticamente non si dorme nonostante che sia in un vicolo molto poco trafficato è un po' tetro,,,,
Il letto non è un matrimoniale quindi due persone non stanno comode,,,,,
La biancheria,era spero pulita,ma non stirata,,,
Comunque abbiamo speso oltre 250 euro a notte che non è proprio economico per la zona che non è back bay come si legge sul l'annuncio.,,,,,
Io non lo consiglierei e mi attendevo molto di più,,,,,

3653207,85093906,2016-07-10,6878220,Alexander,"Ease of check in and convenient location however the noise level from the surrounding clubs and musty stairwell dampened the experience. Overall, this was a decent option and we enjoyed our time in Boston."

Michael was extremely welcoming and even gave me the run down on the area, things to do, see and try. Even though it's not standard to have wine glasses in a room, he was great enough to bring me some once he returned home and didn't really have to do this."
10494550,67234397,2016-03-27,62257719,Adedayo,"The pictures don't do the space justice. Spacious room with so many amenities that you feel like you're in your own apartment. When I arrived, Mike was waiting outside the house to welcome me, gave me a tour of the space and how to use the controls for the thermostat and tv. He was also very helpful in giving me directions of where to get groceries/eat - everything I needed was within 10min walking distance. I was in town for a conference and Mike was able to show me how best to get to my destination."
The room has a cozy atmosphere and you have a dining table,2 chairs with fine china,cutleries and so on.,,,

The private room/bath was impeccably neat, clean and very comfortable--especially the gas fireplace (where do you see that?!?).  The private entrance was a definite plus.

Since I was there for a convention, I asked him if it would be ok to have a bunch of large boxes shipped to his home before the event, and he was very accommodating about it."
The room was clean and private with a separate entrance. It was more like a private apartment than a private room. In addition to what you can see in the photo,there was also a mini-fridge,microwave,a coffee machine,and a table for eating (complete with plates and place setting).,

10494550,86208799,2016-07-15,50545033,Sourav,"I took the Silver Line to World Trade Center Avenue and then a Uber to Michael's place. It was very easy to find and check in was done in a flash. The private entrance and private bathroom were really two great aspects of the place. I had a very busy schedule which required late night access and the private entry ensured any other guests or the host was not disturbed. The WiFi works great. The microwave and the small fridge came in handy too. The bed was really comfy and the linen was very fresh and clean. Overall, the place was very clean and well maintained and also quiet."
Above all,Michael was a fantastic host.   He went out of his way to accommodate my urgent need for a laundry amidst my insanely hectic schedule,even though he had his own engagements. He was very prompt to reply to any message and extremely easy to approach.,,,
I will recommend Michael as a host,"without any reservation.\"",,,,
10494550,86473355,2016-07-16,6549365,Nissa,Michael guest bedroom was exactly what I was looking for to extend my business trip Michael was very welcoming and accommodating on the hot afternoon of my check-in. The room was clean and comfortable and as described. Thank you for opening your home to me. Hi to Fiona; she's a sweety!
10494550,87568883,2016-07-20,38493028,Bethany,My stay at Michael's was great. We didn't actually meet until I was about to leave as the place is very self-contained and you can be completely self-sufficient but he was a very pleasant guy and great over email when I was sorting out my travelling plans.
10494550,87805317,2016-07-21,55226620,Kirsten,Michael was a very lovely and super accommodating host. He was very helpful when I arrived.
The room was large with all amenities and very clean.,,,,,
"Highly recommend this for anyone needing to be near the heart of the city/harbour as it was an easy walk then bus ride into town. \"",,,,,
10494550,88092883,2016-07-23,70023257,Pamela,"Michael is very friendly and welcoming and I liked meeting his sweet dog, Fiona. A very comfortable place for an overnight stay in Boston."
10494550,88882418,2016-07-25,68582038,Karina,We had an overall great experience.  Mike was very hospitable and the arrival process was hassle free.  The neighborhood is safe and clean and fairly close to public transportation.  The room was clean and the private entrance was super convenient.  The only issue we had was figuring out the bus system and that comes from our own ignorance of bus systems.  Again we had a great experience and I would stay with Mike again.
10494550,89712512,2016-07-29,34313491,Jimmy,"This place is a gem! It was clean, had a separate entrance, large comfortable bed, nice clean amenities, and a fridge & microwave -- everything to mimic a bona fide hotel room. Location was great, especially for those looking for access to the Convention Center or Seaport District."
Michael was a wonderful host. He is prompt,thorough,very friendly,"and made the stay very comfortable. Highly recommended!!\"",,
10494550,90409290,2016-08-01,74117782,Sarah,"Michael was very responsive throughout the whole process. His place is in a great neighborhood with food, shops and entertainment within walking distance or just an uber ride away. The room is clean and great for a weekend away."
10494550,90937900,2016-08-03,66310858,Roberta,Ottima esperienza. Micheal è stato disponibile e rapido nel rispondere ad ogni nostra richiesta. La stanza è esattamente come descritta nell'annuncio e completa di tutto il necessario. Grazie ad Uber gli spostamenti sono stati rapidi. Altamente consigliata.
10494550,91039118,2016-08-03,45003218,Brent,"Michael was a great host and very welcoming. We loved the location. Close to a lot of the action in Boston, but very quiet. We would love to come back again!"
10494550,91897278,2016-08-07,76003128,Alexis,"Our stay was awesome and this place is in a great location (walkable to great restaurants, cafes, harpoon brewery, and more). Michael our host was very accommodating with everything we needed. We had never been to Boston before so he recommended many places for us to eat and go see. Great experience and amazing trip!"
10494550,93900422,2016-08-14,48047473,Samuel,"My girlfriend and I had a great time in Boston and at Michael's place. The place looks exactly as shown in the pictures. The neighbourhood is nice, close to a supermarket, coffeeshops and restaurants. It has also good access to public transportation. Unfortunately, we didn't meet Michael in person but he was very quick in answering our msgs when necessary. The only negative point for us was parking. We were not able to find a spot nowhere close by and therefore we decided to return our rental car earlier than planned to the airport and use public transportation. At the end, it was a great idea to use public transportation, but a bit annoying due to the changes in our plan."
10494550,93981276,2016-08-14,15090305,Jeff,"Nice space in South Boston.  Easy check in, clean and quiet!"
10494550,95793410,2016-08-21,75982894,Andrea,Michael provides an acceptable product at a very competitive price. The location was perfect for our needs.
Overnight street parking is restricted to residents only. This could be a problem.,,,,,
When running,you can hear the A/C compressor noise in the room. This might be a problem for some.,,,,
Michael was quickly and totally responsive to our few requests.,,,,,
Were we to visit Boston again,"I would consider staying with Michael.\"",,,,
10494550,97286456,2016-08-26,60985311,Melanie,"Michael was a great host! Great communication, very friendly and the room was perfect. Very clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet and there were several stores just a block away. Very close to the convention center with made it great for me since I was there on business. It was just a $2 ride with Uber. I would definitely come back and recommend Michael to anybody coming to South Boston."
6976414,87923089,2016-07-22,79648955,Liyan,"留学生租的公寓,设施较好,尤其是位置非常好,离地铁站很近,出行方便,周边超市也多,不远,步行即可。卫生间也是独立的,比较难得。推荐!"
6976414,98537827,2016-08-31,43459580,Lily,"Regina's place was cozy and quiet. Bfresh,Starmarket & Starbucks is close by. It's easy to go to everywhere with the green T as well."
3575220,18813596,2014-09-01,11091090,Roshan,This place was great.
It is a room in his house,very spacious and nice. He is a wonderful guy,very knowledgable about the area and always willing to help. My only problem is that the wifi was not as strong in the rooms. But you are free to use and part of the house,and the tv and wifi in the basement.  The house itself was about 40 minutes from central Boston,one bus and train. The bus stop is about 1 minute walk,drops you at the subway station no problem. Great place
3575220,20077961,2014-09-22,5707932,Krupa,The reservation was canceled 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3575220,20430036,2014-09-29,19866731,Saman,"Mohamed is the best host one could ask for. He was so polite, respectful, and hospitable. When I first arrived, he helped me bring my heavy luggage up into the room, and gave me a quick tour of the place. After I settled in, he described the neighborhood to me, which is very quiet and safe, and helped me navigate the city. He knows the bus schedule inside and out, he can answer all your questions. The bathrooms are very clean, and he has a new washer in the basement. Oh and the basement is awesome. Very cozy with a nice tv and lots of channels, especially if you are big soccer fan. And he also recently got a WiFi amplifier for the house. So, the place is fantastic. In addition, there are a couple restaurants that are 1-minute walking distance if you want a quick bite, and there are many more about a 15-minute walk away at the Roslindale Square, really good Italian food and bakery shops. Mohamed is just a great guy. He's very friendly, has lots of good stories, and knows Boston like no one else. He's always sharing his fruits and little snacks. And he's a great cook! One night, I was waiting for a taxi to come pick me up to go to South Station, but it was running really late. Mohamed, without hesitation, jumped into his car and was ready to give me a ride all the way to South Station. Fortunately, the taxi finally came. But this is the kind of host you want. Someone that will look after you, and is a good person. With all of this said, I HIGHLY recommend renting this place. You will not be disappointed."
3575220,21360227,2014-10-15,8481534,Ufuk,Mohamed is a true gentlemen and hospitality example. His place in very quiet neighborhood. Bus stop right corner of house!
3575220,22256240,2014-11-02,22454898,Joey,"It was as advertised.  Nice place, nice owner, everything worked.  Felt like home for the short time I was there."
3575220,38333137,2015-07-14,35353825,Julien,Mohamed is a good man. The room is nice and clean. We had a wonderful time during my five days stay at his place. Mohamed is very helpful to his guest. I would stay at his place again.
"Mamy Julien\"",,,,,
3575220,45073927,2015-08-31,5838124,Anna,"I stayed at Mohamed's place for 6 weeks. He's a great guy with a good sense of humor, very easy-going and always helpful. He took me to different places and showed me around and I really felt at home there."
The room is pretty and has a good size with lot's of space to store your stuff. Wifi works perfectly in the entire house and even outside in the garden.,,,,,
By the way the garden is a gorgeous hideaway to read and relax. Mohamed grows flowers,herbs and planted trees 20 years ago. Try the hammock and I bet you don't wanna leave it again.,,,,
Thank you very much for a wonderful time,"Mohamed :). I'd love to come back one day! \"",,,,
3575220,95975535,2016-08-21,45313657,Lalitha,"When I migrated to the US alone, Mohameds' was the first placed I stayed in. And I am glad I made that choice. He is a genuinely kind person and an absolute gentleman. He is always there when you need help and yet gave me the personal space that I needed. The room itself is comfortable and sufficiently furnished. The entire home is open to the guests; which I had spent more time relaxing in the garden. I would highly recommend his place yo anyone considering."
12379725,70324030,2016-04-17,1171138,Bryce,Easy and organized check in.  Apartment was clean upon arrival and location was very convenient for a trip to Fenway.

Had a nice time there.,,,,,
"Thanks\"",,,,,
12379725,72270694,2016-05-01,65156802,Kini,Great place to stay!
12379725,73717447,2016-05-09,66398957,Vindhya,Good aprtment. It was spacious. Enjoyed the stay here.
13192046,88314079,2016-07-24,71610889,Simone,"Absolutely fabulous time.  Ruth was a fantastic host, nothing was too much trouble.  She established a friendly rapport through email prior to our arrival.  Following through, by personally welcoming us.  Ruth also left a gorgeous array of food for our breakfast.  She was only a phone call away and reassured us that if we needed anything she was happy to help.  The home is beautifully furnished, clean and family friendly.  Easy commute to Harvard University in a really safe neighborhood.  Highly recommended."
13192046,90021218,2016-07-30,73943665,Melanie,"We had a wonderful vacation in the Boston area. The townhouse was exceptional. Well cared for, clean, and welcoming , area appeared safe, we had no issues. It was everything the host said it would be! We were in contact with the host several times and she responded quickly and politely. Beds were  super comfortable, the unit had dual controls for the HVAC!( I need this at my house!) We would highly recommend  this property! Short drive into downtown Boston, or public transportation is just outside the property."
13192046,99521402,2016-09-05,53600178,Elaine,"This is an absolutely WONDERFUL place to stay!!! The house is brand new and gorgeous! Ruth and Ryan were amazing hosts! They went way above and beyond what we expected and were so gracious and helpful in every way. The house was incredibly well stocked with everything you could need as well as a huge selection of food to prepare breakfast for our three week stay. It included champagne, orange juice, eggs, cereal, muffins, bread, yogurt, jam, butter, milk, coffee, tea and a HUGE selection of fruit (also freshly cut flowers on the table)! The house is in a great location with the Mass Turnpike only minutes away by car and public transportation into downtown Boston right outside the door. The neighborhood is safe and the neighbors are very friendly and welcoming. We had a fantastic vacation and would highly recommend this beautiful home and super hosts Ruth and Ryan!!!!"
8325544,83159719,2016-07-01,69789380,Jennifer,These units are in a great location and immaculate in terms of cleanliness. Welcome packages with small necessities are a nice touch.  They are however serviced by a maintenance company with limited hours and poor turnaround time. I would not recommend for short term rentals. Spending your first couple of days getting no things resolved may be ok for a long term rental but not acceptable to spend 2 out of 4 day stay dealing with issues.  The host and maintenance company were informed Internet was a critical service necessary to facilitate working during our stay and did not respond with any urgency - we finally convinced cable company to come out directly to find the service was not plugged in at the panel in the utility closet.
12914154,78382529,2016-06-06,75259338,Amanda,"Janet was so kind and hospitable. Her space was clean and cozy and we really enjoyed our time there. We appreciated the coffee she left for us, and being able to buy some breakfast to make before we ventured out into Boston. She was very helpful and accommodating. We would definitely stay here again."
12914154,91435429,2016-08-05,14564217,Tyler,"My co-workers and I were in town for a conference and we loved, more than anything, how close J's apartment was to everything. It was less than a ten minute walk to restaurants and bars and only a 14 minute walk from the green line stop."
Also,it had a spectacular view of the Charles River and it was nice being able to walk down to the trail next to the river for an evening stroll.,,,,
The apartment itself was cozy and had its own kitchenette.,,,,,
"I would definitely recommend this place to any of my friends who come to Boston.\"",,,,,
12914154,92888047,2016-08-10,11184764,Catherine,"Great apartment, actually much nicer than on the photos! Easy communication with host. Everything was A1, I would return again without hesitation."
12914154,97131749,2016-08-26,86707708,Robin,This was my first experience with airbnb and it did not disappoint! J was easy to work with and her home was very welcoming. My only issue was that it was on the 4th floor and there was no elevator. With a broken foot I adapted easily but just something I didn't expect! Overall a nice experience!
12914154,97728836,2016-08-28,6475356,Brian,"Accurate, great location, the street and neighborhood is awesome.  The antlers above the fireplace were the best."
13968572,90614479,2016-08-01,3278141,Roman,"Lovely apartment, very cozy and in a very convenient location - close to all the shops and public transport. Perfect for solo travelers. Lizzy is a great host and was very accommodating when my travel arrangements changed last minute because of work. Highly recommended!"
13968572,92375325,2016-08-08,3278141,Roman,"I had 2 separate bookings - so 2 separate reviews. But the feedback is the same - great place, lovely host, nice area with all the amenities, and good value for money. Definitely recommend it!"
6796364,92044063,2016-08-07,20465788,Brandon,"Maxwell is very welcoming and talkative. He's a good host, and makes you feel comfortable to use the apartment. He offered us coffee in the mornings and wine at night. His cats are very cute, and curious. Just be careful, because they are cats and like to scratch different materials and jump in your luggage. No big deal if you like cats, or close your door to prevent entry. The rooftop gives a nice view of the Boston Skyline. We were in town for work, so only used the apartment as a place to rest at night. The only negative comments I have are related to an obnoxious smell at the building entryway, and the hallway leading to the apartment. The apartment itself did not smell. We also had issues sleeping at night since it was hot out, and the airconditioning was turned off. I recommend discussing is with eachother at the beginning of the stay, so nobody has to feel uncomfortable. I recommend providing a floor fan for the room, since the aircon is for the entire home and not controllable by individual rooms, this would help to lower the perceived temperature."
The neighborhood is mixed. It not a beautiful section,but is good walking distance to very nice areas. There are however really good restaurants in short walking distance. These places are hip and trendy,with good food.,,,
The main thing I worry about when renting a shared room in someone's house is,"will I feel welcomed and are they friendly. The answer here is yes.\"",,,,
8814105,54352179,2015-11-18,24017269,Xu,Really fancy condo in an amazing location. We stayed on the 37th floor where we could oversee the entire Boston region. Everything is just perfect.
8814105,55962733,2015-12-07,5127105,Jeffrey,The apt was in a great location and is very nice and felt secure. Would definitely stay here again.
8814105,56508254,2015-12-14,44293244,Lindsay,We stayed a long weekend at Jordan's beautiful apartment. Five of us stayed and there was plenty of room! The place was very clean and had everything we needed. Parking was easy. The views were spectacular. Everything was in walking distance. All of us had a great time and will be back for sure!
8814105,56810327,2015-12-18,26659435,Jiajun,This place is very nice and modern!!! The house is huge and the beds are large. It has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms which make it very convenient for larger group. Subway is within 8 min walking which is nice.
8814105,61394798,2016-02-03,30380521,Chris,This was a great apartment and location in Boston (15 minute walk to the aquarium).  Jordan was very responsive and made the whole experience from reservation to getting in and leaving super easy.  I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone visiting Boston.

The parking pass was convenient,but the proximity to TD Garden,North Station,and Bowdoin was even better!,,
The apartment had speedy wifi and the X1 cable system so while not out on the town there is entertainment,I checked out the theatre in the lobby area too and it was pretty neat.,,,,
The convenience of where this place is located is absolutely fantastic.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
8814105,67399307,2016-03-29,15655858,Jules,"Jordan's apartment is very well situated, close to both the North End and Chinatown.  It is spacious, with three good-sized bedrooms, a large living and dining room, a comfortable kitchen, a half bath close to the entrance, and lots of closets everywhere.  Because it is a corner unit, all rooms are bathed in natural sunlight, with incredible sunset views in the living and dining areas.  This apartment was perfect for the family reunion we had planned, and I can certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a large apartment in downtown Boston!"
8814105,69469869,2016-04-11,60402036,Dominic,Great apartment. Amazing views. Very spacious

6296656,34225222,2015-06-06,26778333,Arzu,Jason hat vorab bereits sehr ausführliche Informationen gegeben. Er war sehr hilfsbereit und sehr freundlich. Er hat immer sofort geantwortet und für Eventualitäten zahlreiche Kontakte angegeben.
6296656,35252053,2015-06-16,30479859,Jodi,"We all had a fantastic vacation to Boston!  Jason made us feel right at home and had so many wonderful suggestions and tips on where to go and when, places to eat and how to get there!.  He truly wanted to make our visit to Boston the best possible experience and we are all very grateful.  We are now avid Uber users thanks to you!  The apartment is beautiful and was perfect for the 4 of us.  The bedrooms were spacious and beds felt just like home.  If we ever get a chance to come back to Boston, we would definitely stay at one of their properties and will highly recommend them to anyone looking to stay in Boston.  Thank you so much!!!"
6296656,35425460,2015-06-18,7776860,Marilyn,Jason was great at communicating.  I had 2 colleagues that stayed at this apartment and the whole process was seamless.  They enjoyed the apartment and said it was very comfortable.  Check-in and Check-out were easy with the key system that is set up.
6296656,36122951,2015-06-25,12848512,Jessica,"The apartment is beautiful and cozy. We loved how cool it was, as we were melting away in the Boston heat/humidity. The location is central- lots to do nearby, including some nice parks, and only a 15 min walk to the red line train. My only complaint is the difficulty of parking in the neighbourhood."
6296656,37239932,2015-07-05,36804648,佳瑜,Jason is so nice. He invited us to have BBQ with his family to celebrate  the holiday.The house is great and comfortable!
6296656,38127454,2015-07-13,33497261,Mark,We had a great experience staying at Jason's flat. The location was great. The rooms were great. And all of the amenities were great. There was nothing more we could of asked for in our home base for exploring Boston.
6296656,38553739,2015-07-16,37725793,Ted,"We stayed for three fun filled days visiting colleges with my daughters and seeing clients. The place was absolutely fabulous and Jason was a great host. As pretty as the pictures showed, brand new and very convenient to everywhere. I would rent it again and you should too!"
6296656,39031581,2015-07-20,34429226,Diana,"We loved our stay in Boston!  We utilized two floors of this apartment building and both exceeded expectations.  The units were clean, well-equiped, and everything felt brand new.  Items were made available in each unit, such as coffee, extra towels, etc., in order to ensure that our stay was comfortable.  The neighborhood was safe and offered lots of amentities.  When street parking was unavailable, a public lot about a block away met our needs completely.  Jason checked in with us when we arrived and then several times over the course of our stay.  He was friendly and helpful, and made us feel as though we were a priority during our stay.  We would definitely stay in both of these units again and highly recommend this Host!"
6296656,40252423,2015-07-29,37926764,Jason,Traveling to Boston last week was made very easy by Jason and team.  Not only was this everything that he stated it would be in the description but the level of customer service that he provided was top notch.  Wonderful new apartment in the heart of South Boston.  Very convenient location.  I would stay in any property that Jason had available.  Very responsive and professional.
6296656,40992607,2015-08-03,39024071,Katherine,"Jason's description of the apartment was spot on.  Very clean.  The neighborhood is nice.  The apartment overlooks an intersection, with good people watching.  A great coffee shop is just down the street."

6296656,43525994,2015-08-20,36303527,Colin,"The entire experience, from the booking at the start to departing at the end, was, simply, flawless."
Jason replied to messages lightning-fast.  My booking was accepted within minutes and all of my subsequent enquiries were addressed very efficiently. The house manual was comprehensive but very readable,with information about all logistic aspects of the apartment and its surroundings clearly laid out. The house rules,which there were but a few,were very sensible and easy to follow.,,
The whole apartment building was dust-free,just like an upper-end hotel. The appliances were easy to use. The powerful a/c was adjustable keeping the apartment comfortable at all times. There was even a coin-operated washing and drying machine in the apartment building with complimentary laundry soap and bleach. In fact,one of their staff went so far to give me quarters for free to do my laundry. Hahaha.,,,
There were plenty of restaurants (Mexican,Chinese,Italian,American,etc.) all within easy walking distances from the apartment. Some of these opened until after midnight. I also walked to a CVS and a 7-11 for my daily necessities.,
The neighbourhood was quiet and felt safe. At any rate the bedrooms were located away from the streets so it was tranquil at night.,,,,,
Everything in the apartment was so well organised that I had no questions to ask Jason during our stay. Jason and I nevertheless met once in the apartment and he was a very cheerful,personable,young good-looking man.,,,
We came to Boston for a conference,and the Boston Convention Centre was 5 minutes uber-ride from the apartment on the roads of the quiet residential district of South Boston. Compared with many of my colleagues who had to endure the pricier hotels in the busier parts of Boston,my choice of staying in Jason's comfortable apartment was definitely a right one.,,,
"Thank you Jason.\"",,,,,

6296656,44473196,2015-08-26,24084841,Lorena,"Jason's apartment is beautifully renovated and is exactly like the pictures. We got to learn the area in and around South Boston, and either Uber'ed into downtown or walked to the JFK Presidential library which everyone visiting Boston should go and visit. The apartment was exactly what we needed after being tourists during the day. We walked to dinner in the neighborhood and picked up light groceries close by for light breakfasts. Highly recommend the apartment especially because of Jason's hospitality and professionalism so we hope he expands his business to other cities soon!"
6296656,45298165,2015-09-01,36310644,Kwannie,"Nice place to stay. Good environment. There is a coffee machine and capsule. But internet can be used only in the living room. Towel, shampoo and soap are provided in this place so u dont have to carry lots of stuffs when u come here."
6296656,45722108,2015-09-05,41769169,Elspeth,"This was a beautifully renovated apartment in a part of Boston, South Boston, that may not be well known to tourists.  It was both urban and quiet and very comfortable for our family of three.  There is bus service right outside the door, but the T is a relatively long walk away.  There are a few excellent restaurants right nearby.  Jason was a helpful host, easy to communicate with.  He arranged parking for us (additional cost) right behind the building."
6296656,46067406,2015-09-07,39547778,洋,This apartment is so so so great!!

The neighborhood was a great location to stay in for our time at the conference center. There were plenty of food options on our walk from the apartment to the conference center.,,,,,
"I would definitely stay here again.\"",,,,,
6296656,47288768,2015-09-17,1992995,Dalia,"Had a truly perfect stay. The apartment is immaculate and stylish, the beds are super comfortable and the location is ideal. Jason was totally fantastic, responsive and charming. We are coming back next month as we loved it so much, looking forward!"
6296656,48398916,2015-09-26,37325374,Andrew,"Hands down the best airbnb property of our stay. My wife, parents and I stayed in the 1st floor apartment for 3 nights and it was exactly as photographed and even better in person. The apartment is finished to an extremely high standard and everything is spotlessly clean and comfortable. Whilst we didn't meet Jason he was fantastic in providing pre-arrival information and contacting us during and after our stay to see how things were. The beds were really comfortable and rooms peaceful to sleep in. The kitchen area was well-stocked with all the essentials we needed for our stay and the bathroom had shampoo, conditioner and shower gel provided - simple, but appreciated considerations for guests staying at the property. We ate locally two of the evenings - in Portabello Italian restaurant further up the street and Stats sports bar and were able to buy a few grocery items at nearby shops for breakfasts each day."
Fortunately for us we had the pleasure and good-timing to be able to take Jason up on the offer of a sail with his father Larry on 'Kayla' and what an amazing day that was. Larry is a fantastic guy,so knowledgeable and friendly and this was the perfect way to see Boston. Larry provided drinks and a delicious lunch for the four of us and we really appreciated him taking the time to spend a few hours hosting our family. This was one of the highlights of our trip and something we will never forget. Jason and his family are fabulous hosts and a real credit to Airbnb - I would be confident that any of their properties would offer visitors a really positive,comfortable and welcoming experience in Boston. Thank you once again from us all!,,,

6296656,51663457,2015-10-22,407218,Simone,"Jason's place is fantastic! The pictures don't do the apartment justice - it so impressive in person (not to mention super clean). It has everything you need for a comfy stay away from home. I was in town for business, and wished I would have had more time to spend at the apartment. The neighborhood is very cute and safe, with a bunch of coffee shops, restaurants, cute boutiques and shops in walking distance. I went for a long walk each morning, and fell in love with the architecture of the homes in the area. It was a convenient location from the Convention Center, where I was spending my days. I would def recommend staying at Jason's place. He responded to each text and email super quickly, and was able to answer any questions we had. I look forward to staying here again the next time I'm in Boston."
6296656,51870552,2015-10-24,32924339,Katie,Jason was awesome to work with. The condo is amazing and absolutely beautiful. Just like the photos.

6296656,57934141,2015-12-30,12305003,Rachel,"Jason was everything you want in a host - responsive, detail-oriented and personable.  The apartment was just as described, and ideal for a family or two couples.  The location is smack in the middle of Southie - steps to coffee shops, restaurants, pubs and local transit to town.  Had plenty of towels, pillows, blankets and everything you need for a few nights' stay.  It's brand new and was VERY clean! Even laundry on the first floor.   I would absolutely stay there again and highly recommend to anyone for a short or long-term stay."

Communication was very easy and I never once felt out of the loop about our itinerary or access to the house. Jason was reachable during our entire stay but he also respected our space and privacy. The location was great as well; there were plenty of coffee shops and restaurants right down the block! The apartment itself is beautiful and clean, it felt as though we were the first guests ever. Everything worked perfectly and the house was fully stocked. I would certainly re-book here on my next visit, you should too."
6296656,61510396,2016-02-05,21796035,Amy,"Thank you so much Robert for letting our staff stay in your lovely home. They felt very welcomed and we send many thanks from our Building Blocks company in Manchester, England."

Also, if you run, it's easy to get to the coast in a matter of minutes. Perfect for our needs and far more affordable than multiple hotel rooms. Thanks Jason!"
6296656,70638730,2016-04-19,32090793,Natalie,"Jason was the host everyone hopes to get when renting an Airbnb! Our experience in his apartment and in Southie was absolutely amazing. The apartment was an incredible comfortable place to come home to each day and it had everything we needed. Jason went out of his way to make sure we all felt comfortable during our stay. If you are traveling to Boston, I highly recommend staying here or at one of Jason's other rentals. Hope to be back soon!"
6296656,72012949,2016-04-30,64544979,Govind,"I decided to try air bnb for the first time and that was a very good decision.  Jason's apartment is very clean and comfortable with 2 independent bedrooms, comfortable beds, closet space and a kitchen with all required amenities.  Bathroom has extra towels as well."
Check in was really smooth and directions were simple to follow for a first time user like me.  Furthermore,Jason was prompt in responding to messages and had provided additional contact information just in case.  The host had it all planned to perfection.,,,,
The location is very good with public transportation and acces to downtown/convention center.  Parking is free on the front street from 8PM - 8AM.  During daytime you can park for free behind the building on the street. (you don't need resident permit to park),,,,,

6296656,75161995,2016-05-19,37471191,Jonathan,It was great to stay in Jason's while staying in Boston.
Jason was very thoughtful to send me information about the place and neighbourhood before arrival. I was able to check in following Jason's instructions given beforehand. I didn't have to wait for someone to hand me the keys to get in.,,,,,
The location is in great neighbourhood,a quiet residential area.  A convenience store was just across the street. Virtually everywhere in Boston is reachable in about 20-30 min at most.,,,,
"I would stay at Jason's place next time visiting Boston.\"",,,,,
6296656,75745143,2016-05-22,53647927,Natalie,"This was our first air bnb experience, and what can I say? Jason was the perfect host, the location was perfect, and the condo looked exactly like the pictures."
I'm not familiar with Boston at all and took a chance with choosing this location,and I'm glad I did. It's a quaint little community of young professionals that are starting to move in and take over the area,mixed with the local Irish population that have been there for years. Everyone walks to bars or restaurants and there's plenty of those around! There's also a 7/11 a block from the house where you can purchase any basic essentials and a dunks across the street.,,,
All in all it was a great experience,my only complaint would be that if you choose the very back room and you're  staying there on a weekend,do not expect to sleep in or peace and quiet.,,,
Some of the neighbors are pretty loud and love to blast music and talk till 7 am. So you fall asleep hearing them and wake up hearing them.,,,,,
It is a city though,"so it's a pretty easy fix: take ear plugs \"",,,,
6296656,76440482,2016-05-27,60402869,Stacy,"Jason was absolutely accommodating and a fantastic host. We had a slight hiccup with the wifi at one point, but he was on it in no time at all. The apartment was spacious, cozy and well appointed. The bed was super comfy. The Keurig and all of the amenities in the bathroom was a nice touch. I would highly recommend! If I come through Boston again, I would absolutely stay here again."
6296656,77056812,2016-05-30,1504337,Jamie,"Our stay was excellent! The apt was super clean, the beds were extremely comfortable and the living room was open & nice to hang out in. The HBO was a plus so we didn't have to miss Game of Thrones! Jason was attentive and fast to reply to our questions and we really appreciated the early check-in. The neighborhood was 8-10 minutes Uber ride into North End & South End where we mainly dined & hung out. Southie had great deal diners for brunch & was an easy an walk to the harbor to check out the water. Will definitely book again!"

I felt like being at home and I even got a room with air-condition, which was quite important considering the hot tempretures outside. The bed was comfortable and also a desk with chair is in the room. The apartment has two nice porches with tables and chairs, where I had some good discussions with Dan. All in all I can recommend Dan's place and he is a perfect host!"
321328,1585053,2012-06-28,2726746,Rebecca And Joe,Dan was a great host!! I would stay with him again without question.  Fabulous breakfast and Dan's daughter is cute as a button. greatly enjoyed his conversation.
321328,2692982,2012-10-22,3731539,Ayumi,Dan was great host!!! I really love his house. He invited me to go to park by his bike. It was so nice experience for me!
321328,3107928,2012-12-17,1947586,Larry,"I stayed two nights at Dan's house.  Great room, comfortable bed, delicious pancake breakfast, and an endless supply of good humor and unique insights.  By the way, it's a 10-minute walk to Roslindale Village and really great restaurants.  It's less than 10 minutes to the Arboretum, where you could easily get lost in the beauty for an afternoon.  I would definitely recommend Dan."
321328,3402052,2013-01-23,4538449,Sidney,"The location was perfect for our visit, and Dan was very friendly and welcoming when we arrived.  We were visiting with nearby family and only slept at this location, and since Dan was out of the house for the weekend we visited, this stay felt very private and quiet."
321328,4197659,2013-04-17,2859309,Joel,"It was a great place to stay.  If you need a small space in a quiet neighborhood, I would highly recommend.  The room we had was small but Dan spent most of the time out of the apartment so we had the place to ourselves which was a welcome surprise.  No trouble with parking and Dan is a pretty good chess player."
321328,21053735,2014-10-10,2334541,Aaron,"Dan was a great host! He was very helpful and friendly, and was fun to chat with over coffee in the morning. The room was super clean and exactly as expected!"

Also the location is very convenient if you have a car. Only 15 min away from the city and such a beautiful neighborhood.
321328,32433232,2015-05-17,33156405,Susan,I really appreciated Dan's flexibility. He has excellent communication and a very friendly personality. He definitely made my stay easy.
321328,43587458,2015-08-20,41656104,James,"Dan was a wonderful host. He is obviously very knowledgeable about how AirBnB works. He was very responsive in communications and made me feel that I would have no trouble accessing the room. Everything went very well. He is a busy contractor but he definitely took the time to get acquainted, to see if I had any special needs, and was very concerned about making sure I was comfortable by asking feedback questions several times. If I was there when he was leaving, he was sure to check in before departure."
321328,51866479,2015-10-24,37309745,Rachel And Marian,Very welcoming host. He was prompt with communication. He was there when I arrived to greet and orient me to the house. He is very friendly and outgoing and pleasant to talk to.

10311094,89426376,2016-07-28,82872887,Patrick,"The bathrooms are plentiful.  The view is breathtaking. The location is walking distance to famous parks and landmarks. The air conditioning was confusing. One room was freezing cold, and the rest of the house was hot and we finally figured it out in the morning. The elevators are slow and very small and the walk up is long but it is worth it. Every time someone uses the Elevator in the building you will know it by its hammering sound. craftsmanship of the apartment is bad. Stove burners doesn't lite. Missing windows blinds in all rooms and white paper blinds expect the awake up at 5am."
6764572,35280556,2015-06-16,12957062,Lucie,"Jon and Margrit were amazing hosts! They agreed to host us last minute which was a huge help in our scrambled plans.

They gave us a lot of suggestions on things to visit, place to eat at Boston. The breakfast they provide is fantastic.

They were both very helpful with directions around the city and provided us with a lot to do!! Also, their home is absolutely beautiful!! The 1880's Victorian feel really puts you in Old Boston, and allows for a more interesting visit of the city... It's also right next to the Orange Line! We comfortably saw the entire city by train and foot. I've never been so content. We highly recommend that you stay with the MacGowans!"

She had lots of maps for those who are used to using paper maps ;) they were helpful! The AC in the room wasn't cold enough but Margrit left the next room with stronger AC opened so we get cool air. Overall, it was not a bad stay at all!"

The 19th century house, the Germany cultural furniture and the lovely hosts, all reminded us of our very wonderful travel to Rothenburg ob der tauber years ago. It's also a pleasure to hear Jon and Margrit talking about those interesting stories of travels and of course expertise in their realms, which is a natural harmony as we expected Boston and it's people to be. I guess it's the best part of this Airbnb experience, besides price and convenience:)"

The house is so big, it took me a whole week of getting use to! (I meant to compliment!) But soon after that, we can only be thankful that we have the fortune to be staying there. The house is well equipped and conveniently situated within 5 minutes short walk to the T in Jamaica Plain.. It is in close proximity - ~8 minutes walk to whole food and various restaurants on center street. We experienced the first winter snow and subzero temperature of Boston in this house without problem. I highly recommend this house as perfect home away from home for your next visit of Boston!"

Such a beautiful old house with plenty of space, we really enjoyed having breakfast out on the deck overlooking the garden. Margrit gave us some advice on where to to go in Boston on our first evening when we were very jet-lagged, so we went down to the harbour which was a perfect choice and very easy to get to on the train."
The area around the house is very interesting and a nice contrast to the busy city. We took Margrit's advice again and had a fantastic meal at The Frogmore just a few minutes' walk from the house - highly recommended.,,,,,
We drove from the airport and had no problem finding a parking space on the street but we could have used their driveway if necessary. It's only a few minutes' pleasant walk from the train station (be careful crossing the bike path!) and very easy to get in and out of the city,but it's uphill to get to the house from there so that might not be the ideal way to arrive if you have heavy bags.,,,,

We walked into a room that was still dirty from the previous guests - trash on the floor, dirty towels on the chair - even though we showed up exactly when we said we would. Our host showed us the room (cleaned up the mess then), gave us the key, and gave us fresh towels... and that was the extent of the interaction. He didn't show us where anything was, he didn't acknowledge us at ALL the next morning, he didn't offer us any breakfast (a continental breakfast was described as being included). We waited around for an hour and finally just left the keys on the nightstand. For $120 a night, my husband and I expected a little more hospitality, and at the very least, a clean room. We will not be staying here again when we come to Boston."

We were on the 14th floor and the unit was clean and tidy, with wonderful views of Boston. We certainly would use Mike in the future.  As a matter of fact, we've already looked into Mike's offerings in Miami Beach."

The room was clean.,,,,,
"The common parts are not the best but absolutely functional.\"",,,,,
3765289,19891203,2014-09-20,3624892,Sebastian,I would NEVER EVER book this place again!
Sure,for this price you can't expect much. So it's absolutely fair that the rooms furnishing was very basic and the place in general a bit worn. You'll hear the nearby I 93 in most of the rooms but since it's mostly just some background noise it's totally ok.,,,,
I could also life with the fact that there are several other people living in this place even though it can be annoying if you have to wait to get into the bathroom.,,,,,
What I can't accept,though,is the dirty bathroom. It was obvious that it hadn't been cleaned for a LONG time: mold around the bathtub and the ceiling,piles of dust in the corners and urine and other stains on the toilet lid.,,
Right at our arrival (on Sunday) we brought this to our hosts attention. She replied that a cleaning person comes once a week (on Monday) and we should check again. When we came back Monday evening it was obvious that the cleaning person had been there since most of the 15+ shampoo bottles had been moved onto the shelf. But the bathroom wasn't any cleaner.,,,,,
Even a complaint to Airbnb didn't make any difference.,,,,,
"Btw. everybody who saw our pictures of the bathroom was shocked.\"",,,,,
10233104,64571606,2016-03-05,60969021,Amber,"Ricardo was a great host, he was sensitive to our needs and very responsive. Got back to us very quickly on short notice. Very friendly, and he made sure we had everything we needed. He was also very knowledgeable about the city of Boston and everything the area has to offer. The location is extremely convenient, close to the airport, downtown, and public transportation. The apartment has a beautiful view of the ocean and is exactly what it looks like in the pictures. The room was very clean, the bed really comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed. I would recommend this place for any travelers."
10233104,65438312,2016-03-13,41021941,Kellie,"I have never stayed in a hostel so I don't know how it compares to others. The room was just as pictured  and was clean.  The location was convenient, close to subway and a nice view of the city.  Ricardo was very nice and helpful.  There is only one quite small bathroom, though, which can be inconvenient with multiple people staying at the hostel."
10233104,67614087,2016-03-30,58416788,Karl,Everything was fine! Thanks a lot!
10233104,67973159,2016-04-01,48298042,Yiying,Ricardo is really nice and apartment
10233104,68038735,2016-04-01,10942382,Subba,Not very good
10233104,68239433,2016-04-03,9351069,Beth,My husband and I enjoyed our stay in Ricardo's apartment/hostel. Ricardo was very quick to respond to any emails and welcomed us when we arrived.
The room was as pictured - simple yet spacious,the bed was comfortable (the mattress was brand new).  The shared kitchen and bathroom were fine - it was nice to have a fridge available to keep food though we didn't do any cooking while there.,,,,
The third floor of the house was under construction,but we were out during the day and if we wanted to sleep-in in the morning,we just put earplugs in and it didn't disturb us.,,,
"The location was great - only a short walk from the subway and only 1 stop to the downtown/harbor area. There are some nice restaurants nearby and we felt very safe walking around anytime day or night.\"",,,,,
10233104,68470093,2016-04-05,1595787,Cobun,"This place was just as described, very hostel-like with the bare minimum of amenities but comfortable enough for a short stay. Ricardo was great, super responsive to all of our questions. There was street parking available and the subway was close by for access to other areas of Boston. Eastie doesn't have a lot to do, but it's right across from the exciting parts of Boston, so the location was convenient. The shared bathroom and kitchen was stocked with necessary supplies. The walls are very thin, so I would recommend bringing ear plugs if you don't want to hear your neighbors too much, but we slept great with the ear plugs in!"
10233104,69794762,2016-04-13,54854784,Antje,"Very clean and Central Place with walking distance to Airport Gates. Nevertheless no Noise from Planes. The host lives in the Basement and Virtually Assists At any Problem. However, currently there is a Building lot in the neighborhood which makes Long sleeping in the Morning impossible After 9am. The Walls Are also Quite thin."
10233104,70391798,2016-04-17,33206164,Véronique,"Very nice hostel, well localed! Thank you Richardo!"
10233104,70736401,2016-04-20,62542613,José Domingos,O Ricardo foi impecável. Respondeu sempre as minhas solicitações.
Gostei do apartamento,em especial da sua localização muito próximo da estação de metro e a apenas uma estação do centro de Boston,cidade de que gostei imenso.,,,
O apartamento tem casa de banho partilhada,mas bastante próxima e sempre disponivel e a cozinha é muito bem equipada.,,,,
Apenas um aspeto a corrigir a cama do quarto em que fiquei era demasiado mole (o colchão) e estava um pouco inclinada.,,,,,
Para os preços praticados em Boston esteve bem.,,,,,
Obrigado Ricardo pela simpatia.,,,,,
Nota:Além do mais fala português ou espanholes.,,,,,

10233104,71546145,2016-04-26,41505505,Dan,"The absolute best thing Ricardo did was make himself available via chat. There were several times I had questions and needed help and he was there to do so even until quite late in the evening. The neighborhood was great and I loved the food nearby. Definitely recommend the Columbian cafe nearby. The listing is accurate and has the most important info in caps: hostel and shared bath. Overall I'm very satisfied with my experience and would recommend it to anyone, but do keep in mind the walls are thin so you may need to ask Ricardo to have other guests keep it down if they're too noisy (which he will do and is very accommodating about)."
10233104,73361088,2016-05-08,48296392,Alex,"Ricardo was a great host . The apartment/ hostel is very well price compare to any other hostel/hotel In Boston. The location is great , just a very short walk to subway station, only 5-10 from downtown or the airport. I would highly recommend staying at Ricardo place for anyone visiting Boston."
10233104,74286741,2016-05-14,64968469,Felipe,"Ricardo was very thoughtful and considerate with my parents. He also did his best to accommodate my request to change dates last minute, charging a reasonable fee. The place is kept clean. No luxuries but comfortable and conveniently located near the metro."
10233104,74938250,2016-05-17,7522134,Brenda,"Ricardo was an excellent host, he was always available with our inquiries. Building is just one block from the subway, 1 stop away from downtown, it is very convenient. Location is very good, neighborhood is quiet and there's a waterfront park one block away where you can shoot a great panoramic of Boston downtown. Room was clean and the bed was very comfy. Would definitely recommend it."
10233104,75471956,2016-05-21,68622628,Mike,The room is great and the location is very close to the subway!

10233104,76291206,2016-05-26,67127998,Mark,My girlfriend and I stayed in the hostel. It was very clean and just what we expected. Ricardo was there when we arrived and was very helpful. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place in Boston
10233104,76905652,2016-05-29,72755497,Ronja,Gute Beschreibung und freundlicher Kontakt gehabt als wir ankamen. Die Nachbarn waren alle nett und hilfsbereit!
10233104,77988000,2016-06-04,69297271,Shannon,We had a nice stay at Ricardo's hostel. The room and bathrooms were clean and the building was quiet. The security  door made us feel safe and independent. We loved that it was suck a quick walk to the train and very nice to be only one stop from both the airport and downtown.
10233104,78519590,2016-06-07,74504364,Shruti,Neighborhood is really good. Very close to blue line.
Also close to financial and seaport districts.,,,,,

10233104,80812269,2016-06-19,1327055,Simon,"Ricardo n'était pas présent lors de notre arrivée, mais il nous avait averti et nous n'avons pas eu de problème pour entrer."
Pour la chambre,on ne peut pas dire que c'est le plus bel espace que nous ayons visité. Pour le prix que nous avons payé,nous nous attendions à mieux. Tout de même,puisque nous avions en tête de visiter la ville,nous avons profité amplement de ce weekend. Nous avions amené nos vélos et nous conseillons à tous les voyageurs de parcourir la ville de Boston de cette manière.,
Finalement,Ricardo a pensé à un système d'affichage pour le stationnement. C'est une bonne idée,seulement,quand nous avons voulu quitter,une voiture était garée devant la nôtre et personne n'avait laissé de coordonnées pour qu'on puisse le rejoindre. Il s'est avéré,après que nous ayons cogné à toutes les portes de l'auberge et dérangé les gens
Ceci dit,"Boston est une ville charmante et le quartier de East Boston est rempli de restos et de pâtisseries latinos qu'il vaut la peine de visiter.\"",,,,
10233104,82398844,2016-06-27,29753671,Samuel,Super bon rapport qualité/prix! Bien situé à une seule station de métro du centre-ville.

10233104,84284784,2016-07-06,56536090,Greta,Ricardo promptly answered our questions and provided a very accurate description of the accommodations. A three minute walk to the subway with one stop away from the airport and downtown was awesome.
10233104,86494269,2016-07-16,81137421,Rebecca,"We visited on a hot/humid weekend and the room was hot! There was a fan, but this room in particular does not cool much. The listing never said it had a/c so It may have just been bad luck the our visit was so hot. The location was great and I would consider staying again in a cooler season."
10233104,87597789,2016-07-21,28010073,Moritz,"The host gave complete information on how to enter the place and use the wifi. The room is ok but we paid € 84 per night which is certainly too much: The pictures don't show the stains on the floor and ceiling, nor do they show the state of the bathroom which could be more clean (also, the one on the pictures is not the one for that room). The room itself has a considerable slope (!) towards the door. Didn't use the kitchen. There is a construction site next doors so the noise level is kinda high. The location has a good connection to public transport."

Nos sentimos muy cómodos, los únicos inconvenientes fueron el tamaño de la pieza, el colchón no era muy bueno y la falta de aire acondicionado. Todo el resto tal y como esta en las fotos."
10233104,95578439,2016-08-20,10610552,Choon,The listing was exactly as described and shown in the photos. The room is basic and suitable for a few nights stay - there is no A/C so it can get very hot.

Das Zimmer ist geräumig und sauber! Leider wird in der Nachbarschaft gerade gebaut,somit ist es morgens lärmig.,,,,
Ricardo kam gerade von einer grösseren Reise nach Hause,als ich gegangen bin. Er ist sehr nett und offen! Ebenso seine Familie! Der Weg zu seinem Apartement wurde mir super beschrieben!,,,,

11295065,78630166,2016-06-08,36145522,Rolf,The flat is pretty nice and super located in South Boston. You can find all you need close by and public transport quite accessible within few minutes walk.

8720718,51380109,2015-10-19,34689417,Samantha,"We were so happy when we checked into this little studio which felt more like a boutique hotel than a spare bedroom. Riyo put effort into lots of extra details like prepping a fantastic guide book, which included helpful info about the neighbourhood and the city overall. It's very close to the subway which is really easy to navigate; we even got a free ride there from the airport using the Silver Line bus, which was an added bonus."
We really appreciated all the extra details like the yummy snacks and nice products. Everything was really clean and smelled very fresh. Riyo was super fast at replying to messages. We were sad that we didn't end up meeting to thank her in person and tell her how much we really appreciated her style!,,,,,
So,"thank you Riyo (& family). We had a great time and would certainly return if ever in Boston again!\"",,,,

8720718,52368168,2015-10-28,45870831,Yi-Lun,"The awesome private room is at the back yard of the house, and the furniture and electrical appliances in it are all new. The decoration is gorgeous, the bed is comfortable, and the private bathroom is clean. Riyo is very considerate; she even prepare much fruit, snacks, and drinks for the guests. It only takes 4-5 minutes to walk to the metro Stony Brook. It was a wonderful experience of BnB, and hope we can stay here again when visiting Boston next time."
8720718,52524027,2015-10-30,40311322,Tanya,"Riyo's place is absolutely incredible!! My friend and I stayed there for two days and it was the most relaxing and comfortable experience. The studio was super clean, comfy and she really went out of her way to make sure we had everything we need. She included a lot of fun ideas and recommendations for us and was very attentive if we had any questions. She even offered to mail me back my necklace that I forgot! We highly recommend staying here while in Boston. We know we will if we come back."

8720718,53201304,2015-11-06,21981648,Yasmin,My boyfriend stayed here for 2 nights. It was really convenient if what you need is a place to sleep and a plan to be out in Boston the rest of the time. It's about a 4 minute walk from the T and takes about 18 minutes to be in downtown Boston. If driving there's free parking around the area so would be convenient. Riyo was very friendly-- would definitely recommend!
8720718,53365792,2015-11-08,20088179,Daniel,Riyo and her family were unbelievable!! Couldn't have asked for a better place. Ideal location. Striking distance to everything!! Recommend this place to anyone looking for privacy and that feeling of being at home .

This place went above and beyond my expectations!"
8720718,54598863,2015-11-22,46108389,Christina,"This was our first AirBnB rental and we were so impressed. Riyo, the Host, was very nice and accommodating. The neighborhood feels very safe and it's a short walk to the T. (only 12 mins to China Town). What makes this rental great is the privacy with the separate entrance and private bath. Also, Riyo provided water and snacks for the room which was so appreciated. The studio itself was spotless, stylish, and comfortable."
8720718,54990641,2015-11-27,43641294,Zhongwang,"It is a great place to live, we lived there four days and really enjoy it."
First,the room is very clean,fully functional with powerful air condition. It also have a private bathroom,microwave,refrigerator,and TV with a lot of channels.
Second,it is very close to the origin line of the subway (1 min walk),making the trip very convenience. Quite and safe neighbors.,,,
Third,Riyo is a very nice person,she warmed the room before we came in (imaging it is the late night of November in Boston). Served a lot of snacks and soda. There is also a note book with full of useful travel information collected.,,,
"We really appreciate that Riyo shared this nice place with us. \"",,,,,
8720718,55404978,2015-12-01,11786687,Julia-Katharina,"We had a great time staying at Riyo's and her family's place and can totally recommend it. It is clean, new, has the perfect size to stay for a trip and is located just a few minutes away from the subway. Unfortunately we didn't met her personally, because we didn't want to disturb during thanksgiving celebration. She answered directly to my requests and we found snacks and some great and helpful recommondations for the neighbourhood from her in a book. Thank you for having us :)"

The room and bathroom were clean, the bed had a very good mattress, the TV was good, and there was fresh fruit and other snacks when we arrived. Riyo was friendly and easily accessible."
If you have a lot of baggage or are planning a stay of more than a few days,this place may not be the best choice as it is quite small and there is no closet,table,"or couch and only one small chair.\"",,

Jamaica Plains is a great area. The main street offered a variety of food options and some solid bars.,,,,,
The studio was clean and well stocked. It sports a small refrigerator and microwave,"but no other food related amenities beyond that. Filled up water bottles I brought from the bathroom sink tap.\"",,,,

8720718,62269767,2016-02-13,36574927,Alvand,"This is an A+ listing. I have used Airbnb all around the world and this was by far the best experience I have had. Riyo was extremely good at communicating, very helpful for anything I needed while I was there, the apartment was very clean, and even had snacks and drinks! I had the luxury of having my own entrance but also having my host near by if I needed anything."
On top of all that it is a two minute walk to the metro. If you are looking to stay in Boston and are 1 or 2 people,"this is the place to book. I will certainly try and stay here again if come back to Boston. \"",,,,

We were impressed by the the efficient use of space.  Not a square inch was wasted.  It is only two blocks from the subway and we had a parking space.  Best of all we got to meet Riyo and her family, who were most friendly and welcoming.  We would certainly come back and recommend them to anyone."
8720718,63446988,2016-02-22,52654648,Cassie,The host canceled this reservation 129 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The place is in a wonderful, quiet neighborhood, close to the T. She went far above and beyond my expectations for the place, including an array of snacks and bottled water for us for our stay. She even made sure to include a neat little binder, including maps of the area, and suggestions of places to visit in the area. Riyo is a wonderful host, and is greatly accommodating.  I couldn't commend or her place more! Five stars just isn't enough for her and this beautiful studio."

A few hours before I arrived, I receive a text with pictures and details of how to navigate to his place, a nice touch for unfamiliar territory. A cute little room with everything I needed and a note from Riyo reminding me if I needed anything to not hesitate to reach out."
If I could sum up my experience in one phrase,"it would be \"\"True Hospitality\"\"",,,,

Everything was clean and exactly as described. These touches made for a warm and inviting atmosphere. We only ran into each other when first arriving, but there was certainly a sense of availability if needed. My first airbnb experience, and a great one all around. The room was exceptional, 2min walk to the T - perfect."
8720718,67392792,2016-03-29,52783172,Max,Riyo was an amazing host! This is a perfect place to stay if you want to explore Boston. Her studio was clean and she even provided us with snacks and bottled water. What an exceptional experience and great host! Highly recommended.

It was exceptionally clean, quiet and packed to the brim with helpful resources for touring Boston and the Jamaica Plain neighbourhood. We truly appreciated all of the small things that enhanced our experience - from snacks and tea to toiletries and umbrellas to use in the rain. Jamaica Plain is a lovely neighbourhood, with great restaurants (Tres Gatos and Ula were our favourites) and very close to the Samuel Adams brewery.  The studio is only a 3 minute walk to the T station (no more than 20 minutes to all of the major sites in Boston and 35 to Cambridge). We would stay at Riyo's studio if ever in Boston again and would happily recommend it to anyone!"
8720718,69235327,2016-04-10,8936232,Robin,Our host absolutely delightful and made us feel very welcome even came out to welcome us late at night as we made our way on foot in under 5 minutes from The station.   Pleasant leafy suburban location.  She even sent us on our way with a pack of fresh fruit for our onward journey.

8720718,70043552,2016-04-15,19756532,Clarissa,"Walking into the cute little room Riyo has to share was breath taking. She made us feel welcome with a personal handwritten note. She made herself available if needed. The space was perfect for two people. She had everything in that space from lint rollers, hair dryer, towels and even a pair of scissors. The snacks she provides for us was very generous. Wifi was a little difficult to have a good connection, but that didn't bother me at all. The neighborhood is extremely safe and just about 2-3 blocks away from the train. If I decide to come back to Boston, I will most definitely be staying with Riyo!"
8720718,70666941,2016-04-19,45159658,Mary,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Riyo and couldn't have asked for a better experience!  Jamaica Plain is a neat neighborhood, and getting to downtown Boston was very convenient being only several blocks from public transportation.  Riyo was a wonderful host.  She was friendly, accommodating and even offered to give us a ride when we needed to be downtown in the early AM.  The space was great for two people, and included everything we needed for a multi-night stay.  We would definitely stay here again, and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Boston!  "

8720718,73856190,2016-05-10,41871612,Carol,"Quiet spot tucked into a charming residential area in JP.  So close to the Stony Brook T station.  Riyo and her family were very welcoming and ready to help with any needs.  Studio was already pretty stocked with all the amenities, so hardly needed to ask for anything.  City Feed and Supply Co-op had great food staples and wonderful coffee just a block away.  It was amazing that so much could be squeezed into such a cozy space.  Amazingly fast and consistent wifi service since we still needed to be connected for work.  Thanks, Riyo for a great stay."

8720718,78396033,2016-06-06,51452058,Lauren,"From the moment we got there to the moment we left, our stay was perfect at Riyo's. We arrived a little early since our flight landed earlier than expected. Riyo was gracious enough to let us drop off our luggage first so we could go explore the city without having to lug everything around. Everything inside the room was perfect and had all the little things that really made it feel like home from snacks to toiletries. Riyo even had a variety of brochures and maps of JP and Boston. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the JP and Boston area. Not only is the room perfect, but it's so easy to hop on the T into the city from this location. Not to mention Riyo was a very kind and welcoming host. More than a 5 star rating all around."
8720718,79007280,2016-06-10,57728137,Maya,"Great location, easy commute to city Centre by subway like 3min walk. Quiet neighborhood right by charming Jamaica plain.

A couple of minutes walk to the train and you're in the centre of Boston in about 15-20mins,really easy and the local neighbourhood is lovely - we visited the Sam Adams brewery tour and Doyle 's both very local and a good way to see the Jamaica Plain area. And while you're there get an amazing sandwich from City Feed and Supply just across the street.,,,,

8720718,86871283,2016-07-17,57672623,Kathryn,We had an excellent 4 night stay in Riyo's lovely suite. This listing is exactly as described and as it looks it the photos and is perfect for a solo traveler or couple.
Before arriving we were sent very clear and helpful directions on how to access the suite and had no problems checking in. There is a binder with info about the city and Riyo was also so kind in offering to help us with anything else we may need to know. The suite is very well maintained and is very clean and welcoming.,,,,,
What made this suite so great for us was the awesome location. Jamaica Plain is a really neat neighborhood to explore with some good food options.

Nestled in a cute, quiet, and safe neighborhood, the train station is only a quick 3 minute walk away. The  room itself was the perfect size for our short stay. The bathroom was clean and updated and the bed was comfortable. What set this airbnb apart from other places we've stayed was the care Riyo took to make us feel so welcome. Riyo stocked a mini fridge full of drinks and had a basket full of snacks for us. After a long day of traveling or exploring the city, this was such a pleasant surprise.

Also, Riyo equipped the apartment with a lot of snacks and material about Boston, several maps and hints, just everything you need as a tourist. The neighborhood was very quite and to my opinion safe. There is a t-station (orange line) which takes about 3 minutes walk from the studio. Of course I would recommend the studio for trourists!"

Host provided plenty of bottled water for us,which was unexpected and very nice. Shower had plenty of water pressure. It was exactly what we hoped for.,,,,
"The subway was a very easy 2 block walk.  And this area was awesome.  We felt very safe everywhere we went.  We took the subway from and to the airport with ease.  We hitched an Uber a few times.

Lá fomos recebidos pela sua esposa que foi muito atenciosa e nos conduziu até o nosso studio. Eu poderia dizer que o espaço é exatamente como nas fotos, e de fato é, porém ao vivo a riqueza de detalhes, o conforto e a cortesia dos anfitriões é ainda maior.

I was very anxious (hoping everything went well, also going one step closer to his leaving home), Lorna was so patient and helped keep me focused.  Staying at Lorna's Garden was like staying with family, in the space and the attention.  I told my husband that we could add Lorna's Garden to our list of places to stay while our son is attending college there."

Wifi and everything worked, although I was unable to get wifi on my PS4 I could still hook it up to the TV. The hallway and apartment had lots of nice incense-y smells going on, which I don't mind, but for someone with allergies you should let let the host know. Thank you Merry! :D"

8956962,77066133,2016-05-30,23067149,Volodymyr,Merry was a nice and friendly host. Her apartment was pretty much as on the photos. Room was clean. Although the neighborhood is a bit noisy. Good choice for a deep sleeper :) Also wifi was not always available. Other than that all was good.
8956962,77996062,2016-06-05,18076876,Akram,Very clean room and apartment and flexible with check in times. The parking is on-street and convenient. There was a Spanish party (from the music) downstairs that went on into the night which is not really in Merry's control but it might be bothersome to others. Every part of the house was super clean and overall wonderful experience. Best part was her friend Ronald told us about where to eat around the house and what to see in Boston. Great guy great vibes!

"The place itself has all the necessary to live the experience of \"\"home\"\"",while providing an ideal platform to explore the city. We stayed at  Sarra´s place for two weeks,and loved the whole experience because we could have both kind of experiences: days at home,with friends,enjoying the pool and watching movies,"and days of exploring the city with a very accessible platform to return and \"\"recharge batteries\"\". Again: I wish there would be larger characters in order to give the precise idea about how AMAZING this place is."
Upon entering,you get a very pleasant feeling of cleanliness that came from the wide lighting and nice aroma of the place.,,,,
Sarra is very kind and generous,she asked us to use what we need from the stuff she has for regular use,of course we tried not to do so,but we liked this touch anyway. The check-in was so easy,and since the first day,she texted us regularly in order to ensure a comfortable staying for us. Next time we come back to Boston

The room was perfect with all of the amenities including a towel rack, luggage rack and sample shampoos! He did a great job decorating and it was very quiet for where it is located. We were just locals looking for a night in town and were pleased he was near both St Anthony's feast and the North St Cafe! Bed was very comforatable, slept well. I am an airbnb host myself and would recommend Will to any guests!"

11873789,78716490,2016-06-08,41660751,Geoffrey,"Garrett was very well organised and we found everything to be as promised. In fact, the photos for this listing don't quite do service to how nice of a place this apartment is. Our schedules didn't overlap so we didn't meet Garrett in person, but he has been responsive by email and the key exchange (via lockbox) was extremely straightforward. I live in the area so was familiar with the neighbourhood: an extremely convenient location for those looking to visit Boston and Cambridge, with very nice local cafes."

The Studio Room was exactly as pictured: pretty, large, bright, fresh and airy, and super comfortable.  The state of the art ceiling fan was quiet; the bathroom looked new.  The fridge in our room was stocked with milk, juice, yogurts, and cereal and coffee, etc., etc., were also provided.  We felt like we were in an actual bed and breakfast."
The neighborhood also couldn't have been better.  First and foremost,it is a quiet place to sleep.  Yay!!!!  Also,the South End of Boston is dotted with fun shops,tree-lined streets with brick townhouses full of character,and some small,lovely
We were within easy walking distance of Copley Square with its magnificent Trinity Church and the Boston Public Library (both not to be missed!) and the Back Bay area with beautiful Commonwealth Boulevard's mansions and greenway.  The T stop to take us into the center of town was even closer and easy to use.,,,,,

Edward's place is gorgeous, immaculate and in the heart of a quintessential south Boston neighborhood.  It is hard to describe how beautiful the place and the setting are.  It is fair to say that there are stairs and the very nicely appointed rooms are on the third level of the home.  I loved being in a neighborhood and within walking distance of so many great restaurants and sights.  I was very busy during my stay - next timeI I would enjoy a chance to talk more with Edward.  He is a Renaissance man of the first order and an avid conversationalist.  Highly recommended."

The room I stayed in was impeccably clean and included a private bath. The south end is my favorite Boston neighborhood and the house sits on a quiet, leafy street. It's a quick walk to the Back Bay Amtrak/T station & Copley Square, not to mention some of the best restaurants are in the area."
6444303,54007991,2015-11-15,16419538,Marilynn,We had a wonderful time in Boston and Edward's home was perfect for our needs. The apartment was clean and well-designed. The neighborhood was safe and close to everything that we wanted to see/visit. I would stay here again in an heartbeat!
The only thing that surprised me was- we had to pay for the laundry. Which is fine,but felt very business-y. I've stayed at several other airbnb homes and this has never been an issue.,,,,

The room was comfortable and a great size even for two. Edward is also incredibly accommodating. I didn't get to meet him until my last day but in the short time that we spoke, he was incredibly friendly and easy to talk to. I couldn't have had a better first Airbnb experience."

It was a delightful experience from the first message until we closed the door. Edward was away, but responded to my messages in a more than timely fashion. He offered step by step directions for transit travel. Let's talk about location, We felt fancy just walking down the streets and more importantly, we felt safe. There were many food options in close proximity to Edward's home. The home is true to the photos- clean, comfortable, and beautifully decorated. The rooftop offers a gorgeous view and it is easily accessible. The room we stayed in had a comfy bed and the sheets/blankets felt like a welcome cocoon of goodness after a day out in the cold. The bathroom - CLEAN!!!"
Edward's place is top notch and if you are in the Boston area,"you should check it out! The only con - we didn't get to meet Edward!! Look forward to staying at Edward's again... \"",,,,

I love the living room and kitchen that is so spacious and a beautiful white piano in the middle. I like Edward's taste which really makes his place great. The bedroom and bathroom are also clean and beautiful. Me and my mom explore Boston by walking all day. Everyday when we came back to this place, we felt like we were back to home. Also, the location is so nice that is so short to anywhere. So many good restaurants and bars nearby. I love here. Honestly, it was a very very nice experience. I definitely will recommend to  anyone who travel to Boston to Edward's airbnb."

Margaret graciously waited for us to arrive late at night and provided clear directions about the house, the neighbourhood and the city.  She made it clear not to hesitate to call her if we needed anything at all.  She even left us some delicious wine to enjoy after our long journey.   The house is bright and comfortable and easily accommodated 2 Moms and 4 teenaged kids.  The neighbourhood is friendly and vibrant and we loved Canto 6 for coffee and baked goods - not to be missed.  We would love to come back in the summer to enjoy Margaret's garden."

Margaret was exceptionally helpful and accommodating, particularly given the difficult circumstances!"
743211,4840699,2013-05-28,4136037,Beck,"We stayed its extended family and our two small children in this house in the Boston suburbs for a long weekend and found it to be perfect for our needs. The immediate area is very pretty, with lots of greenery and beautiful old houses. And while it's not in downtown Boston, it's a very short train trip or drive into the centre of town. It's also within walking distance from some cute cafes and a supermarket."
While our weekend was pretty much rained out,it was handy to have access to the large selection of Netflix movies and tv shows to entertain our preschooler. Margaret also thoughtfully left some fresh milk and bread for us,which was very helpful given we arrived after midnight.,,,
I thoroughly recommend staying at Margaret's house. All communication with her was fast and easy,"and we appreciated the  detailed instructions for the house and lists of things to do in the immediate area and surrounds she left for us in the house. \"",,,,

The neighborhood was charming, green, and walkable, getting to and using the public transportation to get downtown was easy as pie, the yard and back deck were a perfect hangout for a group traveling with dogs, and the bedrooms were quite comfortable, each with its own AC unit for the hot week we had! And a special observation for those who care: none of the beds have footboards, which is a great thing for tall folks who are used to not fitting in beds! Thanks, Margaret, for a lovely stay in your home, your restaurant recommendations, and the monkey bread!"

743211,6126001,2013-07-31,217617,Julie,"Our stay at Margaret's home was fantastic! Beautiful outdoor space and nice open kitchen and dining area. The beds were all very comfortable and the house stayed nice and cool with the use of big open windows and/or room air conditioners. Margaret was kind enough to meet us at the house and allow us to check in very early in the morning. The kitchen is fairly well stocked - we successfully made several dinners there. Jamaica Plains is a good option if you want to stay just outside the hustle and bustle of the city. We found it to be a charming and beautiful neighborhood abounding with parks for our little ones. Only drawback was that the central part of the neighborhood where you will find stores, restaurants and bars is a little bit of a walk. Would have liked it to be a little bit closer (we had to cab home from the supermarket). T stop is about a 15 minute walk making the rest of Boston easily accessible. Overall a great experience. Thank you Margaret!"

The house is very homely and the garden is great; particularly if you want a safe space for youngsters to run around in. I loved standing in the garden grilling our meal and watching a red cardinal feed.
743211,6738979,2013-08-23,2787154,Carman,Margaret's place is fantastic and delivers as advertised. A short walk from the T means you're never far from all that Boston has to offer. Highly recommended.

Margaret was very accommodating and we felt very welcomed in her home.  She left a list of things to do in the area and in downtown Boston including directions.  She was even thoughtful enough to leave a little care package for us during our stay as she knew we were on a girls getaway.  I would highly recommend her home, especially with a group of people.

If you don't know the Boston area, this is a super convenient location close to the Orange Line of the T, near lots of park and playgrounds, a great running/biking path, and lots of store and restaurants.

The kitchen was big enough for a whole bunch of busy cooks preparing for the rehearsal dinner.  And had all the tools and utensils for all of them to use.,,,,,
The dining room was just right for a bridal brunch for 11.  The breakfast bar looked beautiful with all the food and fancy dishes.,,,,,
All 8 of us who stayed there were comfortable.  6 of us in the 3 bedrooms,Grandma in the office on a small bed - and an aunt in the living room on a blow-up mattress.  The groom even slept in the hall the night before the wedding.,,,,

We had a group of 6 and the house easily accommodated us all. Great back yard for a barbeque. Amazing neighborhood with everything you want in easy walking distance. I would definitely stay here again."
743211,20704980,2014-10-04,19754956,Paula,"Margaret's home is lovely, comfortable, and convenient—it was a great launch pad for our adventures. The top floor suite is a luxurious and spacious retreat!"
Margaret was laid back and easy to communicate with. All in all,"we had a fantastic vacation. \"",,,,
743211,21844257,2014-10-25,4302534,Diederik,We very much enjoyed our stay in Margaret's house. The house is light and very spacious. We'll certainly return!
743211,24353155,2014-12-27,17885642,Pat,"Our family of 6 adults and one 18 month old spent 4 days over Christmas in Margaret's spacious and beautifully decorated home.  We were welcomed with a Christmas tree and outdoor lights to help us feel like we were in our own home.  Everything you need is in walking distance and the neighborhood is delightful with Victorian homes of all colors.  The kitchen is very spacious and we all love to cook, so was perfect for us.  The house is full of light as there are many windows.  The master bedroom on the third floor has 5-6 large windows alone, you feel like you are in a tree house!  And, that is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!  By the way, the neighborhood is VERY quiet."
Margaret was easy to work with and so accommodating.  We were able to bring my son's dog with us,and,of course,she allows little ones.  She was out of state when we arrived,so we were thrilled when she,
stopped by on our last day to say hello and to bring us a very tasty treat.  Next time I hope she will come by and drink some Jack's Abby beer with us!,,,,,
Book this home,"it is worth every penny and you will not be sorry.\"",,,,
743211,25640454,2015-01-21,25719923,Amy,The home was lovely and comfortable.  Margaret and her friend Angie were very attentive and helpful.  The Jamaica Plains area is also great! I will definitely plan to stay here again for future trips to Boston.
743211,30437247,2015-04-22,19780303,Calvin,"We very much enjoyed staying in Margaret's home. The house was just as represented in the listing, but with even more character. There was plenty of room for all us along with plenty of hot water and water pressure. The location of the house was perfect for accessing the T to get to all the Marathon activities. We enjoyed the house and the neighborhood."
743211,31573318,2015-05-07,7995323,Sharon,"Margaret's house was exactly what we were looking for while visiting Boston.  We were given the keys and good wishes to have fun and we did!  Margaret's home is  warm and comfortable.  Jamaica Plain was wonderful and convenient to transportation to downtown Boston.  We were confused by a  text message from Margaret on our second night in the house, asking us to mind the noise and to respect the neighbors which I feel compelled to comment about.  We are a family, not loud, nor party animals and it seemed to us a surprise comment, because we were behaving respectively and simply enjoying the patio that is part of the house."
We loved staying here and recommend it to future guests.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
743211,31761335,2015-05-10,1792703,Beth & Tom,"Margaret is a warm and friendly host, communicating quickly to any questions.  We stayed for a long weekend at her home in Jamaica Plain near Boston for a family gathering."
Her home is cozy and lived in.  She must be a good cook - her kitchen is fully equipped!  Things we loved - our family being under the same roof,the grill,sun drenched deck,lovely garden,and walking distance to the village center and T.,
The bathrooms and kitchen are dated but functional.  The house is older,yet comfortable.  The listing indicates 4 bedrooms,though there are three real beds and Margaret was kind enough to set up a twin cot in the office.  Ample off street parking!,,,
"Thank you Margaret for your hospitality.\"",,,,,
743211,32448778,2015-05-18,25863868,Tom,Margaret was a warm and welcoming host who made every effort to ensure our comfort. The house was very clean and ready to receive guests. The neighborhood was nice although we didn't really have much time to explore. We would definitely go back should the occasion arise.
743211,34334081,2015-06-07,8627977,Joy,"This home was perfect! I had my entire family visiting for graduation and everyone fit comfortably. Our host was responsive, accommodating and even left home brewed beer for us to try! Super sweet and affordable accommodations close to the city as well as close to tons of great JP restaurants and a grocery store. Everyone wanted to stay there next time they visit, great spot!"
743211,34881674,2015-06-13,27103427,Angela,"My co-workers and I rented Margaret's beautiful home during a convention week. We had a great time and her house was convenient to EVERYTHING! About 1/2 mile to the Orange Line, stores and restaurants. It's also a block from parks and is a very walkable location. In traffic it took about 30 minutes to Back Bay. If you're looking for charming and nicely updated home this is the place to stay. I definitely plan to rent this home again when I come back to Beantown."
743211,35487464,2015-06-19,34307177,Leah,"We spent 6 nights at Margaret's house and had a lovely time.  The neighborhood was great for kids with easy walking access to several parks and JP.  The house was lovely and exactly as pictured.  My young boys loved the hammock in the backyard.  I really appreciated all of the extra sleeping spaces.  My boys took turns on the Ikea chair and my inlaws loved being able to escape to the upstairs loft to relax.  Thank you Margaret for your hospitality and also to Angie for checking on us and mailing my son's stuffed animal that was lost in a blanket.  We had a rental car for the week, so parking was great and I found it was easy to drive to other areas of town for wedding events.  We hope to be back soon!"
743211,35906113,2015-06-23,23432747,R,"\"Host's representative met us on arrival and provided a very informative and nice welcome. While drive to property , we viewed some \"\"questionable\"\" neighborhoods"
Older home,but in good condition. Third floor master suite updated and well done.  Off street parking was helpful. Enjoyed deck area and green space surrounding home. Kitchen well equipped. Although we did not use,the T is within aa 10 minute walk. Nice selection of resturants nearby.,,,
While our trip was planned for exploring Boston,"the home also provided an opportunity to enjoy the Jamaica Plains neighborhood.\"",,,,
743211,37835225,2015-07-11,28918918,Neal (And Lisa),"Our stay in Margaret's home was wonderful. It accommodated our family group of eight members and, at times,we had other local family members over to bbq.  We were always comfortable and someone would regularly comment on how much they liked the place.  The house has a lot of character and charm; just the right combination of funky old country house and remodeled comfort.  It has the creature comforts of home which made it easy for us to settle into a cohesive rhythm.  We hardly went out to eat but took advantage of the great kitchen...very nicely equipped,even for our large group.  One day was cool enough to enjoy the yard and garden space which is a delightful feature of this home.  There are many subtle things about this home... not obvious but there when we needed them.  This was our first AirBnB experience and it was very positive.  We did not get to meet Margaret but communication with her by phone and text was easy.  The location was also good.  It was an easy walk to the orange line of the T.   N&L"
743211,39020254,2015-07-20,2704560,Dan & Kathy,"We spent a family weekend at the home- very clean, good walking access to public transportation, and an easy walk to a fantastic arboretum. Margaret was extremely helpful and left lots of great information."
743211,41569721,2015-08-08,22578852,Géraldine,"Les photos et la description de la maison de Margaret présents sur le site internet d’air bnb sont parfaitement conformes avec la réalité. La maison est très agréable et nous nous sommes sentis rapidement comme à la maison : quartier calme, sûr, rue commerçante et vivante à proximité, accès apprécié au jardin et à une grande terrasse. Cette partie de Boston est aérée et verte. L’accès au métro est facile (5 à 10 mn à pied) et la ligne de métro permet d’arriver dans le centre de Boston en 20 mn ensuite. Margaret est une hôte très sympathique et elle a répondu très rapidement avant notre arrivée à toutes nos questions. Elle a tout fait pour que nous nous sentions bien chez elle. Si nous devions revenir à Boston, nous choisirions à nouveau cette maison sans aucun doute !"
743211,45965459,2015-09-07,4440530,Sue,"Margaret was such an attentive, responsive host- fielding all of my questions promptly and graciously accommodating when I had a change in guest count.  The home has such an inviting and warm atmosphere.  It was the perfect place for friends to gather- chatting around the kitchen table or out on the patio overlooking her beautiful garden.  The kids loved the hammock in the backyard.  I personally loved the well stocked kitchen and we often cooked at the house instead of eating out (although there are plenty of dining options near the house on the happening Centre St).  Great proximity to the T and to downtown.  Thanks for sharing your home Margaret!"
743211,51757207,2015-10-24,38033996,Andrew,"Five stars for Margaret!  Everything was perfect, which started with her cheery welcome at the house with a bottle of wine and my favorite micro-brew."
There were four of us business professionals there for a week.  We really appreciated the private parking and quiet location.  The kitchen was well equipped,very clean and the beds were comfortable.,,,,
It was great to be able to take the short walk to Centre Street,"where there were many quality restaurants.\"",,,,
743211,67602229,2016-03-30,31023322,Gherardo,"It was my first experience with airbnb and a great one with Margaret's home.  The house is comfortable, nicely furnished, clean, with a well equipped kitchen  and with a nice garden. The owner gave us the right tips to visit the"
city and Provincetown  (2h 30 mins by car but I highly recommend ). In synthetis the only negative aspect for us  about these 4 days was the cold weather,"which I cannot blame on anybody!\"",,,,
743211,70632761,2016-04-19,44114242,Cary,"Our experience at Margaret's home was excellent. Everything was as described and she was so accommodating with us. She greeted us upon arrival, before she went out of town, and was there to send us off with well wishes. Our group of 7 was there for the marathon and this is the way to go to save money if you have a small group. There is a beautiful lake/pond to run around just .7 mile away. The word is Bill Rogers, legendary marathoner, used to train around this pond. The T stop is less than .5 mile walk and uber prices were VERY affordable to/from the airport. I could not recommend this place any more."
743211,74405654,2016-05-15,61522534,Vicki,Everything was great! A beautiful home perfect for my needs.
743211,82505828,2016-06-27,37444288,Anthony,"Everything about this home was amazing. Host, location, amenities all exceeded expectation. You couldn't have dreamed a better place to stay in Jamaica Plain."
743211,83635098,2016-07-03,48078023,Gail,"Margaret was a great, welcoming host.  She met us at the time we agreed and left us with her home and a nice bottle of wine. We had a big group for a family wedding celebration. The house was comfortable, spacious, a well equipped kitchen and terrific outdoor space for lobster boil, happy hour, and morning coffee. Jamaica Plain is a wonderful neighborhood. Thank you Margaret for your warm hospitality !  We all recommend Margaret and her home as a fabulous place to stay."
743211,92495859,2016-08-08,20121654,Ashley,"Great home in Boston! About a 10 minute drive to downtown or Fenway Park (closer to 30 in traffic). The neighborhood is charming and Margaret's house is a short 5 minute walk to great restaurants, bars, and markets."
8563141,51216474,2015-10-18,14890660,Christopher,"Emma was amazing, knowledgeable, and helped with any questions i had. My first Airbnb experience was EPIC. Perfect location to walk everywhere and eat through the city. Right outside of Chinatown and the Boston commons. I will stay with again! Thanks Emma"
8563141,51796228,2015-10-24,20668475,Catherine,"Great location, close walking distance to T stations for all lines and to the Common and public garden and places to eat. Apartment was clean and tidy and reasonably quiet. Furnishings were basic but quite comfortable. Emma was easy to get in touch with and very responsive, and flexible with arrival and departure times. All in all, we were pretty happy we chose this instead of a hotel."
8563141,52130883,2015-10-26,1234543,Stephanie,"Felt very welcome. Apartment was as clean as a hotel with fresh sheets and towels. She was also very accommodating and let me check out late. Great location, right across from the park and delicious food in Chinatown. Best Banh Mi shop right around the corner."
8563141,52738048,2015-11-01,46084349,Ashley,Great Place right in the center of Theatre District!! Very clean and comfortable. Emma was great to work with. Checking in and out was a breeze.

8563141,59410778,2016-01-10,10980487,Kevin,"Emma is a nice host. She is always fast to reply my questions. Easy to check in. The apartment is clean with all the necessary facilities. Sometimes during the night, there was some noises music coming from the outside."
8563141,62337990,2016-02-14,6043927,Alison,This is a comfortable apartment in a great location. We were there during sub-zero temperatures and we were cosy inside.
Although we were not met on arrival the check in process was straightforward as Emma provided clear instructions in advance.,,,,,
The apartment would be improved by having more kitchen facilities. There was no toaster,"oven/microwave dishes or wine glasses. There were no basic kitchen or laundry provisions provided either.\"",,,,
8563141,63643149,2016-02-25,55075542,Sharon Adelle,The apartment was clean and cozy and the listing was accurate. I requested an extra couple of hours to store my luggage in the apartment and Emma quickly responded to confirm the it was ok. The check-in and check-out process was easy and reasonable.
8563141,66258110,2016-03-20,61995116,James,Almost impossible to beat the location. Literally right across the street from the Boston Common and a block away from the Beantown Pub (which was a great place to begin each night out). The fact that you can see this building from the Freedom Trail means that even the most directionally impaired person can find their way home by simply following the Freedom Trail (this was invaluable).
"The building felt safe and the apartment was clean and comfortable. You pick this place for the location - the fact that the apartment was pretty nice too is just a plus. We were very pleased.  \"",,,,,
8563141,67216391,2016-03-27,40499658,John,"The description was completely accurate. The apartment was in the perfect location right in the downtown crossing area, directly across from the huge park. We were able to easily walk or grab public transportation where we needed to go. The apartment was clean and had plenty of space for 4 people. Check-in/check-out was seamless."
8563141,68099291,2016-04-02,24536796,Damien,"What an awesome place! one the best Air BnB places I've stayed in. Location, Cleanliness, Space, Facilities were all amazing. Location in particular is brilliant. Emma was very responsive and easy to communicate with. Highly recommend this place."

The location of the apartment was perfect. Right across the street from Boston Commons. Even better it was exactly across from the bus loading station to get to the start line of the Boston Marathon, which is why I was in town!"

The listing was very accurate and convenient as we were able to access all of the sights of Boston without any issues. The North End is within walking distance, where you can find great places to eat. The T train is right outside of the building. The check in and check out process was very easy and Emma was very accommodating. I highly recommend this listing to those who are in town for the weekend looking to explore the city."
8563141,73138816,2016-05-07,31885128,Kristina,"Although we didn't meet our host she was very available and accommodating during our stay and arranged for us to leave our luggage until check out. The apt. is just as described, very clean and was close to everything."
8563141,73904684,2016-05-11,4868070,Spencer,"One of this apartment's two bedrooms has no window. Which makes it NOT a legal bedroom, as far as I know."
Other than that: the apartment building is right next to a homeless shelter of some sort,and a few people on the sidewalk in front of the building were rather aggressive. But across the street is Boston Common,"which was really nice to have access to. \"",,,
8563141,74634470,2016-05-16,60972885,Sally,Great spot! Location was perfect and Emma was super responsive and got us all the info we needed.

Five minute walk to South Station. Two bedroom apartment is in a secure five-story building.

I felt like I was at home away from home. Thanks Emma for maintaining a great property- would definitely stay again (and I might for future trips!)."
8563141,82732974,2016-06-29,14051360,Ira,"Emma was very responsive.  Unit itself is very clean and nice.  Location of building is great.  For whatever reason there are a lot of homeless people that gather in front of the building.  Also, when you get off the elevator for the unit you are met by a large trash can used by the tenants for recyclable trash.  I was a little worried but once i got inside the unit i was fine."
8563141,83456107,2016-07-03,72074868,Andre,Excellent location right on Boston Common and very close to station.

Emma's instructions for getting the key were clear and easy to follow.  The only hiccup was the loss of hot water and pressure on the morning we were checking out, but Emma responded immediately when we let her know.  I would definitely stay here again."
8563141,86573849,2016-07-17,52314268,Mark,"No-frills lodging in a bustling, vibrant area of Boston. The place is very clean, surprisingly quiet given its location, and remarkably centered. The office I was visiting was just two blocks away and there are plenty of good food and coffee options nearby. I will stay again as Boston hotels can be alarmingly expensive and this was a nice high value option."
8563141,87549585,2016-07-20,13341139,Scott And Kristy,"The location was just perfect for our 4 day Boston vacation. Boston Common was across the street, convenience stores close by and the subway entrance was only a few steps away. Only 15 mins to Fenway, about the same to the North End, Bunker Hill and Harvard. The apartment fit our needs, downsides: there is no views from the windows and we often had to wait for the elevators. Upsides: LOCATION! Full cable TV, air conditioner/fans, laundry room next door, fully stocked kitchen."
"We were a minute away from the subway that could take us anywhere in the city \"",,,,,
8563141,88153965,2016-07-23,18162472,Asmara,"The apartment is in a great location, particularly if interested in exploring the North End and downtown Boston.  It's steps away from a T stop.  The apartment also was clean and spacious.  On two days, the temperature inside the apartment reached at least 78 (F) degrees."

My group of 14 people stayed here for a few nights and we are extremely happy we chose this apartment. Everything was SUPER CLEAN and new!!! We were able to park in front of the building without a problem which is a big plus, it's FREE PARKING in all the neighborhood. We used the full equipped kitchen and made a lot of meals, also the communication with the hosts was superb and smooth. There's a beautiful park in front of the apartment where I took my little niece for a walk, she loved it. Also the balcony is very pretty too, we had some wine and enjoyed the sunset. Overall, our experience was fantastic! We totally recommend this place to everybody! Thank you guys for making our have a perfect stay!!!"

11498416,65406830,2016-03-13,56610341,Joanna,"Ricardo was extremely helpful and a great host. Very nice and accommodating. My boyfriend and I stayed there the entire week and have no complaints. We didn't need to ask many questions from Ricardo, but he definitely is available and will help you out whether it's suggestions of what to do in Boston, or helping you find something. The room itself was very nice, exactly as advertised, and is warm/cozy. The kitchen is the other great part, so wonderful to have a fully equipped one while traveling."
11498416,65853601,2016-03-17,23217754,Miu,"Ricardo was very responsive in all of the questions that we asked him and was actively taking care of the common areas. The room was just as pictured; however, we did not anticipate the walls to be thin and the bathroom to be shared amongst at least 7 people, including ourselves. Additionally, the floor in the bedroom was creaky and uneven, and it tilted the bed, which made sleeping uncomfortable at times."
11498416,66094944,2016-03-19,50916531,Joy,"Ricardo is a very accommodating host. He is quick to communicate and was available upon our arrival.

11498416,68520105,2016-04-05,3622530,Michal,The worst airbnb apartment we have ever stayed at. There are some facts that are not mantioned by the owner that one must know before renting the place:
1. There are not any real walls between the rooms,but only glass door that is covered with curtains both sides. Meaning you can hear everything from both rooms beside you. When people cough or sneeze it sounds like it just happen in your room.,,,,
2. The floor is very uneveb,making walking in the room very uncomfortable. Due to this the bed is uneven and very uncomfortable.,,,,
3. This isn't a studio apartment.  Its a small room,In a complex of few rooms all together.,,,,
4.The room it self is not clean.,,,,,
5. The floors in the shared spaces (kitchen and shower) were always dirty.,,,,,
There are few pro's to the place:,,,,,
1. The kitchen it self is nice and well equipped other than that.,,,,,
2. The shower is fine but if some guests wanted to shower at the same time the hot water will run off.,,,,,
3. The location is goog and easy to get to center of boston.,,,,,
And eventually- about ricardo: he was very un welcoming.,,,,,
We stayed for 6 nights (honestly we tried to move in the middle but couldn't find a place ). The construction work at the second floor made a lot of noise (was never mentioned before we arrived also...),,,,,
To summarize,beside a good location we felt cheated and would recommend to watch out from this place,unless the owner will do some dramatic changes. We use airbnb a lot when we travel,including last year in boston,"and this was absolutely the worst expirience we had. \"",
11498416,70059714,2016-04-15,1408625,Philip,This is a pretty good value place but know what you're getting with your savings.
Pros - The price is low for near downtown Boston. The location is very convenient to the metro,which is only 2 stops from downtown Boston.  Ricardo was very nice and responsive to emails and texts. The kitchen is decently stocked.  The best Mexican food in Boston is nearby and open late. There's 24 hour convenience/drugstores a short walk away.,,,,
Cons - The hostel is in the middle of 2 construction sites. During the week,work would start around 7am. The windows are decent but it's literally next door so unless you're a heavy sleeper or a morning person,you're going to suffer.  That's in addition to the thin walls and somewhat creaky floors (an issue in most places in Boston). The hostel and rooms are very basic (older,"mismatched furniture) but generally clean. If you have higher cleanliness standards you may be disappointed.\"",,
11498416,70541208,2016-04-18,63010524,Jeff,"Ricardo is an excellent host. The place was exactly as described, and Ricardo was very easily reachable if needed."
The location of the hostel is great,a minute's walk from the blue line metro line (Maverick) which is just a stop away from Aquarium (very cool downtown spot with Quincy Market,harbour,nice sightlines) and reachable from anywhere in the city by transit. Also there are parks nearby with picturesque views of the Boston skyline over the harbour.,,
It's a hostel w/ private bedrooms,just make sure that's the type of thing that suits you going in. It suited me just fine.,,,,
"Thanks for making my first experience with airbnb a good one.\"",,,,,
11498416,70794114,2016-04-20,24386293,Joshua,Great host.
11498416,71160561,2016-04-24,37431337,Bernhard,Ricardo was the best host! Very helpful and always available. The whole house was very clean and the room was big. There are 2 construction sites on each side of the house - but we didn't have a problem with that. :)
11498416,71901699,2016-04-29,68727081,Federico,Everything was perfect!
I truly recommend to stay on ricardo place,,,,,
"Very peaceful place\"",,,,,
11498416,73717296,2016-05-09,38848955,Heidi,"Had a great time in Boston and the apartment/hostel was just as described. Beautiful natural lighting, comfortable and clean bed, a shared kitchen but I never felt I was sharing it with anyone (never saw anyone else cooking). The bathroom is clean and as described, shared...but only amongst two other units, so i never had to wait in line or anything like that. Ricardo was readily available to respond to text messages at all times, and when interacting with him in person he was friendly and pleasant. If you're trying not to spend your life saving on a hotel in Boston, I would highly recommend staying at Ricardo's place. Probably $150 cheaper per night then most places and such a great location too.  Two thumbs up!"
11498416,73927130,2016-05-11,64949255,Silviya,Perfect location if it's your first time in Boston.
11498416,74171364,2016-05-13,24317207,Tin-Lont,Ricardo is an amazing host. The room we rented was clean and welcoming. As well as the rest of the house. Really calm neighbourhood near the water. It was also really close to a subway station that was 1 station away from dtown boston. Definitely recommend Ricardo and his house !
11498416,74624198,2016-05-16,13597465,Julia,Ricardo foi ótimo. Fez com que conseguíssemos nos hospedar em sua casa. Tem metro próximo a sua casa. Estava de carro e não tive nenhum em encontrar estacionamento na rua. Mesmo o banheiro sendo compartilhado estava sempre muito limpo.
11498416,75147635,2016-05-19,6708118,Ketan,"Ricardo was very helpful, for anything he got back Almost immediately. The place was clean."

11498416,77865281,2016-06-04,72757415,Dave,"A really great first air bnb experience for me, Ricardo could not have been more helpful. A gem of a location & a knowledgeable host, great shout about the food in Little Italy. Thank you Ricardo for everything, you made Boston an easy & enjoyable place to visit."
11498416,78153805,2016-06-05,30876444,Greg,"Ricardo was available through email and What'sApp and responded to me right (URL HIDDEN) in the email about check in, check out, and access to the house was easy to follow."
Great location (5 min walk to Maverick station which is one stop away from downtown and one away from airport station!),right next to the waterfront.,,,,
The room is not glamourous,the walls are too thin (bring earplugs!) and the bed sheets are polyester which is super sweaty (we just used the comforter and put the fan on). But it was a good enough room to sleep and keep our stuff in.,,,,
The upstairs bathtub is clogged and the towel rack fell right of the wall,but the other bathroom and both kitchens were great.,,,,
Overall,a good spot,but I would only stay again if it was cheaper. It was about $150 a night because of demand I suppose,"but that seemed like a lot.\"",,
11498416,78660193,2016-06-08,50786098,Jingwei,Thank you for the room. It's a nice place to stay!
11498416,79031126,2016-06-10,17377847,Antonio,It's cheap and it's just one metro station from the airport and city center (4m walking to the station).
If you are a backpacker,it's should be ok.. If you want a cozy place to take a rest this is not for you.,,,,
The rooms have doors between them,you can listen everything,even the sound when someone plug in the mobile to charge. Rooms are too old and the matress is really soft..,,,
"Wifi is good.\"",,,,,
11498416,81032351,2016-06-20,2744740,Clare,"Ricardo's place was adequate for what we needed in Boston, however it is reasonably basic.  The room is quite tight for two, without much space for luggage, while the separation between the rooms is just a glass door (with gap underneath) with curtains across it - limited privacy and can everything being said in the adjoining room.  Also the mattress is just foam, so not the most comfortable and supportive.  That said, the room is well filled with light and the kitchen functions well.  The neighborhood is fun too, and public transport is very convenient from the apartment. We did not meet Ricardo and there was no one to greet us, however it was straight forward to access our room. If you are looking for something cheap (for Boston) with convenient access to public transport and don't mind limited privacy and somewhat uncomfortable accommodations then this fits the bill, otherwise I'd suggest spending a little more for some privacy and comfort."
11498416,82864591,2016-06-30,70742086,Lawrence,"Listing was as expected more or less. Construction outside was incredibly annoying in the mornings; loud slamming of doors late at night was also very frustrating and the uneven floors were off putting. In addition, the bed was super soft; some people might like that but my back was killing me the entire trip."
On the plus side,"the wifi was quick enough and Ricardo was incredibly fast with his responses to any concerns. \"",,,,
11498416,86535285,2016-07-16,22166229,Katrina,"\"My husband and I had a great stay at Ricardo's place. It is very conveniently located near a \"\"T\"\" stop on the blue line"
11498416,87319575,2016-07-19,8261576,Sandra & Omar,"Nice bedroom, clean and with lots of light."
A little hot at night (no AC) but for the price and location it is a very good option.,,,,,
Also just 2 block away from the train station and very essay to get an Uber or Lyft to go to the airport at midnight.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
11498416,87921763,2016-07-22,15510671,Keith,My wife and I stayed here during a two day trip to Boston and it was a great place to stay.
Parking was on-site and easy,"good wi-fi and close to the T. It's a great place to stay if you need a place to crash while exploring the Boston area.\"",,,,
11498416,89596969,2016-07-29,21796744,Chanan,OK.
11498416,89651700,2016-07-29,86242764,Hannah,"The apartment was in a great location near the airport and was really easy to get into. Made checking in and getting there really easy, especially when we were exhausted from jet lag. I would, however, pay special care to one of the amenities lacking in the list: air conditioning. We had an extremely hard time sleeping because of the heat, and because there was noisy construction going on starting at 6 AM in the morning right next door."
11498416,90546946,2016-08-01,85028977,Michael,"Nice place, close to an amazing night view."
Close to the train,"in a few minutes from down town.\"",,,,
11498416,91301387,2016-08-04,36024829,David,"Al fine and correct. The place is a family run hostel and that's what you get. It is clean, but spartan."
The only downside is all the construction work being made all around the neighborhood that will wake you up early (wether you like it or not). Once that's over,the place will be top.,,,,
"Don't miss the views from the oceanside at night. Spectacular!\"",,,,,
11498416,93414301,2016-08-12,18590067,William John,We never met Ricardo but he provided comprehensive instructions for how to access the property prior to arriving.
"The room itself was fairly basic but more than suitable for our needs and fantastic value for money. Would definitely recommend if visiting Boston on the cheap.\"",,,,,
11498416,94955870,2016-08-17,69534303,Lea,"L'appartement est plutot bien situé, a 10min de l'aéroport et deux pas de la ligne bleue qui mène au centre ville. Juste au bout de la rue, qui donne sur l'ocean, il y a un parc avec l'une des plus belles vues de boston au coucher du soleil."
Par contre la clim manque terriblement quand il fait 40degres dans la chambre,les murs ne sont pas très épais,les fenêtres et les rideaux non plus. Nous avons été réveillés à 7h tous les jours par les autres habitants,la lumière,la chaleur,les travaux
La chambre était assez spacieuse pour 2 personnes,l'accueil chaleureux,les deux cuisines bien équipées. Et rien à dire sur la propreté des lieux,"c'était niquel et nettoyé tous les jours.\"",,

11498416,97716309,2016-08-28,75701139,David,Apartment close to the Logan airport. Maverick Subway station 2 minutes walking. Very easy access. Room and kitchen very clean. Restroom depends on the people staying at the same time.
"Good experience in general\"",,,,,
11498416,98908734,2016-09-02,58211707,Callum,"The listing is pretty accurate. The building is fairly basic but amenities are all fine - we used the kitchen each morning and for a few dinners and it was always clean and functional, though it could be better stocked with equipment (chopping boards!). The room was a little hot during the day, but nothing too bad. Only real complaint was the construction noise from next door, hopefully that finishes up soon."
The location is pretty good; there's not a ton of stuff in the neighbourhood itself,but the room is only 2 minutes from a subway station,really convenient to downtown and other services (laundry,groceries),and we always felt very safe,"even coming back from a Red Sox game after midnight. \""
5267396,26807081,2015-02-19,1200712,Jack,I stayed in the apartment for two nights while traveling in Boston. The space was nice and clean. It was well stocked with kitchen equipment and toiletries. The only downside was the heat could be spotty at times. Steven was very welcoming and always accessible.
5267396,27229023,2015-02-28,22561695,Ringo,Nice apartment with private kitchen and bathroom. Very convenient for my trip. Steven was a great host.
5267396,27414139,2015-03-03,28254764,Céline,"Steven was nice enough to great us with a bottle of wine. We had all the necessities made available to us. The convenience store next door was quite handy. The only downside was how cold it got in the apartment during the day while we were gone. Otherwise, it was a great first experience with airbnb."
5267396,29187983,2015-04-05,22615539,Sarah,Appartement tres agreable.
On a vu Steven a peine 5'. On a pas eu le temps de lui poser les questions du type : est ce qu'il y a un supermarché?,,,,,
En revanche,"lit tres agreable avec matelas chauffants ! \"",,,,
5267396,30606544,2015-04-25,11584742,Krissy And Josh,"Steven's place is in a great location, just around the corner from the Orange Line.  He was flexible with our arrival and departure times, very easy to work out all the details.  His space is in an older building, best suited for 1-2 people.  I'd say it may not be for everyone and is probably more comfortable for younger travelers."
5267396,31321822,2015-05-04,7323907,Melissa,The apartment was perfect.  It was clean and cozy and just what we needed for our weekend stay in Boston.  It was close to the train and a short cab ride to Fenway.  Steven was great and was kind enough to let me arrive earlier since my bus arrived before check in.    Overall I had a great experience and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy apartment to stay in while in Boston.
5267396,31829593,2015-05-10,6909243,Andrew,Steven was a friendly host - who helped us with our bags when we arrived. It was easy to contact him and he was responsive to our requests. He was also accommodating of an early arrival and early change to plans as we found a longer-term place to live.
The place is accurately described and is very close to public transport (the T - Orange Line) and other locations.,,,,,
"It is a bit of an older place in a rougher part of town - but apart from this it was otherwise clean.\"",,,,,
5267396,34079359,2015-06-04,33163943,Kristi,Steven was cordial and professional and posted his cell number on the frig for any questions. He allowed me to store my suitcase there after the checkout time because my plane left in the evening. Much appreciated.
There were additional niceties that were also appreciated:,,,,,
Brita water filter,,,,,
Some simple food items which were helpful (cereal,orange juice,milk,etc.),,
A spa robe,,,,,
An umbrella (which I had forgotten to pack),,,,,
The unit has everything you need for a good trip - quick access to the Orange Line,the Green Line wasn't far,fully supplied kitchen,a Dunkin' Donuts on the corner,pizza on another corner and a small market two doors down. The WiFi was very dependable.,
I would suggest the unit needs a little more attention to detail. It could use a paint job,with dents/screws/paint splatters in the walls repaired. It would benefit from some (up to date/repaired) art/décor.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5267396,35081437,2015-06-15,13506057,Brandon,"Steven was a great host; he made it super simple to get to the apartment, was in constant contact via text message if I needed anything, and the apartment was accurately described. The apartment is situated in between the Orange and Green T Lines, which made getting into the city a snap. There are a few small grocery stores located nearby, as well as a larger grocery store 8 minutes away by foot. I didn't spend much time in the neighborhood, but it seemed like there were a lot of cool new restaurants and bars to check out."
Some things about the apartment: it is small,but very usable. There is no washer and dryer,which is typical for Boston,so don't plan on being able to do laundry. Everything was very clean,but this is an old building,so it's not much to look at from the outside. The neighbors upstairs were often loud and there were a lot of people in and out of the building up until about 2 - 3am. If noise bothers you
All-in-all,"I highly recommend Steven's apartment!\"",,,,
5267396,35578782,2015-06-20,23784406,Karine,"This is an old but nice and clean apartment with a comfortable bed, a well equipped kitchen, and wireless internet. Steven has very well organized the apartment and is very helpful and responds quickly to messages. The apartment is situated near the Longwood medical center and is very close to the Orange and Green T lines. There are several restaurants and a big grocery store within 10 minute walk. Overall I was satisfied with my stay."

Parking on the street was a breeze, and the having the T nearby made sightseeing very easy. Steven made sure that my check-in smooth and seamless."
I found the apartment to be very comfortable. The AC kept me nice and cool when it got hot outside,there were plenty of Bath towels,and the entire place was immaculate!,,,
Mission Hill is a quintessential Boston neighborhood. The streets are lined with brownstone townhouses and brightly colored triple-deckers. The Museum of Fine Arts as well as BPD HQ were down the street,"which made me feel extra safe and cultured!\"",,,,

He greeted us at the door, gave us some quick instructions, and let us on our way. The apartment is just as described. It is a very old building but the apartment was neat and clean. It's very small but perfect for the person who just needs a clean, convenient place to sleep. There is only one air-conditioning unit that is in the bedroom that does not really reach the rest of the apartment to cool. This was not a major problem for us. We kept the bathroom window open to let a little breeze in and it never got too hot. And we just made sure the bedroom door was closed at night to keep the cool air in the room. The apartment is very conveniently located to the subway, Dunkin Doughnuts, and a small convenient store."

It is an old apartment but well renovated. The room and bathroom are small. Just enough space for a couple. It is not a bed and breakfast, but there's a Keurig coffee maker, cereal, juice and nutella in the kitchen, which was what we needed to start our mornings. Great location. Free parking on the streets. We only met Steven once when we arrived and he was nice to wait up for us as we arrived at midnight."
5267396,42606829,2015-08-14,26675677,Sally,"Knowing this neighbourhood was a little different to others, we didn't have any problems and found it to be quite charming if a little rough round the edges. The place is good, fits requirements and works well for a simple place to crash."
However,it's Steven who really made our stay great. From the little touches such as leaving cold drinks and snacks,to replying right away when we had the AC on the wrong setting,he was a brilliant host.,,
I'd recommend this place for a simple,"hassle free place to stay - and getting the orange line in is very easy and quick!\"",,,,

Steven was quick in responding, provided great recommendations on restaurants and generously offered to hold our bags since we had an evening flight. I would recommend this location if you are looking for a place close to public transport, Northeastern or are up for walking to Fenway and the Common."

5267396,63970183,2016-02-28,7785520,Daniela,Staying at Stevens listing made my Boston experience that much better. Coming back from a long day to a relaxing home was perfect! Everything from the great hospitality to the small details around the apartment. I couldn't have asked for more. Thank you!!
5267396,64477701,2016-03-04,13342406,Margaretha,"I was in town to be with my mother who was at Brigham and Women's hospital. Steven was very nice, accommodating and responsive. He also respected my privacy. I felt at home in the space, and felt like I could relax, which I really needed. The space was very well equipped with amenities and utilities. Overall this was a great experience for me. I would recommend this space for folks who need a no frills affordable and private accommodation while in Boston."

The kitchen was stocked with snacks and drink and coffee, which was a nice touch. I even accidentally locked myself out, and Steven was there in 5 mins to let me in. Great host."
5267396,66440299,2016-03-22,12029485,Luis,"Steven was very available and responded promptly to our questions, even going as far as holding our bags past checkout time since we had a late flight. He was very accommodating with our late-night arrival and explained everything thoroughly once we arrived. The apartment was cozy and very close to a T stop, which was fantastic for getting to and from the apartment easily.  The kitchen and bathroom were each fully equipped, and the entire apartment itself was very clean and welcoming. Overall, it was a great place to stay while we were in Boston."
5267396,66786994,2016-03-24,50845326,Ludovic,"This flat was perfect for what we needed, as having a car parking space was essential. It was great to be so close to the transport links, and there is a good pub called the Squealing Pig nearby."
Steven had set everything up for us,including breakfast,"which was very helpful. We had everything we needed. Thanks Steven.\"",,,

5267396,70015969,2016-04-15,2921573,Andrew,"My two week stay in Steven's apartment went smoothly. He greeted me upon arrival and explained the ins and outs of the apartment. Drinks and snacks were provided which was a nice welcoming touch. The apartment was clean and comfortable. The area isn't bad but I would not claim it to be entirely safe. I would recommend staying with Steven if you're visiting Boston Children's, Brigham or any of the Longwood hospitals/schools."
5267396,70764897,2016-04-20,34578628,Peter,"Great value and location! This was my second time staying at Steven's flat, and I didn't realize how close it was to Fenway park. There was an abundance of parking spots and the T is next door, which is always good for Boston. The place was very clean, comfortable, and well-stocked. Since the first time I stayed, a great burger boutique opened nearby called Beta Burger. I would definitely recommend staying at Steven's place! Easy access to downtown, Longwood, and Brookline."

He answered any questions we had and was communicative and accommodating. The apartment is small, yet efficient. It is very clean and has some cute, personal touches that make it feel more homey and welcoming. It is really close to the T, so it made getting around Boston so easy.  Steven was gracious enough to provide drinks and snacks, which were very much appreciated. We loved our stay in Boston and would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves back in the area!"
5267396,72884561,2016-05-05,69982131,J,Smooth. Well written and good description of place. Very comfortable and cozy. Safe. You can tell Steven takes a lot of pride in his place.
5267396,73287656,2016-05-08,8799552,Khrystyna,"Steven's place is small but cosy, super-tidy and well-equipped.

On the edge of a great neighborhood with plenty of stuff to walk to within 15 minutes. Steven was very nice; apartment clean, and lots of goodies awaiting us when we arrived."
5267396,75263882,2016-05-20,239990,Anri,Communication was very clear and easy with Steven. The apartment was as described and tidy. Convenient location and would highly recommend to anyone staying in Boston!

It was very nice and we had an enjoyable stay. Steven made sure we were comfortable and if we needed anything he was there to assist. We highly recommend staying here! The area was great for our needs and close to so many things. Wonderful place to stay!! The place was so clean and wonderful details . The fresh flowers were the icing on the cake. Awesome place to stay!!"
5267396,76413034,2016-05-27,69888007,Hannah,Great place to stay in Boston!  Steven is an awesome host and left plenty of snacks and drinks in the kitchen.  He even kept our bags a few hours after check out.  Very close to Fenway and the orange line.  Getting around was a breeze!
5267396,76554204,2016-05-28,23378394,Fernando,"My first time being in Boston was made so much better by my AirBnB Host.  He was great with communication, and provided a great space to stay in. It really did make me feel as if I was a part of Boston. My travels took me elsewhere so I only stayed with Steven for a night. However, the unique and pleasant experience really set the tone for the great trip."
5267396,77139940,2016-05-30,15221080,Esther,"Steven is the most gracious and awesome host one can have. Always in communication, very patient and available for any questions."
As others have said it is literally just a block away from the Orange T-Line making the location easily accessible and convenient. Neighborhood felt safe too. The apartment itself is clean and cozy,it has a unique well decorated style,the space is wonderfully laid out,and there were some potted plants and flowers throughout to make the space even more comfortable.  It is a perfect space for two people staying in town for a few days. Almost everything is provided for guests. Kitchen is fully stocked with snacks,cereal,K-Cup coffee
Steve is a true class act: it was my birthday weekend and my boyfriend coordinated with him to have flowers delivered and waiting upon our arrival.,,,,,
All in all it was a great and comfortable stay. Definitely 5 star worthy.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5267396,79940933,2016-06-15,73474140,Mark,Steven met me as soon as I got there and gave me a quick tour. The kitchen was stocked with some coffee and tea that really was a treat every morning. The kitchen also had everything I needed to keep myself fed since the food around the block wasn't my kind of fair.
This was the best rate for a private room I could find around Northeastern U since that was the purpose of my trip. I also really appreciate having a working TV since I could watch the NBA finals.,,,,,
"Thanks again Steven.\"",,,,,
5267396,81017638,2016-06-20,10461113,Ariel,"Steven was an excellent host, taking care to make sure we had everything we needed. The listing was exactly as described, and it was conveniently close to the T station. We found the price very fair, given the location and the surrounding neighbourhood."
5267396,81849372,2016-06-25,30737853,Kelly,The place was great - well situated and very very clean (the cleanest Air b'n'b I've ever stayed in!). Steven was also easy to communicate with and responded quickly. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston.
5267396,83978838,2016-07-05,26768733,Austen,Steven’s apartment was a great little spot for us. It was really convenient to walk almost anywhere and easily hop on the T train via the Orange Line for longer stretches of exploring Boston.
He keeps it incredibly clean,well stocked,& comfortable. The towels were thick,the sheets soft,& the water pressure in the shower was excellent. Loved the décor too. The main downside is that there is only 1 AC unit in the window of the bedroom and it runs really loudly – the kitchen and bath stay pretty warm without the airflow. However,that comes with the territory of going to a northern city in the summer.  It’s not a place you rent and lounge around in since there isn’t really a den/living room
"\"",,,,,
5267396,84428125,2016-07-07,2121343,Cassandra,"Steven was an excellent host who made himself available for any questions or issues if we had any. The location was perfect for jumping on the rail to downtown and quiet. Mission Hills was a nice change of pace from fancier neighborhoods like Back Bay. Great stay, thanks!"
5267396,85235042,2016-07-10,33245473,Evan,"Excellent visit and great host. Steven made it super easy for us to make it to the home and we enjoyed the clean, welcoming hospitality.

5267396,86400966,2016-07-16,65208726,Josh,"Steven provides a very cute 1 bedroom apartment just a few minute walk from the orange line. He was very flexible with my arrival and departure times which was a huge plus since I arrived so late. the apartment was very clean and tidy, and even came stocked with snacks, coffee, beverages, a great guide book, and toiletries. the neighborhood was safe and had great shops and restaurants in walking distance. you can really live like a local in this apartment which is exactly what I was looking for. I would definitely stay here again."
5267396,86618768,2016-07-17,41771989,Kat,"Steven was very nice and made it a point to show us around the apartment and leave helpful instructions.

"It was a cozy but very comfortable stay. \"",,,,,
5267396,89573389,2016-07-29,41661062,Mike,A comfortable apartment in a convenient location. Much quieter than I would have expected in an urban neighborhood. Steven made sure that everything would be in readiness for my arrival and departure.
5267396,90586510,2016-08-01,43809879,Roberth,Really nice apt. Close to the train station. Quiet neighborhood. Totally recommended.
5267396,92657174,2016-08-09,28425855,Marisa,This was my first time using AirBnB and Steven was very patient while I figured out the reservation process. He was extremely prompt in his communication (generally responding in less than five minutes). The apartment was exactly as it seemed in the picture and I couldn't have asked for anything more. Steven left little goodies for us to munch on and clearly wanted us to feel at home. I would most definitely stay in Stevens apartment if I came back to Boston.
5267396,92880323,2016-08-10,16793101,Maria,"Steven was a great host. Unfortunately we could not stay in the apartment more than one night and ended up arriving late in the evening. However, due to our short overnight Steven made checking in and out super easy by providing a lock box for us. When we opened the apartment door is was a breath of fresh air to see a very clean and freshly made bed. Steven even left fresh flowers, snacks, drinks, and a hand written welcome note for us before checking in."
5267396,93363150,2016-08-12,15608483,Evan,Clean and very thoughtfully equipped apartment.

Right between Boylston and Newbury...restaurant, shopping, Public a Gardens and many events are all pretty much walking distance.  We will always stay here when we visit Boston."
2881388,14491682,2014-06-20,16573912,Ryan,"Excellent communication and the property was just as described.  Wonderful location, well-appointed and incredibly easy.  All you could ask for from an Airbnb experience."
2881388,14624240,2014-06-23,15423019,Vicky,My family and I had a lovely time staying at Jason's beautiful apartment. The apartment comfortably fits 6 and I would describe it as luxurious! The location is in the heart of Boston's most beautiful neighborhood and easily accessible to public transportation as well as city tours. Jason was immediately responsive to all requests and inquiries. I would definitely recommend staying here.
2881388,15069254,2014-07-01,202381,Jade,"My colleague David and I had a fantastic experience in Boston!  I contacted Jason to book his apartment for a week of business travel and he was quick to respond (within minutes) and very accommodating.  I arrived after having lost my luggage (thanks to the airline) and Jason was there to greet me personally, along with some super delicious cookies from a local bakery and wine.  The apartment is stunning and has all the amenities you would ever think of needing for a week in Boston.  The furniture is comfy, towels and linens are high quality, and the roof deck is absolutely perfect for a sunny bbq.  Jason's family owns the business downstairs, so you never feel like you can't get ahold of someone if there's a need for it.  Also, if you have time and want a real Boston experience - talk to Jason about the option for sailing around the Boston Harbor.  His dad has a sailboat that will blow your mind.  Overall - amazing experience and great hospitality!  I give this two enthusiastic thumbs up.  Thanks for everything, Jason!"
2881388,15825431,2014-07-16,12756243,Maryam,"Jason was a very nice host, we was quick to respond and helpful. His apartment however, was lacking. For the price my family was paying we expected more. Though Jason had kindly stocked the kitchen with a few of the items we had asked, it had  close to no necessities for cooking."
The space itself is much smaller than we realised and the two bottom bedrooms were tiny,the master having an exceptionally uncomfortable bed.,,,,
The bedroom on the upper floor was well,just plain odd. The room is very large and sparse with a large tv,and an awkwardly placed rickety bed. There are no proper curtains,so sunlight wakes you up bright and early,and the grill outside has not been cleaned,so it is not really fit for use.
Another issue is the laundry,which is located in the basement and have to pay $10 dollars every time you wish to do a load,for such an expensive listing,you would expect a unit in the apartment itself.,,
That being said,all the downsides for the apartment are made up for by the amazing location. One could not ask for a better place to be situated,right in the heart of Newbury,close to everything: restaurants,shopping and more. It is really one of the best locations to be in Boston.,
Overall,though there were quite a few issues,the location does make up for a majority of what is lacking in the apartment,"and Jason was a very nice and helpful host!\"",,
2881388,16491643,2014-07-28,17636870,Steven,The apartment was just as advertised. Fantastic back bay location close to restaurants and shopping. Lovely interior. Added bonus of rooftop terrace with BBQ which we thoroughly enjoyed. The host was very receptive to our needs - above and beyond the call of duty.
2881388,16899970,2014-08-04,11346127,Kedar,Beautiful apartment right in the heart of back bay...Jason is a terrific host.  We had a minor issue with the TV on the first evening and he was over in 10 minutes at 8pm to solve it.  We forgot to ask for a late check out on Sunday and he worked with us perfectly to accomodate our family. The apartment itself is terrific and well-appointed and Jason is making improvements every day!  Would definitely stay again next time we are through Boston.

2881388,17229857,2014-08-09,15775769,Alan,Great experience.  Jason was tremendously responsive but left us to have the week to ourselves.  The apartment was great.  There was a review about an uncomfortable bed - no idea what they were thinking.  Everything was great and welcoming and comfortable.  A+  (And I am in the hospitality business so my standards are high.  I would recommend this without reservation.)
2881388,18861955,2014-09-01,5503767,Peggy,Jason was wonderful in getting us situated our family in his wonderful apartment. Our family of 5 were extremely comfortable and the apartment was beautifully furnished and well appointed.

It was easy to check-in and check-out. The house was beautiful and was great for my work colleagues. We squeezed 5 of us in there for a week. Even though it was a little snug we were able to pull it off. The house was in prime condition and everything in the house worked great. The location is amazing as well- easy to get a cab, and right in the heart of the city. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in Boston!

This place has it all! A+ OUTSTANDING!"

He left very clear instructions on how to get inside, and when we arrived there was a bottle of wine and cookies with a nice note left on the counter. He communicated with me to make sure everything was going well, and let me know I could contact him at any time with questions. The place itself was just as described and absolutely beautiful and clean. The location couldn't be better, steps away from shops, restaurants, and grocery stores. I spent numerous days looking at the sales on newbury street and exploring all of back back! Also, a quick walk to the T. It was perfect!"
2881388,25420172,2015-01-15,23110877,Hugh,Fantastic space that could easily host more than the three people we had in our party

2881388,26730234,2015-02-18,22606357,Debbie,We were made to feel extremely welcome even before we had stepped in to the building with contact beforehand.  We had exact information about how to get the keys and the process was flawless.  When we got in to the condo there was all the information we needed plus some cookies and wine!
2881388,26948733,2015-02-22,2797339,Erik,By far the BEST & MOST ACCOMIDATING Airbnb experience ever!
Jason is great - he is very accessible and the images do no justice to the space and cleanliness of the duplex!,,,,,

2881388,27348656,2015-03-02,27497042,Meredith,"We absolutely loved this apartment and it was perfect for our needs. Jason was extremely attentive from the time of booking forward--answering questions about grocery stores and even leaving a bottle of wine and cookies for us upon arrival. He always answered within the hour, and made himself available at all times if needed. In addition, he was gracious enough to let us stay past checkout since our flights were later in the afternoon. We will be back! You cannot find a better location."
2881388,27931489,2015-03-15,6468107,Nick,"This place is great!  Rented it for a short weekend trip with 4 other friends and had a blast.  There's so much to do within walking distance that we didn't even need to call a cab or Uber anywhere until the last day.  Crazy spacious, very well maintained, and Jason couldn't be a better host.  I highly recommend it."
2881388,28312422,2015-03-22,7385416,Karen,"Jason was a fantastic host.  We arrived to some fresh cookies and a bottle of wine--not to mention a *very* clean and comfortable apartment that was the perfect size and location for the six of us as we explored Boston over the weekend.  Jason emailed and left for us a printed copy of instructions, recommendations, and information about the area, which was an extremely helpful reference.  He helped us with some local restaurant recommendations as well, responding immediately via text.  The entire time (even before we arrived) Jason's communication was very thorough and timely.   We received a text on the day of check-in to welcome us and let us know that he was there for any questions or anything we needed at all.  We all commented that we felt as if we were staying at a friend's apartment.   Thank you Jason!  We hope to come again."
2881388,28610610,2015-03-27,28283129,Erin,An excellent option if you are attending a conference at the Hynes Convention Center! This space is a very short walk to the convention center- it saved us from needing to rent a vehicle during our trip. The apartment was beautiful and met all of our needs. Check-in and check-out were very smooth. Jason was a very helpful host and was available by phone even though he was out of town. I would absolutely stay here again!
2881388,28862825,2015-03-31,17531978,Jose,"Jason is a great host. The apartment is in the best location of Boston, walking distance from fine dining, shopping, and entertainment.

2881388,29906274,2015-04-14,9520151,Melissa,"The apartment is great!  Very spacious for our family of 5, immaculate and well cared for.  The location is extremely central - right beside Newbury Street with so many shops, restaurants and cafes - no need to leave the neighbourhood if you are feeling lazy.  The master bedroom did get a little noise during the night sometimes - rubbish is collected from the alley behind - but Jason had pre-warned us that this room was not best for very light sleepers.  We are city dwellers and accept the noise as part of being in the middle of the action!"
The kitchen is well equipped with good quality appliances,bathrooms clean and spacious,bedrooms have plenty of storage space and linens are immaculate and high quality.,,,
Jason was a great host,very responsive throughout the booking process,flexible and friendly.  He came to our aid within 5 minutes on the first night when we encountered some difficulty with the lock on the outside door and helped us with restaurant recommendations and advice for our trip.  We did not encounter any problems with the apartment,but I am confident that he would have resolved them quickly.,,
I recommend this apartment very highly to anyone that enjoys a city centre location in a really buzzing neighbourhood.,,,,,
"Thanks Jason!\"",,,,,
2881388,30437344,2015-04-22,20669054,Janis,Jason is a great host!  Even before we got to Boston he was very good about communicating with us and providing suggestions on things to do in Boston.
Once we arrived he made sure we knew he was always available if we needed him.  Jason even stopped by to say hello and make sure we knew where the washer and dryer were.,,,,,
The home was as advertised.  It really is a beautiful place and was very comfortable.  We didn't want to leave at the end of our stay.,,,,,
It is conveniently located.  You step out the door and it is steps away from fantastic shopping and restaurants on Newbury Street.  It is also an easy walk to The Freedom Trail and Fenway Park.,,,,,
We highly recommend this home.  Can't wait to go back!,,,,,
Thanks so much,Jason!,,,,

The outside terrace is a huge plus and we enjoyed coffee out there each morning. We'll be back!"
2881388,31596866,2015-05-07,1182846,Stan,The apartment was in a great location. We attended a conference at the Hynes convention center. Was almost in the front door. The apartment was very clean and well decorated. Jason was a great host and responded promptly to messages.
2881388,31953375,2015-05-12,21100133,Frank,"We had a great stay in Boston thanks in part to having this apartment as our launching point.  Checking in was easy and we were able to park right out in front for a brief time both to unload and pack up at the end of our stay.  The apartment was clean and charming as represented in the pictures.  The apartment is well-stocked with dishes, glasses, extra towels, pillows, blankets, a hair dryer, shampoo, body wash and hand soaps.  It had everything we needed!"
The location was convenient to the T,and a nice walk in warm weather to the Public Garden (15-20 min).  This place is surrounded by dining options and convenient shopping for anything you forgot (CVS,Walgreens,"etc.).  I would highly recommend it and we plan to return when we travel to Boston again!\"",,
2881388,32444644,2015-05-18,23257169,Nicholas,"Jason could not have been more welcoming and why not, he has a beautiful place to offer, impecably appointed, phenomenal location, and a sweet rooftop deck to top it all off.  Everyone at Meridian Realty (Jason's family's business on the ground floor) was equally welcoming and genuinely helpful.  We were there for a long weekend to celebrate my daughter's graduation from BU, and we could not have been happier with our arrangements."
Jason responded very quickly to emails,texts,calls,and when we needed a couple towels he personally delivered them immediately.  I could go on but then it might not be available the next time we're in beantown.,,
Recommendation: do yourself a favor and checkout Select Oyster Bar just 2 doors down on Gloucester,three words fresh,fresh,fresh.,,
Thanks Jason,"and best of luck with everything!\"",,,,

We arrived to a bottle of wine, a box Bostons best cookies and a nice note welcoming us to the city. We loved every minute we spent in his beautiful condo! The rooftop patio was a wonderful place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. Everything from the kitchen right down to the bedsheets were impeccable. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend this condo to anyone looking for accommodations in the beautiful city of Boston."

Lovely apartment, clean, spacious and stylish, great location and great communication, particularly the welcome email with all the information you would need about contact people, the apartment, surrounding areas, local shops, restaurants and bars, directions, a map etc and more.  The roof terrace with BBQ is an added bonus in the summer months.  Jason is an exceptional host and made it very clear that he is contactable at all times if needed, but we didn't actually need to contact him at all because everything about our stay and the apartment was faultless.  Highly recommended.  You will not be disappointed.  Thanks so much Jason!"

After travelling  to many places in the world and arriving to Boston with my whole family we had a unique and charming flavor of the Bostonian life. The house was impeccable with a Colombian attendant. From the very first moment Jason the owner left us a bottle of wine and Bostonian cookies we enjoyed very much the roof barbecue,"at the sunset. Location at 50 meters form the entrance of the Hynes Convention Center where I had the conference and all the nearby shops for the women of the family was very convenient for the diverse interests of all of us. Even when we left Jason’s father drove us to the airport but this was an exceptional situation of a friendship that we begun. I strongly recommend the rental of this delightful home.\"",,,,

Beautiful and charming Back Bay neighborhood.  Centrally located, walking distance to stores and many excellent restaurants.  Delicious chocolate chip cookies and wine left for us when we arrived.  Outstanding communication with host before and during our stay.  Prompt responses to text messages.  House manual document was very clear and informative with respect to operating instructions for appliances, parking, local attractions, etc.  All six of us felt completely at home.  Top notch experience all around."

2881388,36863684,2015-07-02,8290569,Charles,Truly a great place to stay in Boston. Close to some very cool places and if you are a slave to Apple the store is just around the corner. Jason was a great host as he really took care of us. I would recommend this place in a heart beat. Way better than any hotel. It was very clean and had great amenities.
2881388,42437162,2015-08-13,25007547,Samuel,"Had an incredible experience staying at this listing. It was everything I expected and more. Jason was a phenomenal host who made us feel like him. He made himself available and his team was very helpful as well. The location was perfect when in came to looking for places to eat and drink. Overall, couldn't ask for a better place to stay in Boston and would highly recommend this beautiful listing."
2881388,42813087,2015-08-16,26049313,Andrew,"The apartment was awesome and couldn't be in a better location, right off of Newbury Street.  Everything was clean and well-kept and Jason was very helpful and responsive.  A great stay and would highly recommend 46 Gloucester Street!"
2881388,45127904,2015-08-31,14611183,Liz,"From requesting to book his place to checking out, the process could not have gone more smoothly.  Jason was not only very prompt and responsive, but very accessible and professional.  He was also very friendly and welcoming.  The apartment was true to the description/photos - spacious, well-appointed, and in a GREAT location.  The second floor bedroom was amazing with a rooftop deck.  We were a family of 5 - enough room for my husband, me, our 2 toddlers on the first floor and my mom had the entire second floor to herself which was nice for privacy.  We were close to everything (shopping, comfort food/fine dining, take out/delivery, parks, playground, Charles River, Boston Common, drug store, grocery, etc) and for trips outside of the neighborhood, it was no problem getting a cab right outside the place."
Most importantly,as stated before,Jason was very responsive to our needs and very professional.  I contacted Jason about a few small things that were resolved within minutes of me contacting him (and always with a smile).  I felt like he really wanted to make sure we had the best stay possible and we really appreciated it.  He was flexible about check in and check out (since there was availability) and was sensitive to the fact we had 2 toddlers and trying to make things as easy as possible for us.,,,

2881388,46491189,2015-09-11,14442120,Kenneth,"This is a top-tier property that's properly and professionally managed. Jason is highly organized, very flexible and communicates as needed to ensure a smooth arrival and experience. There are two apartments in this building, we stayed in #3, which occupies the third and fourth floors including a roof deck with BBQ (which we didn't use). The place is immaculate and finishes are new and high end (marble bathrooms, modern lighting, new kitchen, etc.). The place is stocked with the basics - towels, paper goods, shampoo and body wash. There were K-Cup coffee pods and a couple of beers when we arrived. There's a Trader Joe's and Walgreens right around the corner and Hines Convention Center is a frisbee throw away... as are all the great restaurants and shops on Newbury St. Parking is nearby on Dalton, and Uber is ever present. Beds were very comfortable. Two TVs round out the package. We will DEFINITELY be back to this professionally yet personally managed and delightful property with the ideal host.

The apartment was exactly as it looks in the photos. It was very clean and well stocked with linens,paper towels,and other necessities. We cooked breakfast with no problems as the kitchen was fully equipped (except for food,of course).,,
The only negative was the back bedroom is on the alley. The bottle collection from neighborhood restaurants in the middle of the night was quite loud. However,"on the 2nd night we found a white noise machine provided by the host that we had missed earlier. This helped quite a bit.\"",,,,

The area is beautiful, clean, and safe. And Jason was a very caring host. He checked in regularly and made sure we had everything we needed.

His family's retail office was in the lobby and this made all of our communication that much easier as everyone in the office was available to help and answer questions.

When my daughter had her wedding at Boston, I was looking for a place for our family can stay together instead of staying at separate hotel rooms. The place was exactly as it was described on AirBnB. The home was located in the heart of Boston with many shops and restaurants in close proximity. It was remarkably clean; the beds were comfortable; and the home was spacious enough for seven people to stay comfortably. On the wedding day morning, the bridesmaids gathered at our place, and the upstairs room was perfect for the girls to get ready. When I needed to contact Jason, his responses were prompt and professional. I highly recommend his place to others."

2881388,88581504,2016-07-24,5758965,Laura,"First off, the location cannot be beat - right between Newbury & Boylston Streets, walkable to Back Bay (Orange Line) and Hynes or Copley (Green Line), even walkable to Fenway Park if you're up for a twenty minute stroll. It's close to a lot of great shopping and restaurants, and easy to get to Cambridge, North End, or the waterfront through public transport and/or Lyft and Uber. The brownstone itself is nicely redecorated, and easily fits five to six people, though to access #3 requires two and a half flights of stairs, and then a third flight up to the loft/den space of the third sleeping area. If you have older people or young kids and strollers with you, it would not be ideal. The building is on the old side, so the stairs are creaky and the water pressure in the baths and and showers are weak. The kitchen is well-outfitted with quality appliances and a decent assortment of utensils, plate ware, etc. The beds were very comfortable, and the Internet was fine. Central air cools down the place pretty fast in the summer time. There were not quite enough towels for (eight towels total for five people for five days), but there was a laundry machine in the basement ($2.5 per load to wash or dry). One downside that I don't imagine is normal is that there was daily, extremely noisy utility work right in front of the building from 6am to 9am every morning we were there - I can't imagine that it happens OFTEN, but because it's a primarily commercial area, be aware that the possibility exists that there might be construction noise. Also, on the weekend there's some street noise from bars/restaurants in the area. Jason's pre-arrival and arrival communication was very clear and informative, and he was super responsive when we had an issue with a missing curtain panel - he ordered one from Amazon right away and it arrived that day. I had to put it up myself, as he was out of town, and I think he was out of town most of the week so he never came to check up on it in person. He was good about checking back with me when I texted him about checkout procedures as well. The only real problem we had all week was toward checkout - we checked out promptly at 11am and left our larger luggage in the hallway downstairs, to pick up around 5:00pm before our airport car service would arrive. Because we had three carry-on bags with heavy valuables like our iPads or computers, when I turned in the keys at the office downstairs, I asked if it was possible to leave those in the office instead of the lobby (where other guests, etc, could have access to them). The young woman in the office was very gracious and said it was fine, took me to the back where I personally put them on the side of one room. We..."

Le logement est très propre, bien tenu (draps, serviettes, ustensiles de cuisine permettant des préparations simples). Les meubles et les finitions sont de qualité (joli parquet partout, marbre gris dans les salles de bain). Inconvénient lie au quartier: le bruit (des travaux importants dans la rue pendant notre séjour, poubelles etc..). Mais 2 des 3 chambres donnent soit sur une ruelle, soit n ont pas d ouverture et peuvent être choisies par les light sleepers. A noter: une chambre est aveugle (pas de fenêtre). Seul bémol: la terrasse difficilement utilisable (pas de coussin, trop de meubles), et aucune possibilité d aérer 2 des 3 chambres ainsi que les 2 salles de bain (sans fenêtre ou fenêtre ne s ouvrant pas). La climatisation fait office d aération, dont l utilisation pour des européens n est pas toujours evidente (pas de notice d utilisation). Lave linge et sèche linge payants à disposition au sous sol (pas toujours dispo cependant). Globalement tres satisfaisant."

Jason is fantastic at communicating before and during your stay. He has a great sense of service and genuinely would like you to have a comfortable stay.,,,,,
"The decor and cleanliness of the apartment is as pictured. No surprises.  It has an \"\"executive-Accomodations\"\" feeling overall.  The kitchen has all the basics",we managed to cook daily basic meals for the kids. Trader Joes is around the corner!,,,,
Do note that this is a walk-up,as is the case in most Boston apartment buildings with character and history.  You have 1 set of stairs to get to your flat,then another set inside to get up to the living room.,,,
Jason was kind enough to let us keep our luggage downstairs after check out,which was greatly appreciated.,,,,
We would definitely consider staying here again.  It is a professionally run accommodation.  The location is absolutely fantastic.,,,,,

Jamie's house is located in a fantastic location,safe,walking distance to so many great areas. Food,shopping,and many other things to do nearby,also the train is right by his house.
His house was clean and his roommate Mike was very friendly,we hardly saw him.,,,,
The kitchen is small but we didn't mind it at all,as the last thing we wanted to do was to cook,when there are many amazing near by places to eat.,,,
The house is located on the 4th floor,and the steps are very steep,some may see that as a downside,but we didn't mind that either. All of his neighbors we met were very very friendly.,,
We saw Jamie twice,checking in,and when we left to give the key back. Once you check in you're on your own basically. We asked for a bottle wine opener,and he wasn't able to help out with that. How ever I did leave one for him to have,"so next guest will have one for sure \"",

6324649,45813042,2015-09-06,10576992,Christen,Jamie was perfectly warm and welcoming and the neighborhood was very convenient to public transportation and shopping nearby. I will say that it is a small room with a rather small shared bathroom but a great place to stay if passing through Boston.

It's Not connected to the room, but it's just across the hall. The room was nice, and the bed was pretty comfortable. The only thing is that the window was slightly open with an AC sticking out of it, although somehow the cold air wasn't really coming it, but I did hear some noise from the street. Not a busy street at all, but would've been nice to close the window. But I put in my ear plugs and slept just fine! Also, there was a street light outside the window, so I put on my eye mask as well. Overall, I am super happy with it! Jamie was a great host, and welcomed me warmly into the house, while also letting me do my thing. The house and bathroom were really clean. Definitely a nice place.

At the same time, they were very friendly and very nice to give me any advice of the neighborhood, and were there to accommodate any amenities I need. Cute couple, super local Boston experience! ;)"
Parking: I was lucky to find parking on Gainsbourg just two blocks from their apartment for free. It's 2 hours free parking on weekdays until 6 pm,but they don't really check if you went over (maybe this is a case by case thing). But I managed to park their the whole afternoon from 2pm until the Saturday afternoon,the day after.,,,
Neighborhood: The neighborhood was perfect! I was there for the Berklee Audition,which was just 5 mins walk. There's a cute homie coffee shop at Gainsbourg,just right around the block,where I had my breakfast bagel (VERY GOOD!) And there are CVS pharmacy just 2 mins walk. Very convenient and plenty of restaurants/music shops/old-school barber shop,so you're literally in the heart of Boston! I also took a walk across Charles River,which I really much enjoyed!

The apartment is very cool and cozy with an amazing location.  Right across is the Boston Symphony and its less than a block to a green line T stop.  Downtown is within walking distance and if you are visiting Northeastern University for any reason this is a perfect location since its right next to campus.

The arrangement of the apartment gives good privacy, as the owners' area is in a separate part, so I didn't feel as if I was intruding on their space.  They were nice, considerate hosts, and made me feel welcome. It was ideal for me as I am out most of the time when I visit my son in Boston, and I really just need somewhere to shower, sleep and change.

However, since this is in the center of the city its also in the center of action. First night, a neighbor in the building burnt food on the stove at midnight and fire alarms went off causing everybody to evacuate the building. Fortunately it was nothing major. Safe neighborhood, good restaurants nearby. I stayed for 5 nights but I think its ideal for shorter stays as you have no wardrobe. Another thing to keep in mind is this apartment is on 4th floor with no elevators so be prepared! Overall, I'll chose this place again if I revisit Boston in future."

Although it was not a problem for me, it would be helpful to tell future guests that it is a walk up condominium with no elevator available - could be problematic for someone with luggage. One issue, not in the condo, but in the second foyer of the building, is the step up on the tile floor. It is obvious when entering the building, but not so when coming down the stairs. There is no delineation of the tile step from the tile floor and I sailed off the step on my way out the door, sliding on my knees to the next door!  No injuries, but thinking of someone else who might have been injured. My privacy was ensured and access to the kitchen was easy. Would recommend replacing the ground fault receptacle in the bathroom. The case is new but the receptacle is obviously worn and old. There were some spots on the wall behind the lavatory that could have been cleaned off. The bed was comfortable; however, the microfiber bed linens were hot - cotton would have been cooler."

The room was exactly as advertised and very comfortable. I had my own bathroom across the hallway. The kitchen & living area were shared although I was not there that often to converse with them much but enjoyed them immensely when we did sit and talk. The stairs would be good to know about in the description of the place. I have a bad back and when I got in the foyer and saw them I was concerned but Jamie came running down to carry my suitcase up for me (thank you). It would be a good idea for the maintenance people to place some kind of strip on the stair in the foyer. I too missed it the first time I left and did not fall but certainly noticed it in my back when I slipped. I had tickets to the Boston Pops and so the location was perfect. It was also easily accessible to food. I highly recommend Jamie's place if you are coming to Boston.

The apartment is in a great part of town, just two blocks from the subway Orange line. Parking is limited due to residential permits but I arrived on a Saturday afternoon and got lucky to find street parking 2.5 blocks away.

13864415,86361676,2016-07-16,26505182,Tianran,Comfortable private room as listed. Fairly clean. Very nice location for my trip: it was less than 10min walk to the Westin Boston Waterfront. Within 25min walk to the harbor.
"The only minor problem I had was the squeaking floor and doors. It should be okay as long as other guest don't move too much in the middle of the night.\"",,,,,
13864415,95472629,2016-08-19,89485961,Oda,"Ellen was super nice and welcoming! The communication via email was good and she sent me all the information about how to get in to the apartment upon my arrival. Unfortunately my flight was delayed by 10 hours so I just got to stay at Ellens for a couple of hours, but she was nice enough to give me a late checkout so I got a good rest (I was only going to stay for one night). Grate room, comfy bed, super nice and clean bathroom. Location was nice and easy to get to, I would definitely recommend staying at Ellens place!"
13864415,98115102,2016-08-29,89223528,Douglas,The location couldn't be in a better spot. Easy to walk to the Broadway T station and within steps to all the new fancy stuff in Southie. Room was very clean and bathroom immaculate.
12540640,90538018,2016-08-01,14275491,Irene,Thibaud was really flexible with check in and check out time and really helpful.  Before arriving he sent me messages with indication on how to get to the place and the different prices. He provided map of the city and suggestions on where to go.
The pull out coach was really comfortable and we had no problem sleeping there. The position is not central but the closest metro station is  within 5/7 minutes walk.,,,,,
I would suggest you to stay here if you are looking for a cheap,"clean and comfortable place.\"",,,,

12540640,95645646,2016-08-20,47741347,Feier,"It was a pleasant stay at Thibaud place. The pull-out couch is very comfortable and the same size of normal bed that can sleep 2. The location is super convinent. T is accessible within 5 mins walk. The house overall is clean and cozy. Would definitely recommend if you need a place to crush for a couple of days. Plus, Thibaud is very flexible with the check-in and check out time. Great experience!"
8904297,74543364,2016-05-15,13307414,Vicki,"I didn't get a chance to meet Sandy but I still enjoyed my stay at her lovely house.  Sandy is detail oriented, and made sure the room was perfection by the time we arrived. We were welcomed with a clean room and a personalized welcome sign.  There's plenty of room for storage and complete privacy. Great location. It's not too far from the airport, downtown Boston, and there's a little downtown within walking distance for dinner."
8904297,75728796,2016-05-22,24374544,Liz,The room was beautiful and we all had our own towels and toiletries. Sandy had amazing candles and everything you could need while traveling! Even pelligrino and pot pourie for your suitcase! The house was well maintained and Sandy although not present was very available and communicative. My only complaint is that there was no coffee! Would definitely recommend!
8904297,78176040,2016-06-05,66392118,Steve,"The description and the pictures of this room fit it perfectly. When I opened the door, there was a beautiful note, some sparkling water, and other little amenities waiting for us. It couldn't feel more like home than the comfortable beds, the cozy room, and the lovely shared living & dining areas. It was like stepping into the perfect home away from home. I highly recommend Cozy Double Times II as Sandy did not only provide us with a lovely home for our vacation, but she was also there at a moment's notice through texts & calls if she was needed. I hope all places on Airbnb can be this amazing & all hosts could be as attentive as Sandy. They have a lot to live up to!"

8904297,92527806,2016-08-09,27009425,Andreas,Wir haben Sandy leider nicht getroffen aber die Kommunikation lief schnell und zuverlässig.
Das Apt. fanden wir genau wie beschrieben,sehr sauber und schön. Die Küche haben wir ausgiebig genutzt.,,,,
Die Lage war für uns,die wir Boston erkunden wollten,etwas zu weit außerhalb um mit Bus Und Bahn schnell in die Stadt zu kommen.,,,
"Alles in Allem klar empfehlenswert.\"",,,,,
8904297,93786637,2016-08-14,28851366,Monika,"The apartment of Sandy is really cute. She made us feel comfortable, welcomed us with a personal note, prepared the room nicely and provided water and everything you need in the bathroom."
One problem for us was the long way to the center of Boston,where we spent our daytime. It may be better to stay in her place when you travel by car.,,,,
The neighbourhood is not very inviting to spend the evening there,"after coming home from downtown which takes at least 50 minutes with public transportation.\"",,,,
8904297,95995887,2016-08-21,51774077,Mohamed,"Une expérience cauchemardesque et traumatisante: premièrement, si j'avais su et était informé que la résidence est partagée avec d'autres colocataires, je n'aurais jamais accepté de la louer. Il n’y avait aucune mention de cela dans l'annonce. En découvrant après (et en ouvrant une porte fermée), que la résidence était occupé par d'autres colocataires, mes 2 filles avaient eu la frousse de leur vie et ne voulaient plus dormir dans la chambre. On était obligé de les rassurer longtemps et de passer le maximum du temps en dehors de la résidence et ne revenir que tard la nuit et  juste pour dormir. Le wifi ne fonctionnait presque pas : il se coupait souvent. La seule salle de bain est trop petite et utilisée par plusieurs colocataires. La baignoire n’est pas trop propre et n’avait pas de bouchon pour pouvoir faire un bain. On était obligé de se servir uniquement de la douche de la baignoire. La lumière extérieure de la résidence est brûlée et la nuit quand on rentre pour dormir, on ne voyait presque rien. Une grande poubelle jamais vidée se trouvant juste devant la porte principale d’entrée attirait plusieurs insectes : mouches, abeilles, etc.).Les climatiseurs sont trop bruyants et nous empêchaient de dormir .Le quartier n’était pas calme durant la nuit : les sirènes des véhicules d’urgence retentaient toute la nuit. Le frigidaire commun est plein de la nourriture des autres colocataires et il n’y avait presque pas  de la place pour mettre la notre."

8904297,97849021,2016-08-28,85946121,Thomas,"Magnifique chambre pour 4 munie d'une grande télévision et aussi d'une petite salle de lavage privée. Les toilettes ainsi que le salon et la cuisine sont partagé avec les 2 autres locataires de l'appartement. La plupart des items nécessaire pour cuisiner et pour laver la vaisselle sont fournit.  À 15 minutes de voiture du centre ville de Boston, c'est un emplacement idéale pour utiliser le transport en commun. Belle expérience en général, idéal si cela ne vous dérange pas de partager une partie de l'appartement avec quelques inconnus."
8193344,46095845,2015-09-07,43192511,Moon,"Great experience. Javier is a very attentive host. The place is near many convenient bus lines and T stations, which made getting around Boston simple. And all the great restaurants of South End are literally steps away. The apartment itself is very cool. The bed is comfy and the shower has a nice rainfall faucet."

Since this was not my first trip to Boston,I knew where the apartment is located. It is a very nice area with quiet a lot of restaurants,small stores and supermarkets/pharmacy close to the apartment. Walking distance to Boston Common is around 20 minutes,but there is also public transport available.,,
"I would definitely recommend this room!\"",,,,,
8193344,48761083,2015-09-28,7226235,Ashley,"Javier was a great host! He met us early so we could get out bags into place before going out and about. The condo was very clean and organized as well. Parking was a bit rough, as it's meters or permit parking only, so we did pay to park in the hospital parking garage. Other than that, there were no issues with the condo. Our roommate was very friendly and kept to himself, as did we."
8193344,49152498,2015-10-01,43756950,Honda,Very cozy and great location!
My very first Airbnb experience was amazing!! I miss this place already. When I come back to Boston again,I would come to this place.,,,,
The host,,,,,
Javier was waiting in front of the house when I arrived. He was a very hospitable person. I was well looked after.,,,,,
The place,,,,,
Very spacious neat and clean and stylised place. What else can you ask?,,,,,
The location,,,,,
15 minutes or less from the airport by taxi. ( Fare was $23 ),,,,,
2 bus stops are located near by. You can easily walk to the places like Boston Common or Fine Art Museum.,,,,,
Restaurants and shops. Must go to the flour bakery,and Mikes Diner to experience American style breakfast. Sushi and Thai restaurants cross the road were also nice. Toro was a great place to drink! Also there are Seven Eleven,"pharmacy and supermarket  located near by. I hope you will enjoy the place as much as I did. Thank you Javier so much!!\"",,,
8193344,52405485,2015-10-29,24489432,Marco,"This was a really nice experience. Javier welcomed me and showed me the apartment when I arrived. He was checking on me every day asking how he could make my staying there more comfortable. The apartment was always clean. I stayed for a month and I felt like I was at home. Nice neighborhood, nice roommates. I'd definitely try to stay there again if I'll be back in Boston."
8193344,53154000,2015-11-05,46450183,Liz,Javier was a delight.  His place looks and was exactly as the description/pics on Airbnb.  The fact that it was /is very difficult to find time that this apartment is available to book  is proof in the pudding.
He was helpful in identifying/recommending some of his favorite local restaurants.,,,,,

"I thought Javier was fine but the female guests did not seem to care for him. Be advised. My only problem during my 1 month stay was that the shower was having trouble getting hot my last couple days. That made everyone kinda grouchy.  I would definitely stay again if the shower has been fixed.\"",,,,,
8193344,68543343,2016-04-05,38806717,Monica,Javie is a wonderful host. He is very responsive and attentive. He sent me message before my arrival to confirm my stay and arrival time. On the first day of my stay I had a really bad migraine from travel he provided me some Advil.
"A quick note to the fellow travelers: the house is a charming historical building which also means poor sound insulation. You could hear steps from upper level and activities from another room. \"",,,,,
8193344,70652787,2016-04-19,12639079,Ashley,I had a great time staying at Javier's place in the South End of Boston! I got there easily from Back Bay train station and met him and he showed me around the apartment. The room was clean and the bed was super comfortable and that was precisely what I needed. Thank you Javier for the hospitality! His apartment was a short walk from everything that I was doing during my stay so it worked out great. Thanks again.
8193344,71111984,2016-04-23,39583589,Ben,"Javier is a fantastic host, the room was spacious, clean and comfortable and the flat overall is a great place to stay. The location was   perfect for me as I was attending a conference within walking difference and if you like jogging you can reach the river quickly which I enjoyed several times. Loads of great places to eat locally and Javier was quick to help me find specific information like a place to watch an English football game! Would not hesitate to check availability with Javier first if I return to Boston. Definitely recommend!"
8193344,75459511,2016-05-21,53923052,Yanxu,"Javier's apartment is located in a nice safe neighborhood, with a good diner(Mike's diner), a popular Spanish restaurant (torro), and a fantastic coffee/bakery (Flour) nearby. Supermarket (Foodies) is about 3 blocks down. The metro is a few blocks (about 10-15min) walk on Massachusetts Ave."
He was helpful and very accomodating. I accidentally locked myself out of my room and had to wake him up early in the morning to help me out and he was so chill about it. His apartment is also very well stocked with utensils,so if you're into cooking for yourself you'll have no problems at all. The bed was comfortable and bathrooms were clean.,,,,
Thanks Javier for the wonderful experience,"esp for someone who is doing airbnb for the first time. \"",,,,

Javier was very kind to provide a very warm welcome and made himself available for any questions that I had. I strongly recommend his place and will surely book again when visiting Boston."
8193344,80069704,2016-06-16,32633472,Jared,Great brownstone condo in a great neighborhood. The host made a great recommendation for coffee at a local French style café just 1 block away. There were 2 restaurants that had been featured on the food network within walking distance and I was able to visit both. I loved the instant booking feature since this was a last minute business trip. When I couldn't book a rental car for less than $100 a day I used Uber to get from Logan airport to the condo. It was a great experience and the host even had an ironing board to use.
8193344,81160874,2016-06-21,8799457,Jose Pablo,Is the best place we ever stayed!
8193344,81504786,2016-06-23,54120347,Matthew,"I booked this room for a last-minute business trip, and it was just what I needed. The condo was clean and comfortable, with wifi and plenty of space in the common area. Javier responds promptly and was very welcoming, taking the time to mark up a map showing good places to eat, walk, etc. The location is very convenient to a number of good spots. Would book again."
8193344,86007248,2016-07-14,82215662,Jing,"It was a very clean place, and convenient through the buses (not subways). Although I do suggest two changes in the house rule:"
1. The quiet hour is from 10pm to 7am,which was quite tough for me... I was there for a conference and I had to excuse myself early after the dinner (bus transfers takes longer time at night too)... Even 11pm would be much better...,,,,
2. It was very nice that the host has a washing machine in the bathroom,"but I didn't have detergent and it didn't worth it to buy a whole bottle for just one time use... So it would be nice if there was detergent provided while people with allergy could still be given a caution.\"",,,,
8193344,87691982,2016-07-21,68303317,Bernd,Great Host. I definitely recommend to stay here if you are in Boston.
8193344,89655740,2016-07-29,5267374,Rick,"Javier was a great host, from an outdoor greeting to making sure the toilet paper was restocked.  This is a fabulous apartment.  Beautifully updated.  A great kitchen that was never touched during my week long stay.  A beautiful garden/patio that also was neglected.  I couldn't have been more pleased."
8193344,97233382,2016-08-26,149098,Tracy,Had a lovely stay here. Some communication difficulties but otherwise a smooth experience. Very much a hotel or hostel-like experience. Very comfortable bed and appreciate the air conditioner!
6277566,32668734,2015-05-19,33606014,Victor,"The roommates girls were very friendly. Yi was very responsive on text, most of the time. However, the picture was of the shared living room on the second floor, as opposed to the room we are renting on the third. The description also didn't mention that the queen bed was an air mattress, or that we would be sharing 1 bathroom with 5 people... The room was also very noisy as it faces a very busy street."
6277566,33531109,2015-05-29,18993605,Mélanie,I have not met Yi during my stay but he answered to all my questions.
The house was shared with two Yi's friends,very friendly and helpful. There was also a tiny dog.,,,,
The location of the house was very convenient for me. It is close to HSB campus by walk and around 20min from Harvard station (there is also a bus). The bedroom is ok (just a little bit noisy because of the street),"on the third floor and with a fan (air conditioning). The bathroom was shared with Yi's friends (as explained by Yi before my arrival).\"",,,,
6277566,80100294,2016-06-16,4466303,Charlie,Yi's home has tons of energy and charm. By the end of my stay I felt like part of the family. The location was very convenient for going downtown or heading west on I-90. A great choice for anyone who wants to experience Allston.
7809904,44270825,2015-08-24,1132616,Chris,"Aida was a very nice host.  She communicated clear instructions on entry into her place and accommodated our very late arrival.  She placed two water bottles for my daughter and I on the bed which was very welcome as we had traveled 9 hours on the road before arriving.  I have used AirBNB many times before and this was THE NICEST apartment/condo that I have ever stayed in.  It was clean, modern, well furnished, had secure entry/exit, and was conveniently located.  For the price, it was an absolute bargain in the Boston area.  The location is extremely convenient to the Maverick T stop and to the airport, and the view of Boston is truly amazing as advertised.  I would love to stay here again next time I travel to Boston."
7809904,46001913,2015-09-07,24343098,Ruidi,Aida's apartment is awesome! It's very clean and everything was perfect. Aida told us the detailed information about her apartment and how to get the key. She always be there when we need help. Highly recommended to others!!

7809904,47448644,2015-09-18,19625177,Nikki,"The experience at this place was absolutely fantastic. Aida was very welcoming and friendly. She greeted me when I arrived with a glass of wine and took time to chat. The views from this place are absolutely incredible and the proximity to Logan Airport can't be beat. The house was very clean and comfortable. Aida was available to answer any questions I had promptly before my arrival and during my stay which was a big help. I felt very lucky to have found this place and would definitely stay there again. Thanks for being such a great host, Aida!"
7809904,48136509,2015-09-23,43300186,Angela,"Even though we only stayed for one night, our stay with Aida was wonderful. She was lightning fast at responding to emails before, during, and after our stay, which made coordinating our visit remarkably easy. It was clear that she knew what she was doing and her experience was invaluable to setting us up for what was only our second stay at any AirBNB. We arrived before she got home from work (we got in on a weekday around 4) but accessing the apartment was still a breeze. We met Aida shortly before we went out to walk around the city and find something to eat - she was very friendly and we regret not having the time or energy during our one night to get to know her better. The room was comfy with the bed being the best part....some kind of memory foam magic. The view from the apartment, mainly the living room, is definitely not overrated in the description. Driving may be a bit of hassle just like anywhere else in Boston but there is a T station not far away which would probably be worth looking into if you're going into the city. Overall we had a great night at this location and would recommend it to anybody passing through or looking for a place to stay while they visit Boston."
7809904,48779729,2015-09-28,16181350,Jesse,We had an exceptional experience and Aida's hospitality was phenomenal! I would highly recommend it to anyone! The view was spectacular and Aida gave us a list of everything to do in town which was extremely helpful! The Location is one train stop away from the airport and one stop away from downtown! Highly recommend!

One subway stop from downtown and is conventionally located right by the subway stop & other small local shops. Overall we had a great time staying at her place for 24 hours and had an awesome stay in Boston. Thanks Aida!"
7809904,50422128,2015-10-11,46219205,Cecilia,An amazing place to stay! My friend and I only stayed for a night but really wished we could've stayed longer. Driving in was a breeze and Getting into the apartment was a piece of cake. The apartment.... Beautiful! The view is breathtaking! We unpacked quickly (after taking a couple pictures of the view) and went out to one of the dinner places that was recommended. While walking there we realized the maverick station is RIGHT THERE! Making it easy to get into downtown.  I could go on and on... But I'm sure you get the picture! It's a great place!
"Tip: There is plenty of street parking! Make sure you don't park in resident parking! I saw a tow truck the night we got there and the morning we were leaving. \"",,,,,
7809904,64706232,2016-03-06,49436064,Erika - Landmarc Building,"Wow where to start...This was mine and my boyfriends first time staying through AIRBNB, and I can already say this stay is definitely going to be tough to beat. We had a 5 hour drive in, and with the help of our GPS the place was extremely easy to find. Even though this was in East Boston, the location was absolutely perfect! There were a lot of shops and restaurants super close by and the T Stop to take the Subway is literally right outside the door of the apartment building. Getting into the city was a breeze and that was our first time taking the Subway all by ourselves. We were a little skeptical at first taking the Subway, but I'm so glad we did because it got us familiar with the Subway system and I kid you not, within the matter of just a couple of minutes you're already right in the center of the city. Luckily when we arrived Aida was home, so we did get to meet her and she was super welcoming and showed us where everything was. Right off the bat the first thing you notice when you get there is the view. It is absolutely AMAZING; especially at night. The bed we slept in was awesome! It was definitely one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on for sure! The only thing that was a bit of a pain was having to park in the 2 Hour parking spots. On the weekends (Starting Friday at 6pm-Monday at 8am) the 2 Hour Parking doesn't apply, but during the daytime on weekdays it does; and the cops are definitely out ticketing. We left at 9am on Friday to go into the city to walk around and explore for the day and when we got back around 1pm I had a ticket. The ticket was only $25 which isn't bad at all, but just make sure if you do have to visit during the week, to make sure your're moving your car into a different parking spot every couple of hours during the hours of 8am-6pm (Mon-Fri). Overall our stay was spectacular and we would absolutely stay here again!"

13723404,96056618,2016-08-21,57389551,Chloe,The neighborhood is up and coming so it can get a little sketchy at times but otherwise it was convenient to live at and a very nice place to stay at!
13723404,97239324,2016-08-26,34131519,Graeme,Flat book made me feel very welcome and were there for me throughout this (my first Airbnb) experience.
They answered questions,checked that I arrived safely,reminded me of the checkout process,and even responded to a couple of emails.  Felt like a very personal service.,,
The area was central,within spitting distance of the underground,and most of the important stores,and an Equinox gym which was amazing.,,
"I would certainly use Airbnb again and certainly look to find a property from Flatbook if available.\"",,,,,
8973362,53006303,2015-11-03,15338468,Caleb,"Kate's apartment was just what we needed. The convenience to the T is definitely the biggest selling point. Kate keeps a clean apartment, and it has all the necessities you expect (clean bed, hot shower, full workable kitchen). I was very pleased with the value of the apartment and how easy it was to get around to anywhere in Boston, Cambridge, etc. I had heard some bad things about Mission Hill, but the area of this apartment is near Northeastern and mostly inhabited by college kids. It was Halloween so obviously a lot of the local residents were having a good time, so I guess know that going in, if you are looking for someplace overly quiet. This didn't bother us at all."
8973362,55929144,2015-12-07,6252433,Eunhee,We had really nice time in Kate's airbnb. It accommodates  4 guests spaciously with separate bedrooms and conveniently located right next  to train station.
I need to attend the event at Symphony. It's very close so we are so pleased. Kate is very responsive and welcome us well!,,,,,
"Thank you so much and we love to recommend your place to friends!\"",,,,,

625012,2025623,2012-08-18,3270730,Carol,"Home away from HOme at a friends guest room! That's simply put the way you feel at the paradise,,,G has created of his house. A complete zen oasis of art, color and whimsical decor, pure sophistication that welcomes you into this cozy brownstone. The room is spectacularly decorated and comfortable, with a lovely red chair to sit at and relax,,the bed is an antique piece very classic with rich texture linens and a warm comforter, there's extra pillows and soft fluffy towels. The room has a ceiling fan that cools and circulates the air,,the two windows open to the street giving visitors a taste of what real Bostonian life is like. The closet is big with lots of room to store away luggage plus there is an ironing board and iron in case your clothes get wrinkle,,but that's sure not to happen because of the hangers that will allow you to neatly hang all of your wardrobe. The Jack and JIll bathroom which sits in between the main bedroom and the guest room is beautifully decorated with pieces from around the world and the main attraction is a Photograph of the Bab's herself"

The room, in fact the entire home, was clean, lovely, colorful and cozy, a treat to return to after spending the days walking around Boston.  Gerald also suggested excellent  places to eat, we enjoyed every one!. Also, Skye is a sweet dog!  We  would love to have stayed longer and felt fortunate our time in Boston included our stay with Gerald and Skye"
625012,2682474,2012-10-22,3553775,Yeny,"Gerald is a wonderful host, we had a great time during our stay in Boston. His place is clean, spacious and stylish! The location is great too, it's near one of the main subway stations, so you wouldn't have a problem getting around. He was extremely welcoming, and kind enought to provide me with intructions to and from the bus station, as well as cool spots and restaurants near by to try. Nothing but good things to say, I would love to stay here again!"
625012,2721824,2012-10-26,3551487,Esperanza,This is my first airbnb experience and it has exceeded my expectations.
Gerald is such a nice host,pays great attention to detail. This is seen in the candy he left on my table on my day of arrival,the towels,a hairdrier,ironing board etc,the bagels
He also gave me very good tips as to transportation and places to visit.,,,,,
The check-in process was very smooth as well as the check-out,very uncomplicated. But what I liked most about Gerald is that he makes you feel at home,he is so friendly and,at the same time,so discrete.,
Last,but not least,there is Skye,his Tibetan terrier,lively and friendly,a good company when I arrived at his place.
I definitely recommend Gerald's place,not only for what I mentioned above,but also because of the location and the charming and trendy neighborhood,filled with small cafés and lovely shops!,,
THANKS,Gerald,for making my stay in Boston such a lovely experience!,,,
"Esperanza (HOPE)\"",,,,,
625012,2749761,2012-10-29,2554552,Kim,"We really enjoyed staying in the Back Bay at Gerald's!  His street is picturesque, minutes walk to Newberry and many other great restaurants and site-seeing to do's.  We appreciated the little details, such as dark chocolate bars and yummy gourmet snacks.   Oh, and the jacuzzi in his private courtyard was the cherry on top!  This is a great place to stay for the independent traveler who knows what they want to do and does not mind sharing a bathroom between your room and his (which was never a problem).  I would definitely recommend staying in the Back Bay for future visits to Boston."
625012,2795099,2012-11-03,3956778,Angie,"Gerald was a great host! very attentive, and great communicator!"

Gerald was very welcoming and helpfull already upfront with all the little questions I fired at him by email.,,,,,
Upon arrival I felt at home from the spot. He showed me around and gave me tips what to do and where to go. It was lovely be invited along for the Thanksgiving Dinner at his friends place.,,,,,
"Can recommend him from the bottom of my heart!\"",,,,,
625012,3026646,2012-12-04,4143400,Eva,"Gerald was a very nice, considerate and accommodating host.  His place is beautifully decorated, clean, cozy, and located conveniently to public transportation, restaurants, convenience stores, etc.  His dog Skye was very hyper and talkative while I was there, but I didn't read about that from other reviews, so I'm guessing I have that kind of affect on animals since my family dog was like that before she passed away.  Lol.  If anyone's ever in Boston and is looking for an alternative lodging option outside of booking a hotel room, I'd highly recommend Gerald's!"
625012,3273457,2013-01-05,3192429,Rhiannon,"Our stay with Gerald was flawless - the house is easy to get to, beautifully decorated and well equipped. Gerald himself was extremely generous, helpful and friendly and went out of his way to accommodate us. We wished we had more time there and if we're ever in Boston again we would stay with him again without any hesitation. And he has a cute dog too!"
625012,3724660,2013-03-08,5147663,Kelsey,"Gerald was friendly and flexible, and his place was awesome! The hot tub in the back was particularly decadent. The location was ideal -- easy to get to the T, and pleasant to walk around Copley Square and beyond. The guest bedroom is located by the front door, so it was a little loud in the mornings. But if you are a light sleeper (or wake up early), I am sure you won't notice it. I had full access to the house, and felt fully private in the guest bedroom and bath. Great experience!"
625012,3734645,2013-03-10,2034563,Jana,"Gerald is the best! He was great about communicating, pointed me towards a wonderful bakery, shared some delicious teas, and has a clean, adorable place. Also, even though Skye wasn't sure about me at first, she warmed up (and I loved her from the get-go--she's all adorable fluff). Also, his place is in an excellent location, especially if you are doing anything at Hynes-- but really, just for anything. Highly recommend staying with Gerald!"
625012,3824254,2013-03-18,4356728,Caroline,"If it had been possible, I would have given 10 stars to Gerald. Sincerely. I have always liked my rooms on AirBnB, but this time that was a Whaouh! The place is amazing, with this tiny thing that makes the difference. Just in the middle of the City, a few blocks away from lots of great places. And Gerald was both quiet, helpful, nice ... How many times I would have been lost in Boston without his advice, and his croissants :) ! If you go to Boston, just go to Gerald's place, you'll enjoy the city even more!"
625012,3885750,2013-03-25,683052,Ron,"Gerald was the best host I could think of, always making sure you feel at home, giving great tips and just being a great guy all around. His apartment is pretty much perfectly located, either a three-minute walk from the T, buses and beautiful Copley Square, or just an easy 15-minute walk to downtown Boston (Freedom Trail, et al). Would recommend without a doubt."

625012,4942016,2013-06-03,2456862,Mary,"I found Gerald to be an extremely kind and considerate host. He was forthcoming with advice about how to get around Boston, things to do, convenient and good places to eat. He is also very friendly and chatty. His place is very close to public transport and the middle of Boston. Besides being very artistic and quirky, his place has everything you could want in a place to stay: comfortable bed, plenty of hot water, ceiling fans and a most personable Tibetan terrier, named Skye.  Besides which, he provides bagels or croissants for breakfast and good plunger coffee. I am not at all surprised that he almost continuously hosts Airbnb guests, often attending conferences, as I was. I would recommend this accomodation to anyone wishing to stay in Boston. I have found this a difficult place to stay in the past, but this experience with Gerald has completely changed my mind about this city."
625012,5033507,2013-06-09,5291169,Kellye,"Gerald was the perfect host. His duplex is a gem right in the heart of the South End. It's the perfect jumping off point for everyday exploration of Boston.

He was our personal concierge and got us yummy treats every morning for breakfast. He really did accommodate us to make our stay as comfortable as possible given the heat and humidity in Boston during our stay. As noted on Jerry's listing, this property does not have A/C which is not needed much in Boston from what I understand."

He made my stay in Boston perfect, beginning even before the trip by sending me detailed instructions on how to get there.  He met me on the way from the bus with Skye, (my now second favorite dog in the world) and took me around, showing me the neighborhood and how to get around, where to eat, (the best second hand stores) etc.  The house? Wonderful, he's made it a work of art!  The room was comfortable and beautiful. Gerald really made me feel welcome to eat, drink, watch TV, basically do anything I wanted.  I went to Boston for the American Association of Public Health meeting.  I left with a new friend and lovely memories of Boston."

What a great experience!  If possible,these accommodations are even better than the pictures--and the host was enormously helpful before and during my stay.,,,,
At first I was nervous to book with a shared bath,but because of our scheduling and Gerald's consideration,"there was never \"\"traffic\"\" in the bathroom.  Gerald provided specific and correct directions (so much better than hopstop) for my arrival",met me even though I arrived early,and gave me a tour of both the space AND of the entire neighborhood.  He and Sky hiked me over to my conference site,pointing out landmarks so I wouldn't get lost on my own
Gerald also sat down with a Boston map and made tourist suggestions (as well as some less-touristy finds!).  All his advice was spot on.  I only regret that my responsibilities kept me from enjoying his amazingly-decorated,comfortable space.,,,,

"His place is in a very nice neighbourhood and easy to get to sightseeing places - near to the train station too. I would highly recommend Gerald's place to anyone who wants to visit Boston\"",,,,,
625012,8896535,2013-11-25,8549759,Douglas,"Fantastic! Absolutely no complaints, and just as wonderful as all the previous reviewers suggested.  Gerald was a welcoming and hospitable host, answered my pre-trip queries graciously, provided all the local tips I could want (train logistics, street directions, best restaurants, etc.), and even went out to gather delicious pastries for breakfast.  The condo is perfectly located, easily walkable to much of downtown, only a 5 min stroll from Back Bay train station.  Safe, charming neighborhood.  Terrific in all ways -- I would be delighted to stay here again on any future trip."
625012,9072654,2013-12-04,2095366,Terrence,"Staying at Gerald's place was a great experience.  Gerald is one of the most gracious hosts I have meet. The hot tub was amazing. He provided fresh pastries in the morning, was really good at orienting people people from out of town. The way he has decorated his home is interesting and unique. You can't help feeling nothing but relaxed in his space. I would definitely want to stay here again!"
625012,9234568,2013-12-15,388455,Francisco,"Gerald goes over the board to make your stay a special one. He will have the most delicious pastries in town ready for your arrival and will put everything in his kitchen available for you (coffee, tea, drinks etc.) The place is located in South End (one of Boston's nicest neighborhoods) and is walking distance away from Backbay. The room itself is nice and cozy. It was perfect for my needs."
625012,9491844,2013-12-31,6870766,Charmaine,"Staying in Gerald's place was wonderful! The location was great, given that the apartment was really close to lots of good restaurants and cafes, as well as Back Bay station. The apartment itself is cosy and decorated beautifully. Gerald was very hospitable and even bought us a really lovely spread of pastries for breakfast. Skye, his Tibetan terrier, is also adorable and very friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston."
625012,10408568,2014-02-17,388455,Francisco,"Gerry is one of the best hosts I have stayed with. He makes sure you have the best experience staying at his place. Also, he was very understanding of my very late check-in need."
625012,10623839,2014-02-28,12236852,Elizabeth,"Gerald was a total sweetheart, bending over backwards to make sure I was comfortable. The room was cozy, quiet and warm, the bathroom squeaky clean, and he even brought me a scone for breakfast every morning! This was my first visit to Boston, and I was in good hands. It's also a fantastic location, with public transport and a zipcar lot nearby and a lot of really cute shops and restaurants. I would definitely stay with him again!"
625012,10816367,2014-03-09,9797393,Josie,"Gerald is a wonderful host! The place is very easy to find, in a quiet and charming neighborhood with lots of great restaurants (about which Gerald was extremely knowledgeable) and convenient access to a cool part of Boston. The room is quiet and comfortable, and Gerald generously bought the tastiest pastries in the mornings! Skye is also a charmer :) I will definitely look Gerald up again if I happen to be traveling through Boston."
625012,11071917,2014-03-19,8845877,Donal,"\"Gerald was a very pleasant and helpful host. His apartment is literally 2 mins walk to Back Bay \"\"T\"\" Station on the Orange Line so easy to access anywhere in Boston.Great for me as it was only a short ride to the TD Garden where i got to see my Bruins and Celtics play. Easy to get to and from the airport aswell. The apartment is lovely situated on a quite street. You will have your own room"
625012,11295266,2014-03-29,8556617,Kimberley,"Gerald is a lovely host, incredibly helpful to tourists. Gave us a map and recommendations. Saved us a lot of time finding yummy restaurants! Would definitely stay there again! Room was spacious, clean and comfy.  And offered us tea and brekky!!"
625012,11533177,2014-04-07,11428382,David,"I am new to AirBnB, and this experience makes me want to return -- both to AirBnB and to South Bay in Boston. The accommodation was very nice and Gerald (along with his little dog Sky) was a great host. It was comforting to have someone who knew the city and area giving me a map and advice on transportation, historic sites and restaurants. I had yogurt and granola in the morning and then Gerald and Sky sent me off with a fresh scone (from their morning walk to the bakery) in a bag to eat at my conference. The neighborhood provided easy access to transportation, restaurants and city sites, and it was a comfortable walk to the Public Gardens and Boston Commons. At much less than the cost of a hotel by the Convention Center, I had a nice place and really got to experience Boston."
625012,11658220,2014-04-11,11535243,Silke,"Staying here was just wonderful. It's a lovely apartment in a great location and Jerry was super helpful. Arrangement were very smooth and it was just a million times better than staying at the Marriot Copley (where I spent the first two nights). I felt very well looked after (great pastry, full fridge, enthusiastic dog greetings) while at the same time able to do whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. This was my first air bnb experience and it'll be very difficult to top it!"
625012,11792463,2014-04-15,9106733,Thierry,We had a great time at Gerald's appartment  which is extremely well located and comfy. Gerald met us every morning at breakfast and gave us useful information about restaurants (you know are French people are....) and things to do. His dog is lovely. We recommand warmly this adress.
"\"",,,,,
625012,12108145,2014-04-23,4741234,Heather,"A cozy room with all the extras in a great part of town. Gerald had tips for amazing places to eat out and things to do around town.  Only blocks from the nearest T station and a nice walk to the Public Gardens, Copley Square and more, we couldn't have asked for a better spot."
625012,12485039,2014-05-04,6616885,Seung Yong,"I had business in the center of Boston, so I decided to stay at Gerald's place for three days, and my stay was perfect. Very close to the center (Copley square) and other life savers, such as restaurants and bars. His place, more than anything, is very comfy, charming, welcoming, and well managed."
And he gave me a lot of information about the area as a local and was very kind.,,,,,
I will definitely stay at Gerald's place next time I visit Boston.,,,,,
"Highly recommended ! :)\"",,,,,
625012,12972794,2014-05-16,12839646,Carol,"Gerry was a terrific host. I chose this place after reading all the glowing reviews and was not disappointed. After showing me around the apartment we sat down with a map of the area and he helped me find all the best restaurants and tips on getting up to Cambridge and over to the museums. The place was lovely and bright. South End is a great neighborhood and I felt comfortable walking around at night. It was just a leisurely 20 minute walk from the Hynes Convention Center, which made it perfect for attending my conference. This was my first experience with Airbnb, and I only hope later hosts will be half as good."
625012,13028927,2014-05-18,6570005,Lynn,"Gerald is a great host- kind, knowledgable and fun to talk with. Flexible and easygoing too!"
The duplex is comfortable and clean,and full of interesting things (with good stories @ their acquisition). The location is very convenient,the neighborhood charming and safe..,,,
I started my visit with a lovely walk around the neighborhood with Gerald and Sky,his tibetan terrier. Gerald provides a great orientation and many recommendations for dining and entertainment.,,,,
I highly recommend this host and property.,,,,,

625012,13139473,2014-05-20,13156167,Sophie,"Gerald was extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful - his brilliant apartment was the perfect location for our adventures in central Boston, and the fresh scones he provided for breakfast were delicious! Gerald was very open and generous with his home, and we would highly recommend him."
625012,13266081,2014-05-24,9458246,Melissa,"Gerald was a great host, very easy to chat too, very accomodating, full of helpful information. Sky his puppy is hilarious, and kept us entertained. Position of duplex great, easy walk to everything. Nice neighbourhood. All our expectations met. It was a pleasure to have met Gerald on our adventures."
625012,13470307,2014-05-28,1123073,Joy,"Gerald was a wonderful host. Each morning we woke up and he had stocked the fridge and brought baked goods for breakfast which was a wonderful way to start the day. It was wonderful to meet him and have some conversation. Skye, his dog, is a great companion in the apartment too. The shared bathroom was not a problem for us at all."

625012,14115223,2014-06-12,10088049,Bryce,I highly recommend Gerald's place. The pictures accurately describe the real life experience. The room is spacious with adequate closet space and a very comfortable bed. The treats he left for me in the morning were delicious and his dog Sky was well behaved. Gerald's place is within walking distance to the majority of Boston's must see destinations ... Gerald's hospitality is next to none and communication was easy ... Would stay here again.
625012,14549538,2014-06-22,3392574,Susan,Many thanks to Gerald for ensuring that my first visit to Boston was a great success.  We shared a walk to the museum and a special dinner out at a nearby favourite restaurant.  I was given ample guidance in finding all the sights of interest to me.  Back Bay and Gerald's home together provided me with a delightful and comfortable backdrop for a week in Boston.  Enthusiastically recommended!
625012,14813494,2014-06-27,11073830,Marloes,"It was an absolute pleasure to stay with Gerald and his dog Sky. Gerald is a highly hospitable host who made sure we would have a great time. Giving us the best advice on where to eat, restaurant Coda for a burger and steak (best taste!) and Myers+Chang for Asian style, delicious cooking. Every morning the most yummie pastries were waiting for us in the kitchen and we could make coffee and take anything we would like from the fridge. The location is also perfect, in a nice neighborhood and with many sights in walking distance. Boston is a walking city anyway, although we can also recommend doing the Duck tour which was so much fun. The apartment is very clean and has everything you could possibly need, Gerald even provided things like rain ponchos, umbrella,  local restaurant and activities information etc. Enjoying a relaxed morning in the hot tub in the garden really was the icing on the cake of our stay with Gerald. Highly recommended!!"
625012,15120264,2014-07-02,13348589,Anouschka,Gerald was a friendly and very accommodating host.  I had a busy schedule so I didn't get to see much of him but he still managed to leave me some lovely coffee and the best scone ever for breakfast.  Gerald was also very quick to respond to any questions I had and his home was lovely and as advertised.  I hope to see Gerald and little Sky the dog again one day soon.
625012,15259875,2014-07-06,1140307,Lynn,"OMG, Gerald's place was a treat.  The location, breakfast pastries and restaurant recommendations from Gerald were spot on.  Breakfast time was at our will.  Gerald was available and helpful when we needed help.  Our bedroom was small but very cozy and suitable for our needs.  We shared a bathroom with Gerald along with a kitchen and family room.  Gerald opened his home to us 100%.  The interior is decorated with such detail and was really entertaining to see all the cool art, wallpaper and his collectiables throughout his home."
625012,15905919,2014-07-18,894520,Svetlana,"I absolutely loved the apartment! Everything was as described and even better. I stayed for 7 days, and every day I had fresh pastries from bakery nearby (worth visiting too!) brought by Gerald in the morning. I was very nice :) And the kitchen is fully equipped so you can cook if you want. I think it is a very good choice to stay for 1 or 2 persons. It is close to Hynes Convention center, where the conference I attended was held, and also close to downtown. I would love to come back one day!"
625012,16609649,2014-07-30,13691566,Pernille,Gerald is a very friendly and caring host. He serves a good breakfast.

Simple, sensible accommodations {c’mon it’s a place to sleep!} in the most charming, architecture-rich South End neighbourhood, with Gerald out fetching Flour Bakery fresh pastries for us at the crack of dawn to go along with his press-coffee. Great start to each day!"
Gerald’s home is an interesting,eclectic & enjoyable spot from which to hit the streets for exploration,fun & relaxation. Boston was soooo . . . friendly,can’t wait to return & we’ll be looking forward to staying with Gerald again,to enjoy his quiet kindness & his lively best-pal Skye the wonder-terrier {watch your pastries!!},
There's a nice private entrance,transit is nearby if you're inclined,Gerald is most welcoming,knows the 'hood,we were offered run of the place but we hit the streets daily & looked forward to 'home' every evening.,
Loved the dog. Highly recommended.,,,,,

625012,17500547,2014-08-13,12997990,Briony,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and Gerald could not have been a better host. From walking me through the map of the area pointing out the locals tips and tricks, to leaving a pastry out for me each morning, it was an absolute pleasure to stay. The location is also great - the South End is fantastic for food and music, and other areas of Boston only a 10-15 min easy walk away. Would definitely stay again"
625012,18029713,2014-08-20,16352293,Haishan,"I had a really great time at Gerald's place. Mr. Gerald was very hospitable. Due to flight issues, we were only able to arrive at 1:30 in the morning, but Gerald was so kind to help us settle down. He also prepared detailed tour guides with maps the next morning. We really appreciate his help."
The house has fantastic decorations,and the love puppy is a big plus. Last but not the least,"we have delicious pastries every morning! I would definitely recommend Gerald's place!\"",,,

625012,18711317,2014-08-31,15895133,Robyn,I came to Boston by myself to move my daughter into college. I booked a week at Gerald's home.  Gerald was the most incredible host. His home was so warm and welcoming and in a beautiful neighborhood. He provided delicious pastries every morning along with some wonderful tea. He provided a detailed map of the city and directions to all locations. I didn't rent a car and Gerald's home was perfect for me to walk the city (never took a taxi).  I loved his dog Skye and feel like I have a friend for life. I only wish I could have stayed longer. I will not stay anywhere else on my next visit to Boston
625012,18946547,2014-09-03,7907851,Danielle,"My sister and I decided to book a weekend trip to Boston. After some convincing, she finally agreed to an Airbnb stay (her first, my sixth). I had a great feeling about Gerald from the second he messaged me, and I couldn't wait to meet him. My intuition (and the glowing reviews) was spot on... he is an absolutely wonderful host! I have never had a bad experience *knock on wood* with Airbnb, however, Gerald (& Skye) takes hosting to a superstar status(URL HIDDEN)"
The duplex is clean,zen and eclectic perfection. We especially loved the hot tub after a long day of exploring... it was the perfect end to perfect days. The room was clean,cozy and private,and the brand new bed delivered during our stay was very comfortable.,,
The neighborhood is fantastic. It's in south end,on a cute little block close to Back Bay and central to everything your heart could desire. We found it very easy to get around and we felt completely safe walking at night.,,,,

All the good spots to eat, visit, organise washing etc were all shared. The location is great, close to many interesting sights and I would stay again if I were visiting Boston."
625012,19866151,2014-09-20,8519281,Stephanie,I was in Boston for a marketing conference and stayed 5 nights at Gerald's place. It was my 5th Airbnb experience and one of the most memorable.
The reviews on this page are truly spot on - Gerald is an excellent host,taking the time to not only draw me a route on a map to the conference but give me a little walk around the neighbourhood (with his dog Skye) and point out some of his favourite local shops. I'm not a dog person by nature,but Skye was absolutely lovely to be around. The South End location was fantastic - a short walk from pretty much anywhere you'd want to be and lots of great looking restaurants and cafes nearby.,,,
One thing I always look for in accommodation when I travel is a bit of personality,something colourful,and Gerald's whimsical place matched that definition perfectly. I enjoyed hearing the stories of where he acquired some of the artwork on his walls and how he found many of the interior design pieces in second hand shops or on ebay. My favourite part of the house was all of the amazing wallpaper. There's also a great little garden in the back - very private with a hot tub (that I wish I had the time to use but didn't).,,,
Gerald really goes the extra mile to extend his hospitality and offer a local's advice. Even when I left for the conference just after 7am,he'd gone out ahead of time to buy me a scone or some other delicious treat for breakfast. A great way to kick off a long day and a comfortable bed to go home to in the evenings.,,,,
"I will definitely stay here again on future Boston trips. Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
625012,20004729,2014-09-22,13547373,Carolyn,"My host Gerald was so helpful to me on my first real trip to Boston.  I was there two nights, attending a wedding, and Gerald sat down with me upon my arrival and gave me a map, marking everything I should see in the Back Bay.  He suggested an excellent Chinese restaurant and helped make my exploring that night so comfortable.  The next morning I had a lovely breakfast there - scone, juice, yogurt and coffee - and he helped me plan my morning.  The wedding was that afternoon, and he walked me to the church with his dog.  I highly recommend this listing, particularly because of Gerald and the excellent neighborhood.  I will definitely go back if I am in Boston again."
625012,20405136,2014-09-29,12605988,Nina,"Recently returned from a six night stay with Gerry and Skye.  Loved the location - the street is lovely (and quiet enough to sleep with the window open at night) and so easy to get to the main sights, either walking or hopping on the T just up the road."

Gerald tager sig tid til både at få én til at føle sig hjemme, men lægger også stor vægt ved at fortælle om Boston. Første aften vi kom, hev Gerald et kort frem hvor han tegnede og fortalte om steder der skulle ses samt anbefalede restauranter og caféer (de var gode!!!). Han skaber en god balance mellem at være social, men uden at være påtrængende."
Lejligheden ligger super centralt,med små 10-15 minutters gå gang til super hyggelige parker,indkøbsområder samt restauranter og barer. Værelset var tilpas stort med direkte adgang til et delt badeværelse/toilet. Resten af lejligheden var der fri adgang til (køkken,stue,TV osv) så man kan også sagtens nyde et par timer i et ægte Bostonian hjem. Hver morgen stod der 'pastries' fra den lokale bager klar,samt te og kaffe til at blive lavet. Derudover var der fint udvalg af yoghurt
"Vi var super tilfredse med vores ophold og Gerald er den perfekte vært til et par dage i dejlige Boston. Næste gang vores veje kommer her forbi vil vi klart booke hos Gerald igen.\"",,,,,

The apartment is exactly as listed, and Gerald's generosity in sharing his home, his time and his knowledge of the neighborrhood and Boston in general could not have been better.

Gerald took his time to explain the city and made several recommendations for those seeking site seeing adventures. I would highly recommend anyone staying in Boston over the summer to stay at his location due to hospitality not to mention its central location.
625012,28561648,2015-03-26,1618594,Charlene,"The room was comfortable and Gerald was welcoming.  The room temperature was perfect - while it was freezing weather outside.  I couldn't get the shower to warm up all the way but it was okay.  The location is convenient to Hynes Convention Ctr - a 13 minute walk.  Gerald is thoughtful about details, e.g. the delicious morning pastries, a map with your location marked, various boston tour books in the room.  I would stay again."
625012,28709007,2015-03-29,6570005,Lynn,"This was my second stay at Gerald's place. He is a terrific host- thoughtful, great company, very helpful. We shared a few fabulous meals (Barcelona, Myers and Chang). I had the best brussel sprouts ever!"
His place is really comfortable and was very convenient to the conference I attended at the Copley Marriot. It's a great neighborhood!,,,,,
"I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Boston and it was a pleasure to stay with Gerald again.\"",,,,,
625012,29158670,2015-04-05,22092575,Natalia,"Mi experiencia fue muy buena. Gerald fue amable y nos explico todo lo que podiamos hacer en nuestra estadia, nos dio un mapa para que nos movieramos mejor. Siempre nos dejo cafe y facturas."
La casa esta bien ubicada a unas cuadras de south station,"el vecindario es muy lindo.\"",,,,
625012,30031853,2015-04-16,2676005,Jj,"Everything was perfect. The host, the room, the home, the location...couldn't have asked for anything better. I would highly recommend this location for anyone."
625012,30437328,2015-04-22,20799117,Al,This was my first airbnb experience and won't be my last!
For Boston,this place is a great Location!  It is a very quite neighborhood,very close to the metro,"and easy walk to the commons.  Great restaurants very close by.  Gerald was very hospitable and accommodating \"",,
625012,30761166,2015-04-27,26922540,James,"I had a great experience.  Host is very  considerate and easy.  Location is great and in close walking distance from Boston Common, back bay, and south end sights."
625012,31423337,2015-05-05,26175869,Grazina,"\"May daughter and I decided to spend time touring in Boston.  We opted for a B&B as they are much more personal.  We were delighted with Gerald and \"\"Sky\"\" (pet dog) welcoming us to their home.  Arrangements for our arrival were taken care of and Gerald was very helpful in offering suggestions on the sights and restaurants in the city."
"The South End neighborhood is fantastic - Tremont just several blocks away has some fantastic bars and restaurants.  Walking distance to all major sights in Boston.\"",,,,,
625012,31626285,2015-05-08,24297300,Kevin,"Great location, quirky home, and Gerald's friendly hospitality made our stay memorable. We spent most our time sightseeing, but what little time we spent with Gerald made us feel welcomed and at home. He took the time to give us a run down of Boston, and anything else we needed. Thanks Gerald."
625012,32002288,2015-05-12,24247321,Marcus,I stayed with Gerald for my first ever visit to Boston and immediately felt welcome when he provided a geographic introduction and restaurant/activity recommendations when I first walked in the door. The space is beautify decorated and feels like home - complete with pastries delivered every morning by the host. I hope to be back soon.
625012,33644133,2015-05-31,4235380,Stefan,"\"Gerald is a very warm hearted host and a good city guide as well. My stay was for vacation occasion during one week. The room is well located and very accessible to the \"\"T\"\" in the Back Bay Neighborhood. I got good hints and tips from Getald to make my stay an unforgettable one. Don't miss the pizza and the ice cream at Picco/tremont st :) I recommend Gerald's place to anyone visiting Boston. Save money!\""
625012,34127633,2015-06-05,29857754,Marietta,I had a great stay with Gerald and Skye (pet dog)! Gerald is a lovely host and a great guide. He gave me a lot of tips about places to visit and some great restaurants. The location of his house is perfect. It is very close to the Back Bay station and the city centre. The room is very nicely decorated and everything (from the arrangement for my arrival to the fresh pastry every morning) is well taken care of. I would definitely recommend Gerald's place for a great stay in Boston!
625012,35066796,2015-06-15,28428422,Trina,"Gerald was incredibly hospitable and made his home our home during our stay. This was our first airbnb experience, and it was a truly positive one, indeed. I will be using him again during my next visit to Boston, whenever that is! :)"
625012,36170374,2015-06-26,29145141,Loredana,"Had a great time staying with Gerry and Skye! Perfect location to walk almost everywhere in the city, and the pastries each morning were amazing!!"
625012,38990580,2015-07-20,7447084,Katie,Excellent location and wonderful host!  We were in town for a wedding and loved the super cute room.  We are able to walk to many locations and Gerald was very helpful.
625012,40070477,2015-07-28,21306678,Marco,"I have explored Boston on bike for 3 days. Fun! Very near Jerry's place there is a bike rental. The room is just fine. Nice part of town. For me visiting JFK Presidential Library and Museum was just great to do. Supermarket and restaurants nearby, Shopping? Newbury street!"
625012,46519979,2015-09-11,20495730,Rondo,Was great time there ! Really great location and Gerald is so nice!
625012,48014971,2015-09-22,4083210,Morgan,"Jerry was a great host and made my stay very comfortable.  He recommended some great local spots to eat and explore the city.  The apt location in Back Bay is very convenient, central to transport and a short walk to cafes, restaurants, shopping and more.  The room was clean and as described.  Jerry opened up his kitchen and living room and offered up some delicious local treats with coffee in the morning. Would recommend staying at Jerry's place if you're in Boston."
625012,48741058,2015-09-28,34010243,Cassandra,"Gerald was a wonderful host.  Very kind and thoughtful, he really made it feel like home.  Skye and Zipi were a delight too, Zipi had a fun little puppy attitude, and Skye was low key and friendly."
The location was the best.  Easy to find,charming street,and  perfect little neighborhood.,,,
The space was cozy and just perfect for what we needed.  Again,ideal location and great value.  Private entrance as mentioned and use of the condo as well,hot tub included which was perfect after long days of walking.,,,
The only complaint I can think of was delivery men dropping off a large item into the building which oddly just happen to  early morning trash man.  It was a double whammy back to back.  Obviously though,that cannot be controlled,and on such a small street there is no way to avoid that.  I would definitely stay here again without a doubt though,just maybe some ear plugs for garbage day,"ha ha.\"",
625012,48979700,2015-09-30,169529,Leslie,Great location and there could not be a more generous host.  Gerald accommodated our late arrival without a hitch and brought us great goodies for breakfast and even for our outgoing flight the day we left.   Gerald knows the city well (we're natives so we could tell!) and makes terrific recommendations.  All in all a very nice stay.
625012,49689582,2015-10-05,23410054,Vybhav,"Staying with Gerald was wonderful. He made be feel very welcome. The room was as expected with access to a semi-private bathroom. The neighborhood was very safe, and it was a 10 minute walk to Copley Plaza."
Gerald had great recommendations on places to eat and things to do during my visit. He even brought pastries from local bakeries every morning -- a very thoughtful gesture. Overall,"I had a great stay and would definitely stay with Gerald again without hesitation. \"",,,,

12738641,73471724,2016-05-08,66878269,Troy,"Ben was willing to work with my schedule as I was coming in late off of a flight. He provided me with access to the room as well as comfortable amenities. I had a lot of room, loads of places to charge up my depleted devices (thanks for the power bar. it was a lifesaver!) and a warm and comfortable bed."
The neighbourhood was safe and was quite close to the Broadway station on the Red Line. This was my influencing decision as my visit to Boston was to access points along the Red Line.,,,,,
I was able to communicate with Ben via phone and text throughout the stay. He was very accessible as a host.,,,,,
Over all,"great experience! Thanks for everything!\"",,,,
12738641,77892590,2016-06-04,24843429,Valentine,"Ben and his roommates made it very easy to check in and get settled. I spent most of my time away, only returning to sleep and shower."
The room and apartment were clean and tidy. The neighborhood is safe and quiet,I had several late night bus rides and walks from the Red line to the house and was fine.,,,,
"Overall the place was perfect for me since I wanted a private bedroom and reasonably close to the T. \"",,,,,
12738641,78340752,2016-06-06,47647636,Chris,"Good spot close to some nice restaurants and bars on Broadway St. Ben's roommates weren't around when I was there, but it didn't seem like there would be any problems if they were."
12738641,79179127,2016-06-11,37195674,Billy,"Ben was a very kind host, and made sure the room was comfortable. His roommates when they were around were very friendly, and happy to engage in fruitful conversation. The apartment itself is walking distance to a lot of shops, bars, restaurants, etc. He even accompanied me to the nearby liquor store to buy bottles to pregame for the evening downtown. Would highly suggest this listing for anyone staying the weekend and trying to enjoy some nightlife in Boston."
12738641,84019249,2016-07-05,37336982,Songyang,"Ben is a very helpful host, and he keeps his room clean and tidy. The location is also good, 15min walk to subway station and a few minutes to several bus stops. I enjoy my stay at Ben's place."
12738641,89938352,2016-07-30,4344725,Nate,"I didn't get a chance to meet Ben in person as he was traveling. He was nice, very responsive, and put me in touch with one of his roommates who allowed for a smooth check-in process."
"The place is a great: Clean and tidy with a comfy bed (Queen?) I would highly recommend this place. \"",,,,,
932853,4227936,2013-04-20,1343536,Rob,"I stayed with Jason for about 5 days.  Working most of the time, I was able to come back and relax at his place during the evenings.  The apartment is very nice - clean, modern, very comfortable and he's done an excellent job with renovation.  The kitchen is very large and has all the necessary appliances and tools to cook with.  It opens into the living room which has a large flat screen with cable and a comfortable couch.  The bedroom also has a flat screen in it with a small private bath and very comfortable bed.  Jason as a host is very friendly and accommodating.  He communicates well.  He was polite and conscientious of my time and needs.  The neighborhood is quiet and has a sense of community and openness - the neighbors were friendly and Jason knows everyone well.  Everyday I would take public transportation to get to work - just a short 3min walk to a T bus stop and about a 20min bus ride to the Longwood Medical area.  I was looking for housing during my stay and found JP to be well-situated to getting around by car to other areas of the city.  The neighborhood has everything you need though with a market just up the street along with several restaurants and bars.  Great place!  I would definitely stay again."
932853,16251838,2014-07-24,16047607,Frederick,"Having just arrived from overseas, I stayed at Jason's house for a month as I searched for a more permanent accommodation. It was a great and wonderful experience. The house, which is in a safe and quiet neighborhood, is very clean, tastefully furnished and has a modern interior decor and feel to it. With just less than 5min walk to the Green St. train station, commuting downtown to Boston is a bliss. Shops, pubs, restaurants and commuter bus-lines are all about 5min walk away. Jason is friendly and respectful and will go out of his way to ensure that your comfort is guaranteed. Even when he traveled abroad, he would still communicate despite having made all the local arrangements for my wellbeing before he left. I highly recommend staying at Jason's."
932853,19811459,2014-09-18,8527749,Jim,I appreciate the last minute booking and the flexible hospitality. JP is a charming neighborhood. Glad I was introduced to it. Very sorry I didn't have more time to visit.
932853,19908415,2014-09-20,5743947,Barry,"The lodging was as described, and Jason was friendly and helpful.  The bedroom was clean and orderly, as was the newer shower and bathroom. I had a very comfortable sleep both nights.  It was a nice quiet neighborhood, but fairly close to JP restaurants."
932853,21154999,2014-10-12,21643037,Ann,"Jason made me feel extraordinarily welcome. He answered a number of questions before I arrived about his location and transportation from his place to other places in Boston, which was super helpful. He was very accommodating to my late arrival, and he left notes in the room for how to work everything from the TV to the (fabulous) shower. The room and private bath are lovely and the bed is so comfy, with beautiful linens. I slept like a log, which I never do away from home! The little welcome gifts in the room were a lovely touch and much appreciated after a long day traveling across the country!"
If you're not familiar with Boston,"the location is more convenient than it looks - just a couple minutes' walk to the T and a couple more minutes (in the other direction) to good bus service. I felt completely comfortable walking back from the bus by myself late at night.\"",,,,

He responded quickly to any communication I sent, the expectations (schedules etc) of my stay in his condo were clear and he was flexible in accommodating my schedule. He sent me clear directions to find his place, which is close to many restaurants and stores in Jamaica Plain and to the T. His place is very nice, clean and neat. Nice size room, good bed and bathroom. He left helpful notes explaining how"

932853,30415012,2015-04-21,25194765,Freddy,"Wow! I don't think I could have found a better host! From the get go, Jason was so attentive & responsive. His place is exactly as described. He hosted me for a very important occasion and I couldn't help but spend the weekend telling friends & family about my incredible AirBNB host! Truly a great person who went above and beyond to make me feel at home. Jason, THANK YOU! Hopefully I'll see you same time next year!"

932853,33693612,2015-05-31,12905061,Karen,Great experience at Jason's place. Everything was quite clean and location was within easy walking distance to JP's Center Street with lots of food choices. Jason was a great host and even left some JP treats for us- a very nice touch!
932853,34253062,2015-06-06,24196048,Rich,"We booked a three night stay at short notice and Jason was very accommodating and replied quickly to our emails. Jason was a nice, friendly guy and happy to help or answer any questions if needed. The room was immaculate and Jamaica Plains is a lovely neighbourhood with beautiful houses, parks and a nice selection of shops and restaurants just around the corner.  Worth staying just to get a feel for a lively, arty community that you may not usually see when travelling to Boston. The 'T' station (orange line) is 5 minutes walk and to get to Downtown Crossing in the middle of Boston only takes around 15 minutes."
932853,34671440,2015-06-10,28331644,Frank,"Jason was very welcoming, and the place was as described. The bedroom was kinda smallish compared to a hotel room but it beat paying exorbitant hotel rates downtown!"
932853,49431231,2015-10-04,36744834,Filipa,"Casa e quarto confortáveis e acolhedores, de acordo com a descrição. A casa está numa optima localização, num bairro simpático e sossegado, proximo de restaurantes, cafés e transportes públicos."
Anfitrião simpático e disponível,sempre atencioso e comunicativo. Senti-me sempre bem e em casa durante os quase dois meses de estadia.,,,,
"Sem dúvida um bom local para ficar e explorar Boston. Recomendado.\"",,,,,
932853,50695112,2015-10-13,30341940,Haotian,"The overall experience is good. Everything is clean. Jason was not home during my stay and his housemate was not home for most time of the day. The location is great, very close to the subway station and you can go to downtown very easily."
The room is as what you can see from the photo. As another person pointed out,the room is not big,or rather small for two people because you don't have a space to sit. But you can use the living room. Bathroom is very clean too. You might feel it a bit small when use the toilet. But overall it's good.,,,
After we checked out and back to our home,Jason pointed out that the bottom sheet was bleached and requested a compensation from resolution center. But since we don't use any chemical things on our body and only drink water in the bedroom,"it can not be caused by us. Jason took the explanation and canceled the request. I hope Jason had found out the real reason. \"",,,
932853,54554855,2015-11-21,48512822,Eric,"The room was quite nice, like an upscale hotel room but in a beautiful older Boston home. Very quiet. Jason was a perfect host. I would definitely stay there again."
932853,70757254,2016-04-20,14906134,Sam,"Jason was an amazing host!!! I was in town for the Boston Marathon and he had left Gatorade in the room and a kind note welcoming my wife and I. Such a great room and private bath in a great part of town. So easy to get around. Room was spotless and bathroom was well stocked with soap, shampoo, lotion and towels. Kitchen had everything you would need if you wanted a night in. Unfortunately never got to meet Jason during our stay but he checked in via text daily to make sure we were doing alright. Would definitely stay here again."
932853,72813315,2016-05-04,66442092,Chris,"Perfect stay! Very clean, tidy and comfortable. Jason is super friendly and helpful; the washing machine broke down while we there and he paid to have all our clothes cleaned, dried & folded and even spoke to the dry cleaners to make sure it was ready in time. A nice peaceful neighbourhood too with places to eat nearby. Highly recommended!"
2410846,14226323,2014-06-15,14056583,Anabel,"El apartamento está muy bien ubicado, todo limpio y en buen estado y el anfitrión muy amable. Vale la pena"
2410846,19724827,2014-09-17,5467992,Saint-Clair,"As we were going to stay in the apartment for several days with our 8-months-old baby, my wife and I were a little concerned it could not meet our expectations, but the apartment turned out to be exactly as described. It is not very large, as one can see in the photos, and not very modern (as it is in a historic site), but the bed is very comfortable, internet is fast, and it's cosy, clean and proper to accommodate a small family like ours. The location is obviously the highlight. The apartment is walking distance to many Boston attractions (State House was our next-door neighbor!), T stations, restaurants, coffee shops and stores. Because of this central location, though, it can be a little noisy sometimes, but we probably felt it harder cause we were with our little baby."
At the concierge,the staff was always friendly and very helpful.,,,,
We would like to thank Elyne,our hostess,for beeing so attentive,since our first message and during all our stay,and for offering some very helpful hints about the area. She even offered herself to help receiving a crib for the baby and to pick us at the airport,which she did for a very reasonable price.
"Overall the stay was great!\"",,,,,
2410846,22192806,2014-11-01,17840369,Jessica,"I actually stayed in a different apartment (had some issues switching the reservation on AirBnB) but the apartment I stayed at was also rented through Elyne. It was near Government Center and Faneuil Hall. The apartment was on the 2nd floor above an Irish bar. (See comments about noise below.) It was a lovely open-plan one bedroom (There was no bedroom door so technically it's a studio but the room is separate from the living space.) It was very nicely furnished, with a modern updated kitchen and bath. It was clean and spacious. I have already booked to return to this property. However, I will be upfront and say that if you are sensitive to noise, this is not the place for you. There are a row of Irish bar on the block and there is often live music, drunk people screaming until 2am on Thurs - Sat. The weekdays usually quiet down earlier. The bedroom isn't by the front windows so it is a little quieter in the bedroom but if you have people sleeping on the sofa or air mattress in the front room, it can be very loud. I did not mind the noise, I am used to it, but it is definitely something you should be aware of when booking the apartment. Again, this is not for the Beacon Hill one bedroom but another one of Boston Furnished Rentals one bedroom properties."
2410846,45250630,2015-09-01,29629360,Emily,"I rented this apartment for my visiting parents. The location is excellent, very central and walking distance to everything you could need in downtown Boston. It's safe and a good place to stay if you aren't planning to spend too much time hanging out there. The description is accurate, but we were disappointed with a few things. We were charged a $200 cleaning fee, but upon arrival, the apartment was not clean. It was dusty and not kept up very well. There was no toilet paper, paper towels, garbage bags, etc. So bring your own. One thing to keep in mind for summer guests: there is air conditioning but only a window unit in the living room. It is very hot in the bedroom. If you position the fan just so, it will blow the cool air down the hall, but still it is quite warm. Host Elyne was responsive enough, and provided us with an extra set of keys when asked."
2410846,67881763,2016-04-01,57419759,Lynn,"The stay in Boston was exactly as described, meaning a central location accessible to so many locations in Boston, all in walking distance.  The apartment was clean and the photos on line showed exactly what it looked like.   The location was safe and the Elynne was very helpful answering all questions we had along the way.  The apartment was equipped with everything that we needed with enough supplies to get us started for our stay.  Thank you so much."

Linda was a great host and spent a considerable amount of time helping me to figure it all out before arriving.    The location on Salem street was fantastic and within walking distance to everything, bars and restaurants all just steps outside door.  This area also was very safe.  The room is  cozy room with a large comfortable queen size bed.    This was a great experience and I was grateful for the opportunity to stay here and would not hesitate to do so again."
8555187,50381741,2015-10-11,17381318,Sushmita,"It was great meeting Linda (Fernande) and her room mate Ricardo. They are super nice and welcoming. The apartment is located in the busy north end of Boston with lots of touristy things to do within walking distance. Very nice places to eat as well. The street on which they live can get noisy on weekend nights (obnoxiously loud neighbors), I recommend bringing along ear plugs."
8555187,50606882,2015-10-12,46035906,Darrin,"My stay worked out exactly as I had hoped it to. Linda and her roommate were very welcoming and explained everything and answered all of my questions. I was looking for a simple place for the night and a good value for Boston's North End - which is hard to come by. The room is simple and very basic, but for me that was just fine. Most of my time there was spent exploring the beautiful old neighborhood. With a simple 2-3 minute walk you are in the middle of plenty of the North End's restaurants and shops. If you want to see Old Boston, it's a perfect place to be based. Personally, I would definitely be open to returning again."
8555187,55493075,2015-12-01,2812223,Salil,"Linda and Riccardo are just great. They made me feel at home. Ric even shared his nice dinner with me. The place is very centrally located in the North End of Boston. It is a few minutes walk from all the fun places and restaurants. The bed was comfortable and the area is quite quiet. This is not the fanciest apartment, but as a single person, it did the job for me and I made 2 new friends in the process. Definitely recommend it."
8555187,55870530,2015-12-06,6427261,Bryan,"Linda was an excellent host!  This was my first trip to Boston, and she made the accommodation part a breeze.  She was very responsive in communicating with me before I arrived and was very flexible with my arrival and departure times as well (which was a big plus for me).   The apartment location is central to everything like restaurants, bars, shopping, and all the historical sites.  The room was perfect for my needs as well, with a  nice comfortable, firm bed.   I'm a deep sleeper, so never really noticed much outside noise at night.   The bed was neatly made when  I arrived with  towel, soap, bottle of water, and subway map laid out.  I never used the subway b/c the city is so easy to walk  around.   The location is also very close to the airport which is nice as well.  I would definitely stay her again as the location was perfect and Linda was a superb host."
8555187,64393222,2016-03-03,9247845,Panagioti & Suzy,"Linda was a fabulous host. She met me at the stair and carried my bag up! Her place is centrally located - you couldn't get a more prime spot to spend the night in Boston. She is thoughtful, her place is clean and warm, and the Internet works like a charm. What more could I ask for?"
8555187,77867769,2016-06-04,16820694,Rich,This was my first AirBnB. Fernande and Ricardo were amazing hosts! Came in late due to flight delay and gave me some dinner! They gave me access so I could leave my bag so I could explore Boston!  The apartment is right in the middle of everything in the North End!  5 houses from old North Church and Mikes Pastry!  Great experience!
8555187,78542917,2016-06-07,36600484,Megan,My experience was great. Bed was comfy and the location was in the heart of the North End. So convenient!

We had some great conversation and she introduced to me to some her favorite restaurants in the area. The location was also fantastic - it's hard to beat staying in the North End if you want to visit Boston. Overall she helped make my visit very enjoyable. I would gladly stay with her again.
8555187,81476749,2016-06-23,73088685,Phillip,"Fernande was very friendly, hospitable and helpful. The location is fantastic and Fernande provided excellent local advice and tips. Highly recommend"

8555187,82040639,2016-06-26,30299425,Anke,"Fernande was a excellent host and she and her roommate made my stay very pleasant. The simple but comfortable room offered exactly what I needed for an overnight stay in Boston: a very comfortable bed, a clean bathroom and a cup of tea in the morning. And last but not least, it was located centrally in the North End, which really makes it a great place to explore Boston!"
8555187,83130716,2016-07-01,49640983,Justin,"Fernande is a wonderful host and her place is right in the center of Little Italy and the Freedom Trail. I know she will be moving to a new location in Boston soon, but if you get a chance to stay with her, she is a wonderful host and is very accommodating. I would recommend her to anyone!"

8555187,85599839,2016-07-12,15807470,Mary Ann,Fun area to stay next to all the action in the North End. Fernande is super nice and supplied water and some toiletries. Comfortable bed.

8555187,87514852,2016-07-20,56272841,Mirza Danish,The room as was described and the hospitality was even better. The host offered food on a daily basis and was extremely nice and made me feel very welcome. The location is very nice as the room was in the North End of the city. Lots of good stuff nearby and Fanuiel Hall is just a 10 minute walk down the street!
8555187,87903033,2016-07-22,80113753,Mikaela,"Fernande was an excellent host! Very nice, she gave me food and water when I got there. Offered any help she could and provided excellent tips for Boston. I would definitely stay here again!!"

8555187,90837740,2016-08-02,80734725,Jialin,"It's my first Airbnb trip and I travelled by myself without a car, so the safety and location are my top consideration for a place. North End is a great Italian neighborhood, it's safe even I came back at night. Bars, restaurants, stores are just blocks away."
Fernande is very easy going,relaxed and friendly. I couldn't ask for a better host than her. She came home to welcome me when I arrived on Friday noon and helped me with my luggage. She provided the guests breakfast,"coffee and other food in fridge. She also recommended me some reasonable priced restaurants to try in Boston. I would definitely come back to stay with her if I visit Boston again. \"",,,
8555187,93306973,2016-08-12,28515986,Caitlin,"Linda was a great host. She was friendly, helpful and welcoming. Her apartment is in a great location. Small but cozy!"
8555187,93479611,2016-08-13,68597326,Fiona,Fernande was very helpful when my plane arrived 4 hours late due to storms and she had to wake up to let me in to the appartment in the wee hours of the morning. Great location in the heart of old Boston and the freedom trail.
8555187,94385989,2016-08-15,82106663,Michelle,The location is great for exploring Boston by foot. There are really good restaurants nearby. Linda is a very warm and welcoming host. I felt immediately at home. I would come back any time
8555187,95597910,2016-08-20,64378346,Andrea,"Place was perfect for a couple nights. It's nothing special. Pretty small. Can't believe they pay that much for the place (I live in the Bay Area and also overpay for rent). It isn't in the best condition, but it didn't matter for me. Host went out of her way for me, even waking up at 3am to let me in when I arrived. Very friendly."
8555187,95830182,2016-08-21,8337691,Brandon,"Linda's place was great and Linda was very friendly and helpful.  The place was small and minimal, but in a great part of town and perfect for us, as we were just passing through for a night."
8555187,96406788,2016-08-22,28984407,Niek,It was a simple appartment as advertised. Linda and her roomate were awesome and very welcomming. I had a great time chatting with everyone there.
11455804,66219443,2016-03-20,29087785,Katerina,We really enjoyed staying at the studio. The location is nice and the place is modern and super clean.
11455804,70373186,2016-04-17,1613223,Melissa,"I stayed at the apartment with my husband for 1 night and was very pleased with everything.  Getting the key was easy as there is someone on site to help you.  I suggest requesting parking in advance as I had to make a few phone calls to add it on, but this was not a problem and they were very helpful when I called. The location was a 2 minute walk to the T and very easy to get to most destinations.  I would definitely stay here again!"
11455804,73263773,2016-05-07,61136380,MayDene,The listing description was very accurate.  This new property is close to the metro station and downtown Boston.  The rental and building facilities are clean and include all the modern amenities.  Great value for the location.
11455804,74167439,2016-05-13,20238471,Justin,Great spot.  Very convenient.  Can't wait to stay there again. Top of the line
5702292,52724929,2015-11-01,45597105,Paul,I had a great stay here and Kaitlin was very accommodating. The room was room was the essence of Jamaica Plain. I definitely recommend it
5702292,70351661,2016-04-17,66479039,Jeff,It was fine.
5702292,70573328,2016-04-18,24966152,Deanna,"This was a super last minute booking on my part as travel plans changed the day before I was heading to Boston for the marathon. The room is spacious with a little seating area nook on the side. Even though it is on the first floor and facing the street, the neighborhood was quiet the Sunday night I stayed. Even though the hostess lives on sight, I had privacy, but she was also available as I needed her. She was easy to communicate with and answered all my text message questions quickly!"
Having easy access to the washer and dryer was a fantastic bonus :) The kitchen was stocked with basic cooking essentials so it was convenient for me to prepare dinner and breakfast for myself.,,,,,
The location was great. Whole Foods is a lovely 20 minute stroll through a cute neighborhood. The T is less than a 10 minute walk away,and only 20 minute train ride away from the convention center and many great sightseeing spots.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
5702292,76269855,2016-05-26,59009452,Braden,"I had a good stay. I stayed for just over a month and had a good time getting to know the other housemates. My room was big, had a king sized bed, with lots of drawer space. The washer dryer worked great and it was really convenient to be able to wash clothes whenever. The bathroom is nothing special but the shower and hot water work great. The wifi here is insanely fast and I really appreciated that. The house is so close to the orange line, making it really easy to get downtown quickly."
"Kaitlin cares about her guests and was always checking to make sure that I had everything I needed to be comfortable. I would definitely recommend someone to stay here. \"",,,,,
5702292,77641888,2016-06-02,61117087,Gwen,I felt welcomed as the host sent me a text in the days leading up to touch base and inform me of how to find and get into my room. The neighborhood is quiet and it's just a short walk to the train station.
5702292,80499094,2016-06-18,76868111,Leaf,"I had a great time in Kaitlin's place in JP.  Ike and Luis were very nice and answered all my questions.  The space is great: an open kitchen and plenty of room.  I also really appreciated having easy access to the washing machine and dryer.  While I was in JP, I enjoyed playing basketball in courts nearby and biking along the greenway."
5702292,82298017,2016-06-27,60086386,Alexander,I had to arrive late on a Friday.  My bus was delayed coming in and Kaitlin was communicative over text to make sure that I was able to enter the building when I had finally arrived.
The room is right across from a bathroom and next to the kitchen,inside the kitchen is the washer and dryer.  Bathroom supplies were above the w+d units.,,,,
I didn't spent a lot of time when I wasn't sleeping in the unit but I never saw the other people living there and only heard them on my last morning.,,,,,
"Location is pretty close to the Green St stop and there's a number of restaurants and stores within walking distance.\"",,,,,
5702292,84649208,2016-07-08,17242180,Xiana,"Except from the fact that she didn´t reply to my messages before my arrival and that was very troublesome for me...once I got to the place Kaitlin was a very good hostess, communication was great and she was very accesible and helpful. The room is very big, wifi goes very well, the neighbourhood is very safe and great location and the atmosphere of the house is very nice...I really liked the roomates!"
5702292,86536071,2016-07-16,10040513,Aoibheann,I had a great stay! Kaitlin is a SUPER host - really friendly and very quick to reply to emails or messages! I recommend this place highly -the bed room is very spacious and having a private seating area and coffee table off the bedroom was a real bonus.
"Id just remind future guest to bring their key with them when leaving the room - even if just going to toilet - the door locked behind me and I had to wake poor Kaitlin very early to save me! She was a total star about it tho even tho I was entirely to blame! Thanks Kaitlin!\"",,,,,
5702292,91240571,2016-08-04,85393483,Elizabeth,"\"The location is great for traveling to/from Boston.  The house is on a quiet street in a residential neighborhood and within walking distance of both the Green Street and Stony Brook stops on the orange line of the T.   Parking on the street is available and safe.  There are cute little cafes and restaurants to enjoy in the neighborhood as well.  Kaitlin is a great hostess with a sweet personality. She was responsive when communicating prior to arrival and available throughout the stay. The room was modest but clean and in a great location on the first floor with the bathroom and kitchen nearby.  The washer and dryer (and laundry detergent) were a plus.  There is a refrigerator and pantry to store your groceries and everyone in the house was respectful to only consume their own things.  Overall it was a good experience and I would stay here again if needed.  If you are looking for a decent place to stay close to Boston in a safe neighborhood with a great hostess then book this \"\"elegant space in JP\"\" :-)\""
5702292,93566761,2016-08-13,67253517,M.,She was very nice and welcoming.

She was there to welcome us despite a later than planned arrival, had clean sheets and towels ready for us, and told us about the neighborhood. The room was good, with a huge bed and plenty of floor space. It was great having the kitchen and bathroom right outside our room's door. We'd stay here again!"
5702292,96423900,2016-08-22,15998273,Hanley,My stay at this Airbnb was super comfortable. Everything was clean and Kaitlin made sure I had everything I could need. The kitchen and laundry access made my stay really make me feel at home. I'd recommend this for anyone wanting to stay in Boston for a few nights.
2219399,12782039,2014-05-11,5827893,Tatiana,"The place was exactly as described, surprisingly quiet in a very nice neighborhood with lots of green spaces. It is very close to the orange line stop, which is very handy for traveling to the city. The buses are also there, no 39 takes you directly to the museum of fine art."
There is a supermarket 3 minutes walk from the house. A ten minute walk takes your to the more shops,cafe and another supermarket.,,,,
The room was very cozy,with lots of light,the bed soft and comfortable. The house is very bright and clean,very quiet at night. Loved the tulips in the bathroom,they really makes the place special! Wifi worked perfectly,which is often the issue at the hotels.
Andrew was such a friendly and generous host! He helped me with the information about the area and Boston and even provided a travel guidebook for the city to use. He also let me stay later after the checkout time,"which is very much appreciated. \"",,,,
2219399,13079715,2014-05-19,13791319,Tom,Our stay at Andrew’s was very enjoyable.  The comfortable queen size bed and private bathroom were definitely a plus.  The wifi was reliable.  The breakfast provided a great selection of fruit to mix with the yogurt.  At one point we brought back leftover pizza from a restaurant and had a toaster oven to reheat it with later.
For us,being so close to the T was great.  We did not have nor need a car.  From the airport we took a shuttle to the train.  On the train it was the Blue line to the end of the Orange line to just a short walking distance to the house.   Being at the end of the line meant that we always got an empty seat when we left the house.  That terminal is also at the start of the 39 buss,which goes through the heart of Jamaica Plane,which is full of fantastic restaurants.  The 39 also took us just across the street from the MFA.  We both got 7 day link passes for $18 dollars each.  This gave us unlimited access to the trains and busses our entire stay.,,
However,we did enjoy walking to many areas.  Just south is a short walk to Harvest Market.  To the west is Arnold Arboretum.  It provides a large area to walk either paved roads without traffic or walking paths.   And of course there were many areas around Boston we walked through.,,,,
Andrew was the perfect host.  He provided directions,maps and recommendations whenever we needed.   Yet,"he still gave us time to ourselves.  He is very easy to get along with.\"",,,
2219399,13783604,2014-06-04,10875903,Kali,"This is a great location. The bed is comfortable. The bathroom is down the stairs from the bedroom, but it was not a problem.  Andrew is lovely and his home is a wonderful, comfortable space filled with beautiful art.  He wasn't home for most of our stay, and when he was there, he was friendly, but did not intrude on our space. All in all, a very good experience and we would stay again."
"\"",,,,,
2219399,13995660,2014-06-09,16275115,Angie,"My husband and I were looking for a comfortable, private accommodation to use as our base during a family weekend in Jamaica Plain. Andrew's house was everything we could have wanted and more. It's a beautifully decorated and inviting space with an upstairs bedroom and downstairs guest bathroom. Andrew wasn't home while we were there, but he was a wonderful host. We arrived late in the evening, and he was kind enough to leave the coffee pot set for the next morning. The backyard garden was a perfect spot for our morning coffee, and the best way to start our day. While we had a busy weekend planned, we truly enjoyed our downtime in this relaxing retreat. The house is located a stone's throw from a T stop, and very close to grocery stores, restaurants, hike/bike trails, and other attractions. We enjoyed our stay, and would love to visit again."
2219399,16591935,2014-07-29,16330577,Eric,"We were met at the T stop and very graciously welcomed to Andrew's home. Easy and comfortable stay. Felt much like we were visiting a friend, and it really is a sunny place. Would be an easy place to stay for anyone travelling on Amtrak, getting off at Back Bay and taking the Orange line to Forest Hills. No need for a car in Boston. The T will take you just about anywhere, or use Uber."
"This is the first time we've tried airbnb and it was successful.\"",,,,,
2219399,17069526,2014-08-06,18681585,Olin,"Andrew was a fantastic host, gracious, helpful, and went above and beyond to make our stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible.  He would set the coffee pot ready to go, and provide a variety of mixed fruits and yogurt for breakfast.  He was extremely helpful in suggesting places to visit and what routes to take."
For the visiting tourist,you couldn't ask for a better location in the Boston area.  The house is a short walk to the train station,which can get you nearly anywhere you need to go in Boston.  In addition,there are multiple good restaurants in walking distance,and the neighborhood is a stone's throw from the Arnold Arboretum.,
The backyard garden was a great spot to sit,sip coffee,rest,and (if you are so inclined) take advantage of the provided wifi.  The bedroom was very comfortable for the two of us who were staying,and included its own AC unit,if you desired a different temperature from the rest of the house.
We highly recommend Andrew's place for your visit to Boston. You won't find a better host or location.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2219399,19238772,2014-09-08,8583276,Hinda,"Andrew was an excellent host. He provided accurate, easily understandable information about how to reach his home.  He let us know when he would be available and greeted us warmly  when we arrived. Andrew's home is lovely and is very accurately represented in the promotional material.  The environment is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable. He provided all we needed and made us feel very much at home.  As music lovers, we felt very privileged to be in the home of an accomplished composer.  Although we realize his schedule is very busy, we enjoyed that he was available for some friendly, interesting conversation. The bedroom and private bath were just what we needed and we were physically and otherwise very comfortable."
The neighborhood could not be better.  The T station was directly across the street,but far enough for us not to hear the noise of the station. One can be in other parts of Boston within minutes.There are buses and taxi's within steps.  The nearby homes are charming; most seem to be inhabited by attentive gardeners (Andrew included) as evidenced by the many flowers.  If one wants to see lovely vegetation and would like to have a pleasant stroll,the Harvard Arnold Arboretum is literally around the corner from Andrew's home.,,,
All in all,our stay could not have been better. We recommend this airbnb highly.,,,,

The best part of our four night visit to Boston was our stay with Andrew!  His home is cozy,comfortable,and convenient for touring Boston (just steps to the T).,,,
Andrew made us feel very welcome and at home!  Before we arrived he contacted me go get an idea of our itinerary and asked what we liked for breakfast.  We didn't want to be any trouble,and generally eat a light breakfast,which Andrew accommodated,but after several days,he encouraged us to let him bring in some pastries and muffins from local bakery,and boy was that a treat!
The comfortable bedroom was separated from the bathroom by a flight of stairs,which wasn't problem at all!  We had everything we needed and we also felt private.,,,,
Andrew was very interesting to talk to - a perfect host!  On our first night,he opened a bottle of wine and we had fun getting acquainted.  He always politely probed to be sure we wanted to chat,which we did.  Andrew was gone Sat morning through Sun Evening and we had the place to ourselves!,,,
Andrew very kindly helped us refine our itinerary and wrote down the best routes to take,and let us know about interesting things to see along our route.  Although a long time resident,he's still excited about the beauty and culture of Boston! He says he's not a tour guide,but all of his suggestions,including dining recommendations,perfectly matched our interests and tastes!  He lent us maps
Another bonus is Andrew's beautiful garden which spills over into the house with cheery fresh flowers,"even in the bathroom!\"",,,,
2219399,20770326,2014-10-05,20802783,George And Marca,"Andrew is a perfect host and a lovely person with a beautiful house. Prior to arriving he had asked us for our breakfast wishes, these were standing ready when we arrived. The room is lovely and the bed was very comfortable. The house is opposite the T station from where its a 15 minute journey to the centre of town, can't beat that for convenience. All and all our 3 days at Andrews place was great. We can highly recommend him."
"\"",,,,,
2219399,22930530,2014-11-17,14295215,Tiffany Frances,Andrew was a great host! My boyfriend and I loved staying at this beautiful and comfortable home for 2 nights over a weekend.
Andrew made sure to ask what we wanted for breakfast and set it up for us each morning,which was so sweet. He also wasn't home the first night of our stay,so we had the place to ourselves. It was nice having our own bathroom as well. It was also nice to chat with him when we did see him. The location is great and ideal - right across the end of the orange T line,and a short walk to Jamaica Plain's amenities,including a great cafe,grocery stores
2219399,29887233,2015-04-13,2585325,Cynthia,"Staying at Andrew's place was a fabulous experience. It's right next to the Forest Hills T station, and was a great base for traveling all over the city, while also within walking distance of all the JP attractions. The house was lovely and comfortable - especially the bed - and with breakfast and a separate bathroom, was a great deal compared with other rooms offered in the same area. Andrew was such a helpful and generous host. I'd stay there again any time and would recommend it to anybody."
2219399,30215056,2015-04-19,1554350,Sarah,Andrew sent us a message before our arrival asking us about our breakfast preferences which was a nice touch. The apartment was nice and clean. Andrew is a musician (or composer) as you can tell by the nice decor and books in his study. We had a nice time visiting in Boston. A big plus is that a major train station was so accessible for us to travel. There was parking available for those driving into town.
2219399,30377301,2015-04-21,16185814,Carol,Andrew was a great host - very friendly and helpful.   His home is lovely and very convenient to transportation and shops and restaurants.  Also a beautiful arboretum nearby.  We'd stay there again.
2219399,34475904,2015-06-08,33844335,James,"My hosts made me feel very welcome.  Comfy bed helped me get three good nights sleep.  Convenient location for getting to my son's in JP.  I was worried about the bathroom being downstairs from the bedroom, but it worked out  fine.  I'd stay here agan."
2219399,37467863,2015-07-07,33074893,Kevin J.,"Andrew, thank you for making our stay comfortable and pleasurable even in your absence. Damasio was a great host and went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and to see that all our needs were met! You have a beautiful home, which was very cozy and welcoming."
2219399,38126857,2015-07-13,12964259,Megan,"We felt very welcome and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  The home was just as pictured.  The bedroom was upstairs from the bath and was very comfortable and air-conditioned.  It contains a desk where you can work if need be but the whole home is peaceful and colorful.  Andrew was traveling during our stay but his friend Damasio did a great job acting as our host.  He had a wonderful selection of coffee, teas, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal and granola available for us.  There were many nice little touches like the vase of fresh flowers in the private bathroom.  Andrew was nice enough to leave a reusable charlie card for us (this makes your T fares lower) and also his MFA member card for our use.  The house is beautiful and the garden in the back yard is amazing.  Arnold's Arboretum is only a short walk away which is a great plus and gives you a respite from the city.  The location is much quieter than staying in Boston but is only a short, quick (15 min) commute to downtown on the Orange line with the Forest Hills station right across the street.  Also, Andrew gave us recommendations for restaurants in Jamaica Plain which were within walking distance and the food was as good or better than most we have eaten in the city."
2219399,42053500,2015-08-10,1840728,Deborah,"Andrew communicated well with me before my stay, asked about my preferences and left a clear and helpful note for my arrival since he could not be there.  He left several vases of fresh flowers, a place setting for breakfast and everything I would need to feel welcome in his home.  The photos are accurate but don't really do justice to the sense of tranquility and comfort this tastefully decorated home conveys, complete with gardens that just made me smile inside and out.  I only had a brief time to visit with Andrew since he was away much of the time I was there (and I had to leave early) but when we finally met briefly, I found him to be gracious, friendly and helpful.   I didn't mind having to go up and down stairs to the bathroom as it was only a short distance.  The bed was comfy and the location convenient to JP and transportation.  I would not hesitate to stay there again."
2219399,43686101,2015-08-21,40553159,Robert A.,My stay here was perfect. The host was very accommodating and friendly.The location suited my needs very well while I was in Boston. Would recommend this host to a friend or family member without hesitation.
2219399,44572939,2015-08-27,40621601,Charles,Everything about my stay in Boston was fantastic. Andrew was a great host. The coffee/breakfast setup was ideal. His house location makes it a breeze to get around (I barely used my car). The bed and bath were very comfortable and gave a nice feeling of privacy.
Perhaps the most stunning thing is his garden surrounding the entire house. There's the most beautiful terraced setup in the back that is full of food and flowers. I'd recommend having your morning coffee on the table back there. Heaven!,,,,,
"Next time I'm in Boston I'll be (hopefully) staying with Andrew again!\"",,,,,
2219399,44798576,2015-08-29,11803245,Ellen,"Andrew is an incredibly gracious host!  It was so nice of him to check with us about our breakfast needs/wants before we arrived, and from the moment we met him he was very friendly and concerned about our comfort in his home, which is lovely.  He responded immediately our first morning when we told him that a lot of light came into our room quite early by figuring out how to arrange the curtain so it covered the upper part of the window while leaving the air conditioner in the lower part of the window unencumbered.  Our room and bathroom were comfortable and private.  We would certainly stay with Andrew again if the need arises."
2219399,45980011,2015-09-07,38038110,Tommy,"Andrew was out of town, but his caretaker Damasio was friendly and helpful.  Beautiful home, well appointed, right next to a T stop, off street parking, we were very happy."
2219399,46524768,2015-09-11,122121,Nhiem,"I stayed at Andrew's place for 4 nights while in Boston. Andrew was very accommodating and helpful. He offered me breakfast, tea, coffee... which were great. Andrew's place was quite convenient as it was close to the station. A few stops and you got to Back Bay, Downtown, Chinatown... The room was clean and comfortable."
I recommend the host and the room !,,,,,
"Thanks Andrew.\"",,,,,
2219399,47492833,2015-09-19,15214657,Linda,"This is a lovely property, excellent location to use public transportation, which is what I want to use in Boston!  Great breakfast,  very helpful local resource information.  Then there is this beautiful garden to enjoy with your morning coffee.  We liked it so much we are going back."
2219399,48406963,2015-09-26,9219054,Tony,"It's wonderful to stay in Andrew's house,the house is the same as the picture.Andrew is a friendly ,helpful host.Everything is perfect!"
2219399,48819728,2015-09-28,43987959,Lisa,"The stay at Andrew's place was very pleasant experience.  He gave me good suggestion to take taxi in stead of metro as I arrive at midnight at the airport.  The room was fully prepared for receiving me and Andrew keeps the place very clean and tidy.  He prepared metro card for guests so all I need to do is top up the card. I have my own bath room, not sharing with anyone else which is good and private. Andrew is very friendly and I met him on the second night and had pleasant talks with him. For people who does not drive, the location is also a plus as the place is right on the opposite side of the orange line station (the metro) so that one can easily get to the major sightseeing sites by a short ride."
2219399,49025984,2015-09-30,15214657,Linda,"This was our second stay w/ Andrew and we would happily return next time we come this way.  The accommodations are artistic, the location ideal, close to good restaurants, public transportation and a short walk to the Arnold Arboretum.  Good morning coffee and conversation with a creative host."
2219399,49507903,2015-10-04,44152191,Anne-Laure,Nous avons été très bien accueillis et la maison est magnifique. Par malchance il y a eu des travaux pendant la nuit et nous avons écourté notre séjour. Andrew n'avait pas été informé de ces travaux et nous a très gentiment remboursé les nuits déjà payées. Nous recommandons cet endroit!
2219399,50104684,2015-10-09,43201131,Albina,"Andrew очень гостеприимный и душевный хозяин! Порекомендовал места, которые стоит посмотреть, готовил вкусный кофе по утрам. Не смотря на мой плохой английский удалось пообщаться и обменяться впечатлениями от города. Комната очень уютная, чистая. Ванная чистая и светлая. Остались только приятные воспоминания о поездке!"
2219399,50499521,2015-10-12,30074080,Rubina,"Andrew and Damasio had a lovely home and were great hosts. Andrew welcomed us to his home and was kind enough to suggest places to see and visit. Even though we didn't have time to go, Andrew let us borrow his Museum of Fine Arts membership card to get discounted tickets. He also had plenty of brochures and guides to look through for sightseeing ideas."
We had a good trip and it was made even better by our stay in the home. We not only had access to our own clean bathroom but also complimentary breakfast of toast,cereals,yogurt,fruits,and teas/coffee every morning.,
"Thanks Andrew and Damasio!\"",,,,,
2219399,51065780,2015-10-17,6187223,Melissa,"My sister and I visited Boston for the first time and Andrew's home was so warm and welcoming! His house is clean, charming and conveniently located across the street from the subway station. The guest room had a comfy bed and the private bath was a nice plus! Andrew was very helpful with recommendations on where to eat and even offered us his membership card to receive $50 off our entry to the Museum of Fine Arts. Andrew provided a light breakfast each morning. We opted for the hand crafted yogurt, made by his friend, Domisco and fresh, delicious apples hand picked from the trees! I recommend Andrew's home to anyone who would like to be slightly tucked away from the bustling of downtown Boston, but still close enough to hop the train and explore all parts of this vibrant city! Thank you, Andrew and Domisco!"
2219399,52827163,2015-11-02,36365795,Ashleigh,"Andrew was a wonderful host! His beautiful home was our first ever Airbnb experience and it was awesome! Andrew is a kind, warm, and helpful human being who made our trip to Boston even more memorable. Thank you again so much for your hospitality, Andrew! We would love to come back when we visit Boston again :)"
2219399,56601924,2015-12-15,15156064,Ann,"Andrew was very welcoming and had fruit and other breakfast items ready for us. The apartment is charming and very well located near a T station and a grocery store. The room is up a narrow set of stairs, but these proved not to be a problem. Andrew helped us with driving directions, above and beyond the duty of a host! We look forward to staying there again."
2219399,68473865,2016-04-05,21024522,Ilze,"The listing description was totally accurate and Andrew made me feel so welcome by explaining to me how to get around Boston - which trains /buses to take, etc."
2219399,70891970,2016-04-21,47419673,Birgit,"Accommodation by Andrew is very closed to the T station. Andrew gave us important information and showed us quickly where we can get tge card. Also, he gave us good tips on the city and some restaurants. In a few weeks the flowers will bloom beautifully in front of the house. The american coffee for breakfast was super."
2219399,75348056,2016-05-20,67126768,Feng,"beautiful house,garden,flowers. Andrew makes everything carefully  in his house, he loves live very much.He gave me a very clean bedroom,private bathroom,Andrew supplies everything I need.subway station is nearby the house, it's very convenient,you can go everywhere by train or bus. I 'll recommend this house to all my friends who comes to Boston."
2219399,75955902,2016-05-23,22478818,Laila,"Andrew is a fantastic host. He was very helpful and generous. He put out breakfast and made coffee every morning. and although we stayed for only a very hectic weekend and weren't home a lot, we really enjoyed the time we spent there so much. The house is lovely and the room is really nice, clean and private, the bed is also extremely comfortable - exactly what we needed after a busy day walking the city.  The place is literally across the street from the T station as described which is extremely convenient and was perfect for our trip."
2219399,77040860,2016-05-30,5777994,Whitney,"We didn't meet Andrew in person as he was traveling when we stayed at his house, but he was very good at communicating prior to our stay and his house-mate Damasio was a wonderful host. The house is literally across the street from a T station, so even though it's not located right downtown it's extremely easy to get wherever, and it's much easier to park and probably significantly more quiet than being right downtown. The house is also within walking distance of the Harvard Arboretum, which is wonderful and totally worth a visit. Andrew had left maps and a Boston visitor's book for us - both of which where very helpful, and they had simple breakfast food available in the morning. This was a great location for our quick visit to Boston!"
2219399,78479966,2016-06-07,9670006,Meghan,"\"I felt compelled to leave after two nights of a five night reservation.  The listing is NOT accurate.  The bed is a FULL not a queen and it CREAKS horribly.  The tiny attic bedroom is separated by a very long, narrow, steep set of stairs with very narrow treads from the bath which is directly off the kitchen.  I hardly slept at all the first night in this situation.  The second night, my husband went to a hotel and I stayed as I wanted to be near my daughter in JP whom I was there to visit.  This second night I slept in a state of utter exhaustion until 11 am the next morning.  The host made sarcastic comments about the late hour and urged me to eat outdoors, clearly indicating he did not want me in the kitchen.  Embarrassing.  Then he started calling me \"\"Maureen\"\" even though we had communicated plenty in previous days with my name"
2219399,79689876,2016-06-13,67483035,Jan,"Lovely home located very close to the T, making getting around Boston super easy. Andrew was away on business for most of our stay but we met him before we left. A nice guy who really knows how to garden - the back yard is beautiful! Our substitute host, Damasio, was wonderful. We came home one evening to a freshly baked chocolate cake - such a nice treat. The bedroom is upstairs and the bath is on the main floor, but both are clean and private. This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was very positive. We visit Boston frequently and will definitely stay here again."
2219399,80623616,2016-06-19,75201074,Ray,"We were greeted by Andrew at the appointed meeting time, and were immediately made welcomed.  Bedroom was well appointed, neat and clean; and the bed was comfortable.  Bedroom was on its own floor, so there were no privacy issues.  Location is about two hundred yards from the terminus of the MBTA's Orange Line, so it's quite convenient to wherever you'd like to go in the metropolitan area.  Only inconvenience is that the (private) bathroom is one floor below the bedroom.  Would definitely return."
2219399,81830718,2016-06-25,39830886,Thomas,Our stay at Andrew's house was great!  He was very friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay.  The listing was accurate.
2219399,83686373,2016-07-03,6662051,Jean-Pierre,"Notre échange de courriel, les quelques jours avant notre arrivée, ont permis de vraiment nous sentir les bienvenus."
Le lien de confiance qui se tisse entre nous et notre hôte me ravit à chaque fois que j'utilise les services de Airbnb.,,,,,
La maison est aménagée avec goût. Le métro est à deux pas.,,,,,

2219399,85651390,2016-07-12,6689710,Eric,"\"Andrew's Sunny Private Room and Bathroom worked perfectly during our visit with our son in Boston. We needed a place with off street parking and convenient to the T. That way we could \"\"ditch\"\" the car and be able to easily get around.  Andrew's location provided just that.  The Orange Line and 39 bus at the Forest Hills station enabled us to easily get to places in JP"
The room and bathroom were immaculate,well appointed and extremely comfortable and private as advertised.  The configuration of the house lends itself well to providing privacy for Airbnb guests.,,,,
The fresh fruit and fresh baked muffins for breakfast were delicious.  The table settings for breakfast were beautiful as well.,,,,,
Damasio,in Andrew's absence,was a marvelous host who made us feel very welcome.,,,
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will stay here on future visits.\"",,,,,
2219399,87258528,2016-07-19,24118606,Jeff & Teri,"Andrew's friend, Damasio,  was our host and made us feel welcomed and valued.  (Andrew was out of town.)  The room was comfortable and cool on these hot summer nights.  As others have reported, the location is across the street from the train station, so access to Boston was easy.   The bedroom is upstairs and the private bathroom downstairs.   Unusual, but no problem at all.  We had a very nice time here and recommend it highly."
2219399,88122605,2016-07-23,84880004,Anna,"We had such an amazing time in Boston. Andrew is a wonderful host and staying at his place was perfect! Easy to get in to town, lovely house and super friendly and helpful owner. Thx again Andrew! We will for sure stay with you again when we one to Boston."
2219399,92789896,2016-08-10,35134755,Daniel,Der Aufenthalt hat mir sehr gut gefallen und der Empfang war wunderbar herzlich.

"Vielen Dank.\"",,,,,
2219399,94211190,2016-08-15,2350936,Hieu,"Andrew and Damasio did a great job of hosting myself and my husband! They did a great job of contacting us early on and the communication was easy. The bedroom and bathroom arrangements do lend themselves to privacy, and the bed is quite comfortable. They also maintain a beautiful and enviable backyard garden. We will definitely stay here again in future visits to Boston!"
2219399,97763558,2016-08-28,86077600,Charletta,"Our host did everything to make us feel so welcome. .down to the perfect sunflower greeting us in the bathroom in the morning.  At our breakfast table were all these brochures to assist us in our plans for the weekend.  The location is ideal..across the street from the orange line which took us directly to our whale watch and the next day to the freedom trail.  We loved sitting in the garden visiting with our host each morning as we ate breakfast.  When we come back to Boston this will be our stay!  The bed was comfortable, not a noisy place so it was easy to sleep, and it was spotless! Can't possibly say enough positive about this location.  Awesome host!"
2219399,99674862,2016-09-05,92537200,Shumei,Very clean and airy. The place looks nicer than the pictures.
1692573,8340431,2013-10-26,9530352,Ken,"Had a very positive  three night stay at the 'urban oasis'. Both Kelly and Phil were gracious hosts, the third floor where we stayed was clean and accurate to the description. For myself and two sons of 15 the short bus or tram ride to the center of Boston was easy. Also the small Main Street of Jamaica Plain was close by and made for easily accessible shops and restaurants."
1692573,11729392,2014-04-13,789551,Maria,"Kelly and Phil's place is a really lovely flat on the top floor of a beautiful old house in Jamaica Plain.  I stayed here for work in Longwood Medical Area, which is very convenient (a stop on the orange line T is about a 5 minute walk away or the 39 bus in the other direction); anything downtown or even Cambridge should also be pretty convenient if you are comfortable on the T.  Kelly and Phil were extremely kind hosts, with wonderful coffee and morning snacks.  The flat shares a stairway with the main house, but the upstairs is very private with a door.  Jamaica Plain is a great neighborhood and fun to explore if you have some time to spend."
1692573,11820435,2014-04-15,1851246,Amy,"Kelly and Phil were wonderful hosts. We didn't need much assistance, but if you do they are happy to provide suggestions. The house is beautiful and just as pictured.  You have the entire third floor to yourself.  We were very comfortable especially when the day turned rainy and we stayed in just hanging out for a few hours - there are lots of games and a simple kitchenette.  The location is great...  Walking distance to tons of restaurants, shopping and the Arnold Arboretum.  Hub bike rentals are also very close by (and lots of fun!)  I highly recommend their home and would definitely stay here again!"
1692573,12352223,2014-04-29,6120296,Silviana,"We had a nice stay at Kelly and Phil’s place. The apartment is at the top floor of the house, it’s very clean and tidy and accurate to the description. The location is very good, close to public transportation, markets and plenty of nice restaurants. The hosts were very friendly, generous and helpful. We would definitely recommend Urban Oasis suite."
1692573,12441250,2014-05-02,8461461,Leeanne,"Kelly and Phil were great hosts! Super friendly and great communicators, made me feel right at home! This apartment was a little more intimately connected to the rest of the house than I thought, but it was no problem because the hosts were really really great and made me feel very comfortable. Thanks for the great stay!"
1692573,12515574,2014-05-04,14509566,Pierre-Olivier,"Kelly and Phil are very friendly and nice people. They were great hosts, they made us  feel right at home (Phil offered me to watch the first game Montreal VS Boston for the 1st game of Play-off :) GO HABS GO ;) ) Even if the area is connected with the house, we had our own area with everything for feeling at home. Thank you!"
1692573,12954665,2014-05-15,13639016,Leandro,"Staying at the Phill's home was extremely good for me and my two guests. The house had everything we need and everything very clean. The area is well located with easy access to restaurants, subways and buses lines."
1692573,13668580,2014-06-02,14016459,Linda,"Our family of three (senior couple and adult daughter) found this rental to be ideal for our vacation in Boston.  Jamaica Plain is a great neighborhood, with groceries, shopping, and restaurants a short walk away. It only took us 5 minutes to walk to the Orange line, which took us just about everywhere we wanted to go."
The neighborhood was quiet,yards beautifully landscaped,and we were able to fix simple meals with the microwave and frig. Air conditioners in each bedroom allowed for sleeping comfort.  Internet worked very well. The price was very reasonable for a 2 bedroom apartment.  The only drawback might be the three flights of stairs. Not a problem for us,but not a good choice for someone with mobility issues.,,
Our hosts were helpful when we needed assistance,but as we had relatives nearby,"we had few questions.\"",,,
1692573,13880095,2014-06-07,7085144,Ted,"We enjoyed an amazing stay with Kelly and Phil. They were gracious hosts who provided yoghurt and fresh fruit for us to enjoy in the spacious, spotless and tastefully decorated third floor apartment that consists of two large bedrooms, a full bath, and a kitchenette. Their place would be perfect for families traveling with kids, and it was perfect for my wife and I and our 22-yr-old daughter. The apartment is in the heart of Jamaica Plain and you can easily walk to the T and dozens of restaurants."
1692573,13957512,2014-06-09,5475026,Audra,"Kelly and Phil were great hosts.  They were friendly and accommodating and very easy to get in contact with.  They made our stay relaxing and enjoyable.  Their home is beautiful and the third floor space was perfect for our family of 3.  Everything was extremely clean and well maintained; better than some hotels even.  And the little extras, like yogurt and milk in the fridge and a fun kid-themed towel for our daughter, were very thoughtful touches.  The neighborhood is gorgeous and just a short walk from the house are restaurants, shops and parks.  We would definitely stay here again.  Thanks, Kelly and Phil!"
1692573,14406784,2014-06-18,3165755,Lizzie,"I stayed at Urban Oasis for two nights with my husband and our two kids.  We had a wonderful, relaxing stay.  The apartment is just as described, very comfortable.  The children loved playing the board games while I lay around!"
The neighborhood is great.  We tried out a couple of restaurants and a cafe,"and spent a large part of an afternoon exploring around the pond with the kids.   Kelly and Phil were charming and easy to work with.  Highly recommended.\"",,,,
1692573,14470061,2014-06-20,3718160,Gail,"Wonderful location, beautiful rooms, very comfortable beds with lovely linens. You have the whole 3rd floor to yourself with two bedrooms, bathroom and little kitchen area with fridge, sink, table & benches, plates, bowls, cutlery, glasses.  The fridge has fresh milk and coffee makings are provided."
The house is a 3-minute walk to Center Street,"the  \"\"Main Street\"\" of Jamaica Plain",with many restaurants,JP Licks ice cream/frozen yogurt,loads of little shops,CVS Pharmacy
1692573,14958839,2014-06-30,11933399,Laurie,"My stay with Kelly and Phil's exceeded my expectations. I rented their place for  a couple days because of it's location near my sister's wedding venue. And wow was I blessed.  Many guests went the air bnb route but experienced troubles whereas I experienced bliss. The apartment was close to downtown and the venue as I expected so I was able to walk everywhere.  Most important, the acommendations exceeded my expectations.  I was greeted the first day and was given a key. The master bedroom was super clean, stylish, comfortable and honestly larger than I expected with a closet for hanging my dress. (and an iron to boot!) Since the apartment was on the floor, I felt like I had my own space. The added offerings of fresh coffee and creamer in  the kitchen refrigerator was much appreciated.  I would highly recommend the host and their  apartment. I felt like I was staying at home which is great way to feel when travelling."
1692573,15393640,2014-07-08,5472007,Michael,"This made a great start to our stay in the US. A beautiful house in a pleasant, interesting neighbourhood, very handy for the subway. Perfect for our family of four, and good value compared to staying in a hotel. And though we met our hosts only briefly, they were charming. Thanks!"
1692573,15554926,2014-07-11,17526308,Kelly,Everything was beyond wonderful at Kelly and Phil's.  Very comfortable bed.  Lovely quiet street.  Really fun art everywhere in the house. I can not recommend this place enough.  The location (proximity to all things fun) as others have mentioned is just the best.  A friendly and comfortable home with thoughtful touches throughout.
1692573,15689902,2014-07-14,16259687,Lenhart,All very enjoyable
1692573,15862709,2014-07-17,13698457,Susan,"Very welcoming hosts and a lovely Victorian house.The apartment had two large bedrooms, one twin and one double and we enjoyed the art work."
The kitchen area has a micro-wave oven,'fridge and washing-up sink,and a table and seating but we ate out.,,,
The bathroom is quirky but the shower was powerful and the Boston water is soft.,,,,,
It is 15 minutes from downtown Boston by metro and about 40 minutes by bus.Both metro and bus are within 10 minutes walk of the house. Phil accompanied us to the subway on our 1st morning and the family made us feel very comfortable.,,,,,
We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again very happily and would recommend it.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1692573,16201290,2014-07-23,5488127,Pat,The suite was just as pictured and described. We had a few questions prior to arriving and Kelly and Phil answered them promptly. The property is in a pleasant neighborhood of large older homes. You can walk to pretty much anything you need and the T stop is nearby for access to all Boston has to offer.
It was not awkward to be staying in someone's home and sharing their front door. The owners were very cordial the one time we met; otherwise our respective comings and goings were different. It was clear they would be available and helpful had there been a need.,,,,,
The suite was very clean. We enjoyed the tasteful and whimsical decor. Comfy beds; good bedding and towels. 4-year-old and 14-year-old grandsons each spent a night and enjoyed the space and the great collection of games and toys.,,,,,
The kitchenette is minimal but adequate for basic provisions and simple meals. It was nice to find a quart of milk in the frig.,,,,,
It's an old house,so fixtures,faucets,"tub/shower and electrical outlets are \"\"vintage\"\". Everything works",though,and the age of the space adds to its charm.
"The air conditioners work well; this is important during Boston summers. \"",,,,,
1692573,16487105,2014-07-28,17438214,Frederik,Everything was well organized & arranged. Perfect location for a visit of Boston. The house is located in a very nice neighborhood with everything nearby.

1692573,18536162,2014-08-28,7762926,Edith,This was a great place to stay. Everything was as described. We stayed for 6 nights with our 2 teenagers. We were made to feel quite welcome. The place was quite roomy and well appointed. I would definitely stay here again.

1692573,19674232,2014-09-16,3172685,Victoria,"Great property, great location and very welcoming hosts. We had the whole of the third floor to ourselves, including a kitchenette and separate bathroom. The milk in the fridge meant we could have a cup of tea on arrival, which was very welcome after our long journey. The beds were very comfy and the whole place was very clean. It is only five minutes walk to the T (Green station on the Orange line) so we were able to get around very easily. JP itself is lovely...walks around the pond, a small drugstore for breakfast supplies, restaurants, everything you need really. We did not see much of our hosts but they were very friendly when we did see them. We could come and go as we pleased and did not feel at all awkward sharing their house. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston."

This was our first time using Airbnb and we would do it again. I highly recommend staying with Kelly and Phil as the location was perfect for visiting Boston. The neighbour hood is stunning."
1692573,20279301,2014-09-27,17364778,Ellen,"My sister and I ( 30) stayed with our elderly parents for 6 nights here (aged 70 & 69). The suburb was quiet and there was a pond close-by. The train station is not too far but the train takes about 30 minutes to down town. We were located on the third floor of the family home and shared their entrance.  If you want your own space i'd suggest renting an apt in the area which we found out later cost the same. If you are working then this area is probably fine but for tourists would suggest some where more central like Back Bay or downtown. Kelly was pleasant and allowed us to make a local call which we appreciated. Unfortunately one incident at the end impacted our experience. We made a mistake with the check out time and thought it was 3pm. We were finalizing our packing when the cleaners came into the house. The host (Phil) came back shortly after and I was disappointed the way he spoke to my elderly parents in a very inappropriate and disrespectful manner. My dad was upset after the encounter . It was a genuine misunderstanding. We hadn't discussed check out times with them (they were away the day before we were due to leave) and were unaware cleaners were due to arrive. At no time was this clarified by the hosts and as soon as we realised, we got out of their way and brought our luggage to the front door immediately. I privately emailed Phil on 27-9-2014 to convey my disappointment at his behaviour to try to resolve this in a cordial manner but never received a reply. (excerpt from email: I do want to express my disappointment at the way the matter was handled. My parents had not booked the bnb and were relying on us for all information. My father was upset after his exchange with Phil on Friday evening, which was rude and unwarranted against my elderly father who was taking all direction from us on the holiday.)The following day I received notification that he had left a review on this site. An apology would have sufficed."

It was very clean.We had two rooms. Both were very nice decorated. We also had a kitchen and our own bathroom. They also prepared breakfast for us on the first day, which was great because we arrived late."
The location is perfect to discover Boston,the neighborhood is very nice.,,,,
We would definetly recommend Kelly and Phil`s place.,,,,,

1692573,20814433,2014-10-06,13927942,Debbie,"We were alittle nervous renting a 3rd floor space because we had my elderly mom with us, but found that it was not difficult for her to get up and down the short stairs at all. She is in great shape!."
The rooms are very comfortable and the beds are the best! There was yogurt,granola and creamer in the fridge,and some of the best coffee ever. Kelly and Phil are very warm and friendly,giving us privacy but providing helpful information about local dining,public transportation and other tips to navigate back and forth to the city.,
We found the public transportation and Uber are the way to go in Boston,as the traffic is so  congested and crazy. It was very easy to get back and forth to the city from Jamaica Plains.. Also,there are some neat restaurants and a little grocery store within walking distance from the house.,,,
The only drawback was that it was alittle challenging to get a parking spot since most of the streets restrict parking to residents. We were able to park some of the time in the driveway,but if you can avoid using a car,that would be easier. The train is just a 5 minute walk and you can easily get a taxi using Uber or other services in area.,,,
"We definitely recommend the Campbell home for a wonderful stay in the Boston area.\"",,,,,

It seemed like a very nice and safe neighborhood - short walk to the train station and short walk to a business area with shops and restaurants.,,,,,
The hosts were flexible with our arrival and departure times.,,,,,
If we were going back to Boston,we would definitely try to arrange to stay again.,,,,

I am a first time user of airbnb and was a bit hesistant travelling with an infant to an unknown home, Kelly and Phil made us feel confortable and is really easy going.  We were on the 3rd floor and shared the stairway with the homeowner, the home has enough segregation which made it more comforting."
The kitchen and bathroom area is top notch,they just renovated that area and it looks really nice and clean.  Bedrooms are spacious and relaxing,clean white sheets on all the beds too.  They provided some yogurt/coffee/cereal that was in the fridge when we arrived,a pleasant surprise!  Shampoos and other bathroom stuff were all quality stuff.,,
Kelly also provided us with a pack and play for our infant,this was great since we didn't bring one!  We were in and out as we pleased,visiting attractions and the local JP area throughout the day.,,,

The bathroom is newly remodeled and very nice.  The beds are comfortable and the whole suite of rooms is immaculate and tastefully decorated.,,,,,
The hosts  had left some snacks and coffee for us,making the first morning easy,no shopping required.  They also provided a list of restaurants and maps and a guidebook about the area. They were accommodating,friendly hosts,but they were not intrusive.,
The location is very convenient for walking to restaurants,coffee shops,stores,Jamaica Pond,"and close to the bus and T stops.  We will definitely stay here again when we next visit the Boston area.\"",

The 3rd floor was all ours, the kitchen area was new and convenient alike the bathroom. Nice big King bed! Excellent job in decorating allover. The area invites for a stroll to admire the gorgeous house, and having coffee on central street a nice treat. The walk to the subway is 10 minutes and in another 10 minutes in the subway you are downtown Boston. A definite recommendation to stay!"

They provided us with loads of information about the neighborhood, restaurants, sites, cafés, etc. and welcomed us warmly. The rooms are beautifully decorated and furnished - and equipped with toys and books that our toddler loved so much that he didn't want to leave. Communication and Check-in were straightforward. The neighborhood is great and laid-back, with lots of parks, playgrounds, cafés, restaurants, shops and a T station nearby. Highly recommended for those (with or without kids) who want to discover Boston without staying in bustling downtown."

The check-in process was smooth with Kelly and Phil.  Although the weather was quite warm (early July) and we were on the third floor, the air conditioners in each of the rooms and dining area made the living space cool.  There are many great restaurants along the main street within walking distance.  The neighborhood is beautiful and safe with many renovated Victorian style houses.  Would certainly recommend to family and friends visiting."

The street was lined with old houses all with distinct characteristics and it was very close to Center Street that had all the amenities you would need. We stayed at Kelly's place for five days in July during an incredibly hot spell that plagued Boston. We arrived on a Saturday and parked our car on the street and left it there for the entire trip. No one was home but Kelly left easy instructions to get into the house. My husband, myself and our two teenagers stayed on the third floor of the house, like a \"\"loft\"\" and you needed to walk up a staircase from the main foyer of the house.  The loft consisted of two bedrooms"

Kelly and her husband communicated with us easily and clearly before the trip and were able to give us helpful info. for our trip planning. The unit is really lovely and comfortable (A/C units were great for the warm summer weather)...they have done a great job on it!
We wished we'd had a bit more time to get to know the neighborhood as it is REALLY great: restaurants,cute shops etc...and they left a binder of info. about it all for us! The walk to the T was really easy and we did it with two kids in (URL HIDDEN) not a big deal and the ride into Boston was a quick 10- 15 mins. depending on where you are going. I had been trying to get a place IN Boston but we are so happy we ended up here! We didn't get to explore the green areas in JP but as we left,we noticed the Jamaica lake and the surrounding park and wished we'd been able to. Kelly was busy the days that we stayed but her husband was available when needed and really nice when he checked in on us the first night. Maybe we'll get to come back someday! It worked out especially well for us as we also had our rental car with us as we were driving across the state to see family and could not get rid of it - it would have been a hassle to deal with it in Boston!! All around,"we would totally recommend this great spot! Thanks Kelly & Phil! \"",,

However when we arrived we found Phil to be incredibly welcoming and friendly. We felt at ease instantly. The area was nice and the house was lovely. We were give a whole floor to ourselves and Phil gave us the utmost respect and privacy. The amenities also were excellent including a pristine bathroom and kitchenette as well as incredibly clean and comfortable beds.

I'm a big fan of staying in bed & breakfasts, so when I tried to make hotel reservations in Boston for my son's Parent's/Family Weekend and found the prices to be somewhat exorbitant, I thought I would give Airbnb a try."
I truly didn't know what to expect,and chose Kelly's place based on its location,its reviews,which were plentiful,and its price,which was lower than what I would have paid at a hotel (particularly with all the extra fees -- although Kelly did charge extra per night per each of my additional boarders).

1692573,80742326,2016-06-19,5125564,Jen,"We had a great time! We were in JP for a wedding just down the street at the Loring-Greenough House. (Worth a visit to the gardens/house or the Thursday night farmers' market, in season.) The location is fabulous for JP in a stunning old neighborhood and close to fun restaurants and some shopping. The space itself is lovely and self contained on the third floor. Immaculate and just the way it looks in the photos. Great collection of kids' books and games for young and old. The kitchen has a small fridge, microwave and toaster oven.  Kelly left us some yogurt, granola, half and half and some excellent coffee. We were very comfortable. Kelly was easy to communicate with and helpful and also let us do our own thing. Would definitely recommend!"
1692573,85513781,2016-07-11,52591672,Ryan,"This was my first Airbnb experience and Kelly made it AWESOME. This is essentially its own apartment complete with a large kitchen, two bedrooms with three comfy beds. Overall a great stay in Boston."
1692573,90640174,2016-08-01,27037637,Frank,"Wir waren drei Nächte in Boston und die Unterkunft hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Es ist alles genau so, wie im Inserat und den Bildern dargestellt. Insbesondere die Nachbarschaft mit tollen Holzhäusern ist klasse; nur 5 Minuten zur T und dann in 20 Minuten ins Zentrum, klappt sehr gut."
Die Wohnung heizt sich allerdings ganz schön auf,es gibt zwar air condition aber die ist nicht superleise. Aber das haben wir gerne in Kauf genommen. Die Gastgeber haben wir leider gar nicht getroffen,sie waren in der Zeit auch teilweise unterwegs. Dies war aber kein Problem,hat alles problemlos geklappt. Und zur Begüßung standen sogar einige Sachen im Kühlschrank,sehr nett. Jamaica Plain ist wirklich schön,"unbedingt einmal in den Nebenstrassen rumlaufen. Gerne wieder.\""
1692573,91064096,2016-08-03,63504630,Kieran,We wanted a place to stay in Jamaica Plain. The location of this house is brilliant. It is a 5 minute walk from the local mbta train station on one side and a 2 minute walk to centre street on the other. The apartment occupies the entire 3rd floor. It was very clean and spacious. There were 3 air conditioning units which was great in the hot weather. Jamaica Plain is a beautiful area and by far my favourite suburb of Boston. Kelly was very fast to respond to all of to our emails. I would highly recommend this.
1692573,92729812,2016-08-09,48119258,Kiana,"Wir wurden herzlich willkommen geheißen und Kelly hatte auch freundlicherweise für uns für das Frühstück etwas besorgt. Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und die Betten sehr bequem  . Kelly  gab uns gute Tipps zum einkaufen und zum Essen gehen. In der Nähe gibt es einen Bio Laden, was wir sehr gut fanden. Wir würden jederzeit wieder bei Celli buchen, wenn wir wieder in Osten sind."
1692573,94490244,2016-08-15,25900390,Tracy,"L'appartement de Kelly est le meilleur parmi tous les logements que nous avons réserves pour notre voyage aux États Unis. Très propre, bien équipé. Le plus important, il y a un cafetier et elle a mis du café et du sucre à la disposition. Et aussi du gel douche, de dentifrice... Petit détail mais nous apprecision beaucoup.  De plus, beaucoup de jeux pour les enfants. Ma fille de 6 ans est enchantée.  Elle ne pense que de rentrer à l'appartement pour jouer... L'appartement est bien situé. A 5 minutes à pieds, des très bons restaurants, des supermarchés, et une très bonne adresse pour les glaces! Kelly a pensé de fournir tous ces informations. Elle nous a conseillé aussi un très bon adresse lors de notre sorti à Flume gorge.  Nous sommes ravis de notre séjour à Boston, notamment chez elle. Merci à Kelly et son mari."
1692573,95037971,2016-08-18,85886419,Scott,"Kelly's place is perfect. Lovely home with two really nice, private bedrooms on the top floor. Kitchen well outfitted, with unexpected milk, a couple of yogurts and granola waiting!  A nice touch. (Coffee too.) Bathroom modern and clean (if not large) and zero complaints from my 21 year old daughter. She loved the place. Location great, beautiful neighborhood, everything you need with really easy access to the Orange line and 39 bus. Getting around Boston a breeze. Definitely would book again, thanks Kelly."

We kept in touch and was great on getting back with me, answering my questions and being really flexible with our check out time. I'm extremely grateful since I'm such a procrastinator. Place was cozy and cool for the summer. Plenty of things to do around town. Super accessible to everything. Tried to do as much as we could. There were even recommendations on where to go. I would stay here again."
5940069,38768097,2015-07-18,37610211,Lauren,"Alejandro was so lovely and accommodating when I arrived in Boston. He was easy to communicate with, and gave me some recommendations for places to see in Boston. Would not hesitate to go back to Alejandro's apartment."

"\"",,,,,
5940069,39665065,2015-07-25,1134885,Edie,"Alejandro was a terrific host.  Although we never actually met him, he sent us by text excellent instructions about entering the apartment and put the keys in a convenient lock-box.  We found the bed very comfortable and enjoyed the fact that this large, airy apartment has great light. A small table with two cafe chairs has been placed by the bay window to enjoy the great view of downtown."
The location is great!  The neighborhood is friendly and very walkable with everything within a block or two,including the T rail-line,which is just a block away.   Alejandro has provided a list of recommendations of things to do/places to eat in the neighborhood.,,,
Visitors should know that the apartment is on the 4th floor up a narrow flight of about 50 stairs,so be prepared and don't bring heavy luggage!  Also,since we are over-forty,"we would have appreciated a couple of comfortable chairs to relax our old bones.\"",,
5940069,40257455,2015-07-29,33294425,Jonathan,Alejandro greeted us upon arrival and was very flexible with our flight being in the evening.  We were provided with water and essentials for our stay.  Everything was very easy and this apartment was a fantastic home base for our stay in Boston!
5940069,40915469,2015-08-03,25495349,Warren,"Alejandro was always quick to respond and very helpful.  The apartment was a in a good location with an easy walk to central Boston.  When we arrived Boston was in the middle of a heatwave.  The bedroom was oppressively hot and when I let Alejandro know, a portable AC unit was fitted the same day which was great.  I was also able to leave my luggage on the day of my departure as I had an evening flight which was helpful."
My only grumble was the lack of comfortable seating.  There were 4 dining type chairs in the living area but no sofa.,,,,,

The location is excellent for exploring Boston, and very close to all the wonderful restaurants in the South End.   I can't thank him enough!"
5940069,67813964,2016-03-31,19314808,Curtis,The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5940069,73683033,2016-05-09,35672367,Sharon,"\"Clean apartment, comfortable beds. \"\"Penthouse\"\" is something of an exaggeration.  The apartment is actually the 4th floor of a 19th century four story walk up.  There was no heat. We were offered the use of a tiny space heater in the living area which was not up to the task of heating the entire apartment. We feel it was overpriced for what we actually got.\""
5940069,76950046,2016-05-29,35859690,Morgan,Alejandro was a great host: timely with all his communications and very welcoming. The apartment is comfortable and in a great location to explore Boston. We had 5 people staying in the space and everyone was happy.
5940069,85102832,2016-07-10,20320010,Meg,"Alejandro and Bryan were wonderful hosts! They were both extremely welcoming and helpful, even when we arrived much later than we'd anticipated. The apartment was very comfortable and conveniently located, and we really appreciated how clean and cozy everything was. Great for our dog, too. Highly recommended!"
5940069,93740348,2016-08-13,5138809,Steven,"Great AirBnB stay at Alejandro's.  Easy check-in and they were very flexible with our checkout.  Space was as described -- it is indeed a 4th floor walk-up but we anticipated that, so all good.  A bit crowded in the living room but it worked well for our party - lots of seating - just something to be aware of.  Overall, satisfied with the stay and would recommend."

The house is exactly as described, very modern and clean, newly remodeled, incredibly comfortable beds.  The kitchen was my favorite, it has everything you need to make a nice dinner.  The area is very quiet and walking distance from grocery stores.  We had four adults and a baby, the house was big enough for everyone to feel very comfortable."
I would definitely stay here again when i visit Boston.,,,,,

7178893,50971482,2015-10-16,31802273,Iain,Great stay in Boston and ideal for my short work trip. Condo was immaculate and perfectly setup.  Communication before my stay was easy and had no issues during the stay.  Location was a short work from the Airport Station on the Blue T line and just a few stops from downtown.
7178893,60609120,2016-01-25,29017448,Ornong,The house is amazingly clean and has got everything we need to have a comfortable stay. The location is super convenient so close to the airport. A great place to stay in Boston.

Boyd gives you a guide of information about the condo of what you can use/not use, a list of restaurants and things to do in the area. Boyd even will give you a Charlie card to use for transportation. The condo was very clean and that the place is even better staying at than a hotel! I would definitely recommend staying here!"
14186170,91248465,2016-08-04,87353979,Kris,"Tj's apartment was absolutely beautiful. This was our first time using air b and b, and he truly made it a great experience. He was available through phone at any moment, and answered all questions that we had. His apartment was in a great location, a short Uber from the quincy market, aquarium, and other attractions you might like to see. The only thing that I had a hard time with (which isn't Tj's fault, it's boston's!) Was the street parking. For some reason Boston doesn't like outsiders parking on the streets but we were able to find a spot a short walk away but keep this in mind. I would definitely recommend staying at the apartment. Thanks again!"
14186170,92403554,2016-08-08,82471805,Dan,The place was clean and very comfortable. TJ was a great host and provided a lot of information about the apartment and gave some great tips about Boston. Parking was very easy on the street around the building. Neighborhood was great and easy to walk some nice shops and restaurants.
14186170,93960085,2016-08-14,22128255,Jose,My friends and I had a great stay at TJ's apartment. The pictures and listing description are accurate. The apartment was clean and everything we needed was provided. TJ was awesome at responding to questions and was always willing to help with suggestions. The apartment is in a nice quiet area with some really good restaurants around and a short uber/taxi drive away from downtown.  I would definitely stay here again!
14186170,95385892,2016-08-19,18588400,Pennington,TJ sent welcome. He responded quickly to every question. It was a great location easy access to food and felt safe
14186170,95990459,2016-08-21,18770879,Melissa,"Loved our stay at TJ's condo this weekend. The condo was great, my boyfriend and I loved the set up. The space itself is big and open. TJ was very helpful and accommodating. The area in South Boston was perfect for our stay, it was close to the areas we were aiming to see, super close to the water, and only a 5 minute drive from a really great bar scene. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you TJ!"
257588,1757706,2012-07-20,95183,David,Meri is a wonderful host. I stay a lot in AirBnb properties and have to say that Mari takes it seriously and responds almost immediately to your requests.
The apartment itself is VERY clean and comfy. Top line kitchen and bathroom,"gorgeous terrace with a grill. They have a dedicated parking place which is really important when you stay in Boston. In Overal this is an excellent example of the luxury apartment and very good host. \"",,,,
257588,1838640,2012-07-30,2744483,Jennifer,"This is the first time I used airbnb and it was such a relief to be able to rent a home and feel secure that it wasn't a scam as we learnt from other sites. The home was beautiful, the host was very accomodating and it made our visit to Boston stressless! Thank you Meredith & airbnb!"
257588,2485795,2012-10-02,3184048,Vincent,"Our stay at Meri's place was just wonderful! The apartment has a very nice decoration with all the confort needed (wifi, TV,...)."
The two rooms are large and one has a king size bed,the other one a queen size.,,,,
Among that,Meri is a great host who helped us finding a solution for an early baggage drop at her place.,,,,
The location of the apartment is also quite convenient as it is not too far from the center (with a taxi,count 5min and $10.- the ride) but it's very quiet (exactly what we where looking for).,,,,
She also gives the hosts great information about the neighborhood,such as take-out and restaurants,shops nearby and activities to do.,,,
We loved our stay in Boston and this is mostly because of Meri's place.,,,,,
Thanks again!,,,,,
"I almost forgot: we loved the Sam Adams beers left in the fridge for our first \"\"apero\"\" in Boston. Best way to begin your stay!\"",,,,,
257588,2524313,2012-10-06,3670180,Michael,"I want to say thank you to Meri for her lovely and warm greeting and accommodation. The apartment is great - fully furnished, clean and cozy. The location is also good - quite but close to almost everything (within 20 mins walking). Great kitchen, bedrooms,  bathroom. Everything was really perfect."
257588,2570730,2012-10-10,3074538,Kristen,"If you are looking for the best of Boston, look no further - this place is fantastic!"
This property has so much space and natural light and is tastefully decorated with comfortable furnishings and every single need or want has been catered for - including the most wonderful shower that lets you wake up fresh in the morning and unwind at the end of each day.,,,,,
The neighbourhood is beautiful and the hosts have thoughtfully provided detail on where to dine,what to see and what to do to in order to best enjoy your time in the local area,and provided tour information for the greater city area.,,,
In addition to this the personal touches (such as stocking up the fridge full of bottled water as they knew I was running the Boston Half Marathon during my stay,and allowing us to leave our luggage in a secure area after check out time due our late flight) that really made this the most enjoyable stay of our whole trip.,,,,
Thanks again Meri!,,,,,
"Don't stay anywhere else in Boston\"",,,,,
257588,2806324,2012-11-05,3270019,Daniel,We had a great stay. Meri was an excellent host that went above and beyond (she stocked her cabinets with all the essentials including much needed Advil!). Great location for heading downtown or attending meetings at the Boston Convention Center. Modern kitchen and decent size flatscreen TV in the living room. Also had the most amazing bathroom with heated floors and waterfall spout that was the icing on an amazing stay. I would def recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in Boston and live in comfort/style. Thank you Meri!!!
257588,4179476,2013-04-16,4790928,Matthew,"Meri's place is in a great Southie neighborhood and is in the perfect location to walk to great breakfast cafes and to the convention center. We had a great time in this very comfortable place, and would not think twice about returning if we're ever in the area again. The back porch is awesome for late-night conversation before retiring to the comfy beds. Thanks!"
257588,4476525,2013-05-07,4837653,Daniel,"This was a great place to stay with my wife and 3 year old son. My wife was attending a conference and the buses worked well, while my son and I enjoyed the nearby beach and neighborhood playground. Meri was very responsive and helpful before the trip and during our stay. We texted her several questions while we were there and she was always quick to reply. She met us when we arrived and showed us the whole place, and even helped carry our suitcases inside."
The house was great; we really enjoyed having a bbq grill and outdoor patio. A great spot for breakfast on a sunny morning too. For other families considering this location I would note that the house is not particularly childproofed and has a steep set of stairs; so it is more family friendly for school age children than preschoolers. It worked fine for us,we just had to keep a close eye on our son and help him with the stairs.,,,,
Overall,"this house was a good fit for our needs and an enjoyable place to stay. \"",,,,
257588,4704970,2013-05-21,4471949,Tharin,Meri's place is very homey and spacious. My family had a very pleasant stay during their visit to Boston. Meri was very helpful and showed us around the house when we checked in. Thanks for letting us stay at your beautiful home!
257588,4808429,2013-05-27,5989582,Matthew`,Meri's place was everything her description and pictures made it out to be.  Very convientent for getting to all the great Boston attractions.  Only complaint would be watch your head at the top of the stairs if your over 6'0'' like me!  Meri was great in coming by explaining everything and also having it all laid out in a binder.  Great vacation highly recommend.
257588,4994834,2013-06-06,5964232,Markus,Perfect Location! Meri is great! Thanks so much for the good time we had.
257588,5044779,2013-06-09,5582976,Sarah,"We enjoyed staying in this beautiful apartment in Boston. The neighbourhood is great. Quiet, friendly with lots of nice restaurants in walking distance and the beach at the end of the road. We drove into Boston everyday and it took about 20 minutes. We looked online for the cheapest parking as it expensive. Meri was a great host. She was very attentive and even bought buckets and spades for my kids to use at the beach which was very sweet. The only thing I would say is that the apartment is not ideal for small children- there are a lot of stairs, a lovely white sofa and beautiful marble counter tops- which I spent a lot of time worrying about my kids messing up. That being said we had a great time and I couldn't rate Meri highly enough as a host."
257588,5182939,2013-06-17,6232806,Renee,We thoroughly enjoyed staying in this beautifully kitted out flat. The shower was really incredible and the beds were comfy. It is a lovely neighbourhood and very easy to get to any part of Boston using the bus and T. The Paramount Cafe up the road is brilliant for breakfast and all the other recommendations Meri made that we tried were excellent.

It is a really big appartment,,,,,
We lived there for 5 nights and for the four of us it was the best,,,,,
Down stairs you can take bus  9 or 11,step out on Broadway station,take the metro there and within 20 minutes you are in the centre of Boston !,,,
I can recommed this apartment to everbody up to 4 persons,,,,,
"Really very very very Nice !!!!!!!!\"",,,,,
257588,5732272,2013-07-14,6201839,Liliane,"We loved the apartment: very light, clean, spacious and quiet in a safe area and a short ride by car from the city. Good shower, and great sofa too! Meri provided two towels each, so convenient. The deck on the backside is really nice. We brought a car and had it on the private parking space a few houses away which was very convenient. Parking in the city and in Cambridge was expensive, be aware!"
It’s only one block from the beach,bring your water shoes for easy access into the water.,,,,
Meri really helped us getting started in Boston with lots of advice on things to do and restaurants,also she had a nice package with leaflets.,,,,
"All in all an excellent start to our holiday!\"",,,,,
257588,5940037,2013-07-23,5030504,Davy,"We've stayed at Meri's condo for a week, and would have gladly stayed longer. Beats any hotel. The pictures reflect the condo perfectly. Close to the beach. Not as nice as other beaches outside of Boston, but still nice to have a walk. Bus to downtown Boston is right in front of the condo, just 15 minutes."
Summertime in Boston is amazing! We had so much fun during the Outside the box festival.,,,,,
Unfortunately we didn't meet Meri in person,but she was so quick to respond any question we had.,,,,
All in all,perfect!,,,,
Thanks Meri,,,,,

257588,6109360,2013-07-30,7086056,Edwin,"Meri's house is beautiful and the pictures really do not do the property justice.  The location is perfect in Southie.  With the beach a block away and two transit lines within a short walk, it is very easy to transit around boston without a car.  Out of my dozen trips to Boston to visit family this is by far the best stay I've had and would love to stay here on my next visit if she's not already booked full."
257588,6199391,2013-08-03,7347557,Cathy,Well situated apartment. Not suitable for kids as sofas are white and the kitchen surfaces were Marble which we were warned would mark if glasses were placed on them.
"Parking was also available which was a plus.\"",,,,,
257588,6393685,2013-08-11,6712755,Bernard,The Meri's flat is the perfect place to stay in Boston.

"Thanks Meri. \"",,,,,
257588,6788944,2013-08-25,7706494,Steve,"You cannot go wrong with the location or quality of accommodations.  My wife, daughter and I just stayed here for six nights and have only positive things to say.  In summary, the location doesn't get better.  It is a short block to the beach.  The South Boston location is excellent.  Very safe, very comfortable, lots of people walking their dogs, jogging, and just milling about.  The accommodations are very contemporary, clean and functional.  The kitchen is gourmet with high end appliances and beautiful marble counters.  There is a large deck on the back with a first-class barbecue.  The bedrooms are spacious and beds are very comfortable.  Even the linens and comforters are great..  The owner, Meri, was very helpful and quick in responding to any questions we had before and during our stay. This was a wonderful experience and we would definitely book again."
257588,7599460,2013-09-26,2768652,Robert,Our party of five stayed at Meri's place.
The communal space for eating,watching TV etc was excellent with good technical facilities and plenty of room even for five. The bedrooms,on the floor above,were fine.,,
The neighbourhood is outstanding with clean streets and a very safe feel. There is a very good supermarket 10 minutes walk away.,,,,,
Although some distance from central Boston,a combination of bus,which passes the front door of the apartment,and subway gets one downtown in 25 minutes and,for holiday makers,adds to the fun!. We came in a car
Our only reservation would be that the two flights of stairs in the apartment are pretty steep. and people who are infirm may find them difficult,particularly moving luggage.Similarly,the bathroom and the bedrooms are on different floors and this may be a problem for some.,,,
However,overall we really liked the apartment and the neighbourhood.,,,,

Le quartier est calme et la maison est magnifique et très fonctionnelle. Tout est neuf et très propre. Les photos publiées correspondent à la réalité."
"\"",,,,,
257588,8365327,2013-10-28,7860770,Miguel,"We loved staying at Meri's place while attending a conference at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Centre. Blieve me, the apartment has everything you will need. It is also conveniently located near public transport (bus) that connects you to both downtown and the convention centre. And with heaps of restaurants and takeouts around the South Boston area, and its proximity to the beach, we really had a superb time. I would not hesitate in recommending you stay at Meri's place instead of staying at a hotel."
257588,8538652,2013-11-04,4163759,Lisa,"We came to Boston for a weekend, and had a great experience staying at Meri's place. It's a stunning, clean, spacious space (comfortable beds, too!), great location. Meir was great at communicating and left all the info we needed to make sure we had the best stay possible. Definitely would return. Thank you!!"
257588,9022948,2013-12-02,107338,Ellen,"The place is beautiful, spotless and very comfortable.  The location is quiet and accessible to anywhere in Boston. Perfect place to stay while visiting Boston!"
257588,11116170,2014-03-21,2084912,Sascha,In short words: perfect!
I have stayed at Meri's apartment with 2 friends for 10 days and hope to be back soon. It is perfectly placed to get Downtown or further South and the Parking spot 3 houses down the road is great to have as street parking fills up fast in the evening.,,,,,
The apartment itself bright and filled with sunlight. The Balcony includes a BBQ (which we did not use) and provides for some outdoor siting. And the bathroom is just beautiful.,,,,,
Two blocks to the east the street corner features two very nice home style cooking Italian restaurants. They don't look pretty but the pasta was delicious!,,,,,
All together an excellent stay,"a perfect apartment and nice hosts. Antyime happy to visit again.\"",,,,
257588,11791597,2014-04-15,9605549,Miguel,Our stay was very very comfortable. The apartment is in a great location with quick access to most parts of Boston as well as having grocery and other stores very nearby.
As mentioned by others below,the bathroom will simply spoil you,as you'll go home with some home-improvement ideas of your own.,,,
Though we couldn't meet Meri,she made sure that we had everything necessary.,,,,
"Highly recommend staying here!\"",,,,,
257588,12108299,2014-04-23,9431796,Rachel,"Thank you Meri and Jeff!!!! You were such gracious and thoughtful hosts! We had a fabulous time in Boston! Your place is gorgeous! My husband, my parents and I were there for the marathon and were very comfortable. The neighborhood is fantastic and two blocks from the water and a nice little beach area. This was ideal for a little marathon recovery."
"Meri's restaurant recommendations were some of our favorites! Should I make it back to Boston I would love to stay here again. I would highly recommend this place to a friend! \"",,,,,
257588,12580517,2014-05-05,2084912,Sascha,"Our second stay at Meris place was excellent as expected. She even had a couple of new plates and cups, everything else was great as always. The check-in and check-out were easy, parking was provided and the balconies were lovely with the sunny weather. Check out my other review if you want to read more about what is great about this place."
257588,14142856,2014-06-13,7891540,Jed,"Meri's South Boston condo was roomy, bright and clean.  We especially liked the attached deck.  The combination locked entry made it easy on arrival date (no need to get a key).   The neighborhood was great - there are many young professionals.  The condo exceeded out expectations, and would stay there again."
257588,14347425,2014-06-17,11676556,Franco,"Meri's home was the perfect base to visit Boston. With all the amenities we needed, we found it was in a great central location to visit other areas of Boston and the actual neighborhood it is in was wonderful to walk around."
"I do plan on coming to Boston again and won't hesitate to contact Meri for my next stay.\"",,,,,
257588,14819219,2014-06-27,6662004,Ron,"What a great place to stay in Boston!    Only 2 blocks from the beach and conveniently close to downtown.  The assigned parking spot that comes with the rental was extremely convenient for our car.  Meri was great in getting back to me with any questions I had.  We loved the kitchen and especially enjoyed the bathroom with the 7 shower heads!   We had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay again.   Only concern is that I would advise caution to anyone that has problem climbing (URL HIDDEN) two bedrooms are located on the second floor, but the bathroom is located on the first floor."
257588,17259499,2014-08-10,7593675,Stas,We really had an awesome experience staying in this property. The apartment is cosy and nicely decorated. We thoroughly enjoyed the huge balcony with barbecue on it. The location is nice too. Will definitely return!
257588,17744236,2014-08-17,12410560,Caroline,De loin Meri est la meilleure!!!
Sa maison est super sans aucune mauvaise surprise,c'est exactement à l'image des photos : spacieuse,belle,lumineuse,très bien équipée,haut de gamme et hyper propre et l'emplacement dans South Boston vraiment agréable.
Meri est toujours très disponible et répond très rapidement à toutes les questions,ces conseils à dispositions dans la maison et sur airbnb sont très précieux.,,,,
Nous recommandons hautement sa maison!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
257588,17943751,2014-08-19,17350777,Leanne,Meri was a truly gracious host. She was responsive to every need. Her place was really lovely-- and true to its description. Would highly recommend.
257588,18888928,2014-09-02,15547142,Maria,"Meri and Jeff were wonderful hosts and their place is beautiful! Although I did not meet Meri in person, she was very helpful and alway willing to answer any questions during our stay. The beds were extremely comfortable and the location was great. It is literally a few blocks from the beach and it is walkable to public transportation (bus stops), which make it ideal for exploring the city. The parking spot for the house is also very helpful (since parking does seem to be limited). I highly recommend this apartment!"
257588,19813611,2014-09-19,7183096,Evan,"We had an awesome stay at Meri's place. It's incredibly convenient to the Boston convention and exhibition center, lots of cool neighborhood restaurants, and an awesome Harbor walk area for running/walking.  streets are well lit, neighborhood seems very safe, and the accommodations are very very nice."
257588,20419524,2014-09-29,1795849,Kevin,"Meri's 2 story apartment is absolutely beautiful! I am a very particular person when it comes to accommodations, and Meri's place made me feel very comfortable and right at home! The place is very nicely decorated, and everything you would need are all right there in the apartment. My friends and I especially enjoyed the large balcony in the backyard, spent every evening out there with the beautiful weather we had. There are no words to describe the washroom, as one can only experience it to understand the magic that is the shower... and this is coming from a guy."
I did not get to meet Meri personally,however she has reached out to me a few days prior to my trip,and had given me clear instructions on what to do once I get to the apartment. We had consistent communication throughout the entire duration of my stay,and Meri is always quick to respond to any questions I had.,,
There is a bus stop right outside the apartment that takes you to a couple of T stations in the area. There are also quite a few nice restaurants in the area,all outlined in a binder in the apartment. Just a few minutes away is the beach,and the nearby Dorchester Heights is truly a hidden gem in South Boston. I personally really enjoyed the safe,friendly neighborhood; there are always people walking their dogs and jogging in the evening.,,
When I do come back to Boston,"I will for sure stay at Meri's again! Thanks for your hospitality Meri.\"",,,,
257588,20624483,2014-10-02,1774295,Allison,The apt was great! Convenient and nice little local neighborhood.
257588,20900630,2014-10-07,19738888,Peter,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it will be difficult to surpass.  Meri's home is beautiful."
The kitchen is superb,and so well equipped that we cooked almost all our suppers.  The living space is comfortable,and the beds brilliant.,,,
The shower is unbelievable!,,,,,
Meri was very welcoming,and very responsive to (few) issues.,,,,
The neighbourhood of South Boston is delightful.  The local corner shop (K8) has a wonderful range of high quality meat and fish,"and Broadway (10 mins walk) has everything else you could possibly need.  We found everyone very friendly.\"",,,,
257588,21025368,2014-10-10,4681584,Romeo,Meri's place is exactly as it appears in the pictures. It is a beautiful place and we really enjoyed our stay there. Meri was very responsive with all of our questions and gave very detailed instructions which made life very easy. We would definitely recommend her place for a stay in Boston.
257588,21276907,2014-10-14,15720992,Heather,Meri made our family feel welcome as soon as we booked the listing months earlier and it kept up right though our stay. She checked in often to see how we were faring and offered fantastic suggestions for things to do. The place was immaculate and well-appointed in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. We will definitely be back!
257588,21424945,2014-10-17,21058114,Catherine,"We were on a flying visit to Boston for a few days, our first visit...what a great city. It was all made very special by our stay at Meri's lovely apartment. It is in a very nice, friendly neighbourhood and a perfect location to take a cab from or walk into the city. The apartment is beautifully appointed - the best shower, quality bed linen and towels. Meri was very helpfull and responsive to any questions we had. As recommended, we had a super brunch in The Paramount and the best seafood in The Legal (URL HIDDEN) good we went there twice!!  Bostonians are the friendliest people we've experienced in all our travels. So this was a trip we'll remember and hope to repeat sometime soon. Thanks Meri"
257588,21586001,2014-10-20,18961585,Kerri,"Meri was an excellent host! She communicated with me several times in the week leading up to the rental to make sure I had all of the info.  The unit was just as nice as the pictures and easily accommodated 5 of us during our stay.  Lots of open space for relaxing, a great kitchen for cooking, and private bedrooms upstairs to retreat to.  Located in a great part of Southie, it was easy to find parking and get in/out of the city using public transportation, plus it is close to great restaurants!  Being close to the beach was a nice perk for guests looking to go for a run along the water!  Would absolutely rent this unit again - definitely beats staying in a hotel!!!"
257588,21776442,2014-10-24,11376799,Dorice,"Great experience. The apartment was everything Meri and Jeff promised. Very spacious, beds were king size and very comfortable. Transport just outside the door. Communication was great with lots of to do brochures left in the apartment for us.  Would recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in Boston."
257588,21962510,2014-10-27,21732193,Jonathan,"The photos in the listing are accurate and the condo was clean and well maintained. The surrounding neighborhood is nice, with close proximity to the beach and nice walking/running paths. We had some difficulties with parking but working with Meri it came to a good conclusion. Check in and check out was simple and painless. House rules were simple and unobtrusive."
While the listing states it accommodates 3,it truly accommodates the number of people you want to put into the 2 closed bedrooms. Our group consisted of 3 individuals in Boston to attend a conference and each sleeping separately (no couples). We set up the air mattress (comfortable and easy to set up) in the living room downstairs. We had a really hard time balancing the heating so that the person downstairs was comfortable and those upstairs were not too hot. There are also no curtains/blinds in the living room,so there is little privacy for anyone sleeping on the air mattress in the living room and there is a street lamp just outside the window that stays on overnight.,,,
All in all,"I would return as a small group/2 couples not needing the air mattress and using the two bedrooms with comfortable beds.\"",,,,
257588,22887763,2014-11-17,8972870,Sally,"The apartment was wonderful and so clean. It exceeded expectations. The neighborhood was great, and walking distance to some great eclectic shopping and restraunts. The host made some great suggestions like using UBER . We had a great girls weekend get away........will be back next year. Thanks Meri"
257588,22994657,2014-11-19,4411959,Michael,Very good experience.  The place is as advertised and Meri made the process very easy.  I would recommend this spot

257588,23529310,2014-12-03,23395410,Debbie,"\"Meri was as advertised... GREAT !  From her attention to detail setting us up prior to our arrival, to checking on us throughout our stay.  We always felt in control, with all our questions answered in advance.  The facility is as great as it looks and even more comfortable.  South Boston was an amazing place.  The neighborhood shops such as bakery, butcher, liquor store were run by colorful friendly souls who grew up here and excude the flavor of \"\"Southy\"\".  As 1st timers to Boston"
257588,24178623,2014-12-22,22126362,Natalie,"The host was exceptionally professional, responsive, and accommodating.  Even the finest boutique hotels don't answer questions via text messages within minutes."
257588,25009108,2015-01-05,21732909,Andreas,I truly recommend this apartment. Great location and everything that´s needed for a homelike experience. Very easy to get accommodated - through crystal-clear guidelines provided by the host. Comfortable furniture and all tech-stuff that´s needed.

Our host was organized, communicative, and provided an accurate description of the amenities and features of the property. She helped us map out available parking during the Boston snowpocalypse, provided great recommendations for grocery stores and surrounding activities, and the house was well stocked with linens, staples, cleaning, cooking supplies."
"The neighborhood was very accessible to public transport and walkable to the Boston Convention Center. We had a fifth member of our party and they were very comfortable on the provided air mattress and linens. \"",,,,,
257588,28071603,2015-03-17,387916,Caitlin,Great house and great location. We had a blast and the house was beautiful.
257588,28991108,2015-04-02,22651916,Maria,"My husband and I enjoyed staying at Meri's place while attending a conference at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center. The apartment is in a nice, quiet neighbourhood and is well equipped, as described. Several restaurants, bars and grocery store are within 10-15 min walking distance. The weather was not conducive to sitting outside, but the porch must be nice in the summer. Internet was fast and flawless. It was easy to use Uber for getting around (bus line was re-routed during our stay)."
One reservation were the white marble countertops that need to be covered to protect from possible stains,but plenty of placemats,coasters and paper towels are provided. Also the bathroom,kitchen and living space are on the first floor,while the bedrooms are on the second floor,which was not a problem for us
We did not meet Meri,"but everything was arranged before our arrival (access via combination lock for easy entry) and she was  responsive and helpful during our stay. We would certainly consider coming back on our next visit to Boston.\"",,,,

The apartment is very clean, with updated furnishings and appliances.  The hosts were were available any time we had questions, before and during our trip. Our daughter lives in Boston, so we will defiantly be back and will recommend the apartment to our friends and family."
257588,30437472,2015-04-22,21692876,Shane,My family and I just stayed here for the week up to and including Marathon Weekend!   This was my first airbnb experience and it was a great one.
This place is awesome.  Clean,bright,and comfortable.  The back patio is great to chill on and gets some nice sun.  For me,being so close to the water makes it the best location ever.  I went for amazing runs along the Harborwalk (while my family walked).  Running around Pleasure Bay is super cool!   We took the city bus right outside for quick transportation downtown.,,
The only things I missed were a bathtub and,because I was visiting from another country,a local land line would have made it easier to call taxis,order take out etc...  BUT,even without a bathtub,the bathroom is spectacular and the shower is beyond.  I just wanted to shower all the time!!
Meri,though we didn't meet,rocks.  She kept in touch and checked in with me during the week to make sure everything was cool (which it was).  The whole neighborhood is very friendly and on a few occasions,gracious locals were happy to point us in whatever direction we needed.,,
All in all,loved it!  Stay here,"it's amazing!\"",,,

We had a little trouble with the air-conditioning but Meri & Jeff responded quickly. The quality of the information provided for us was great too. There are plenty of good eateries within walking distance and adequate shops for groceries. Well located, we would happily stay here again."
257588,38695872,2015-07-18,3858321,Jérôme,"Bonjour,"
La location de Meri est située dans un quartier un peu excentré du centre ville de Boston.,,,,,
Par contre,la maison est juste à côté d’une magnifique plage ou nous sommes baignés presque tous les jours.,,,,
Le quartier est essentiellement « pavillonnaire »,très peu d’immeubles,il est calme et reste néanmoins accessible au centre de Boston assez rapidement. Un bus,toutes les 20 minutes s’arrête presque en face de la maison. Sinon,à pied (comptez 15/20 mm),on rejoint très facilement le métro à Andrew station  en prenant à la 8éme avenue à droite en sortant de la maison et à gauche sur Dorchester street jusqu’à un rond point ou se situe à la station de métro qui relie le centre ville en un petit ¼ heure. Un supermarché est situé à 10/15 mm à pied de la maison.
La maison de Meri est petite mais agréable,un beau séjour/cuisine au premier niveau ainsi que les wc/salle de bain et 2 chambres situées à l’étage. La cuisine est bien équipée.,,,,
Une petite terrasse donne sur la cuisine. La maison est climatisée ce qui permet de mieux supporter les grosses chaleurs sans ouvrir les fenêtres et être dérangé par les bruits de la rue (bonne isolation phonique). Les lits sont confortables et large pour la plus grande chambre.,,,,,
Boston est une ville historique agréable à découvrir à pied. Nous n’avons pas eu le temps de le faire mais il doit être intéressant de visiter les alentours en bus,train ou voiture (Newport,Cap Cod,Marha's Vineyard...).,,
Merci Mery de nous avoir loués votre maison ou nous avons eu plaisir à résider.,,,,,
Bien cordialement.,,,,,
Jérôme.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
257588,39901873,2015-07-27,25963991,Lisa,Meri's house is in a great location - so close to the bus and the beach. The house is roomy and comfortable with a terrific shower. The information provided by Meri is extensive. The photos matched the house. We enjoyed the patios. Access to the house was easy.
257588,40564824,2015-08-01,27059371,Char,Schedules made it impossible to meet face to face but we were able to communicate via text. Location was great. We used metro transportation and the bus was at the corner and about a 5 minute ride to train.
"Accommodation was what was shown in pictures. We would stay again\"",,,,,
257588,42127559,2015-08-11,32203877,Xiangfen,"靠近海边,坐车方便"
257588,43212608,2015-08-18,1995014,Sophie,"We had a great stay at Meris apartment! Everything was perfect, the neighborhood is really quiet but by bus your downtown in 30 minutes."
257588,45566472,2015-09-04,36486236,Carlos,"Muy buena experiencia , la ubicación del departamento fue muy buena, el departamento confortables, limpio, me sentí componen casa . Alquile un auto por unos días y el parking si me fue un pequeño problema que lo supe manejar y solucionar, como recomendación valdría la pena tener el permiso de uso de parking en la zona."
"\"",,,,,
257588,46701671,2015-09-13,23450416,Samantha,James and Sam had a brilliant time in Boston. They loved the house and felt extremely relaxed and comfortable during their stay! The close proximity to the convention centre was a massive plus.
257588,47963353,2015-09-22,36169837,Barry,"Meri did a nice job of providing clear instructions about check-in and check-out. The neighborhood is fantastic, very close to a lovely waterfront and beach. The bus stops on the same block, which was very convenient."
The pictures are accurate and the unit is well-equiped and in good condition. The one negative in our experience was that the steps into the house,and the stairs inside the house,are quite steep. For young people this is not an issue,but for elderly folk,they are difficult to navigate. I wasn't able to figure this out from the pictures.,
There is a nice deck to sit and eat on but there is no dining table inside the unit,"just something to bear in mind based on the weather.\"",,,,
257588,48872742,2015-09-29,14048638,Clinton,"Lovely House as it looks in the add and a really nice location, so easy to get around. This apartment is very well appointed and the shower is amazing! as is the outdoor deck. Thank you so much for a lovely stay."
257588,49188867,2015-10-01,44996569,Justin,"We used Meri's apartment for a video shoot for a few hours.  Though we did not sleep in the beds, I can say that the pictures are accurate and it is a beautiful apartment.  We would use it again!"
257588,49986525,2015-10-08,30604588,Carole,The apartment is nicely decorated with a good spacious feel to it and is well set up to enjoy the beach which is only a short walk. It would be great for a family in the summer as there is a large well equipped kitchen and nice outdoor eating but no table for eating inside. It is not really suitable for elderly people or anyone with mobility limitations since the bedrooms are upstairs and the bathroom is located down a narrow staircase with tight turns and there is a steep staircase to enter the apartment. Meri was responsive to fixing several issues we encountered upon arrival.
257588,50330291,2015-10-11,28520038,Barbe,"Meredith was very welcoming, and told us a lot about the neighborhood.  One night we grilled steak from the corner store with the great butcher - fantastic meal ( great tip).  We walked to the subway line, put our feet in the cool October water at the beach, and walked to a great local restaurant."
257588,51089094,2015-10-17,45194015,Torsten,Simply the best apartment for a family like us. The bus to city stops just outside the door. The beach is just 2 minutes walk. We really enyoued this clean apartment. Communication with Mary was perfect.
257588,51691840,2015-10-24,34176645,Jaryd,"Great retreat in South Boston! Beautiful home, central location for seeing the sites. Couldn't have been better! We used Uber to get around, which was by far the easiest and cheapest form of transport in Boston."
257588,52204715,2015-10-27,4263792,Steve,Excellent accommodation in good location as long as you don't try to park a car!! Plenty of public transport however and good communication from Meri the host.
257588,52500200,2015-10-30,1930834,John,Meri's place was as advertised. Quite spacious for Boston standards and can easily fit 4-5 adults. The air mattress and couch were comfy. Location is close to the conference center. Didn't really explore the neighborhood much as I was in Boston for a conference. Loved the rain showerhead. Would definitely recommend for anyone staying in Boston. Didn't get to meet Meri but she was very prompt with communication.
257588,53079622,2015-11-04,6061104,Omer,"Meri was a wonderful host - answering our questions quickly and with details. The place itself looks likes. It was very comfortable, and very homey. Conveniently located about 15 minutes from the Airport. Would definitely stay there again! Thanks Meri!"

257588,61263578,2016-02-01,55678299,Joanna,"Meri and Jeff were great hosts. Meri was easy to reach and got back to me with any questions right away. The apartment is clean and well maintained (it looks exactly like the pictures). I am someone who suffers from allergies so traveling is difficult and often uncomfortable. However, I did not have any discomfort at my stay in this location-which is a big deal for those of us who suffer from allergies. I look forward to staying in this location again soon."
257588,62639265,2016-02-15,49451922,Tiffany,"I stayed at Meri's condo for Valentine's Day with my fiancé and two close friends. The apartment was beautiful, well-kept, and extremely cozy. Meri was extremely helpful and had booklets of information for how to work the various appliances in the home and pamphlets for the hotspots in the city. I would definitely recommend this condo to families, couples, or singles looking for an Airbnb close to Boston downtown, beaches, and restaurants."
257588,63250693,2016-02-21,58241480,Mary Ann,My co-workers and I thoroughly enjoyed Meri's lovely and bright apartment. We stayed while attending a conference at the waterfront.

257588,68065725,2016-04-02,47785060,Hilda,We were delighted with our accommodation for the week. Host was available for any questions but we had none as house was so well organised and labelled.
It was spotlessly clean,with a fantastic well equipped kitchen. I'm so jealous of your appliances. Extremely comfortable beds!! Excellent location with so much in walking distance.  We used Uber to get about quickly,thanks for the tip Meri.,,,

The apartment looks exactly as the pictures displayed online, but even more beautiful in person! The kitchen was well stocked and had all necessary items needed to grill, cook or make some cocktails. She left a detailed binder of nearby restaurants, shops and tourist sites, which is perfect for newcomers to Boston! The entire place was clean, cozy and comfortable. But, the bathroom absolutely stole the spotlight - it's stunning! You felt like you were in a spa instead of someone's home! Overall it was a great stay. Meri reached out after our first night to see if we needed anything, which was very much appreciated. I would recommend her home to anyone who is visiting Boston!"
257588,70730110,2016-04-20,31667338,Judy,First time using airbnb and I must admit it was great!
Meri's apartment was perfect for us! Looks exactly as the pictures displayed online. The kitchen was great,fully equipped with all the pots/pans & utensils you need. We used peapod service to have groceries delivered to us,which made it very easy.  Meri supplied a very detailed binder of nearby restaurants in the area,along with tourist site info. Easy access to Downtown Boston,bus service approx. 100 feet away from front door ( 15-18 min ride). Uber also easily available.,
The bedrooms were clean & cozy and good size.,,,,,
Meri was great about checking in with us to see if there was anything we needed.,,,,,
We did not use the beach but its close proximity to the apartment was ideal!,,,,,

257588,73100656,2016-05-06,46966823,Tamsen,Meri's apartment in South Boston was an excellent location for all our needs. We had a special event to attend and got in some sightseeing as well. Everything was easily accessible from this neighborhood plus the local area was a treat as well. Good restaurants and a beach right in the city! The beds were extremely comfortable and everything was clean and well appointed. The over-sized shower was a great reward after being an all about town tourist all day. We would definitely use this apartment again for our next Boston trip!

I will caution that this unit is not well suited for very tall people and people who have mobility issues,"due to low ceilings in bedrooms and the steep stairs. \"",,,,

257588,75856680,2016-05-23,59631879,Carol Ann,We rented this beautiful place for my son's graduation weekend. It was the perfect spot for my family. The house is well appointed and looks exactly as it does online. It's immaculate. Meri is very responsive and helpful. I'd go back in a heartbeat.
257588,76255611,2016-05-26,53581096,Brittany,Meri's home was a wonderful fit for my family and I while visiting Boston!
The open living space,large patio and shower were some of my favorite features.,,,,
For anyone thinking about renting a car,here is a little FYI: We had to park our rental car at a car garage 1.5 miles away. (about a 7 minute drive) so if you don't plan on traveling out of the city much,I highly recommend using Uber,Lyft or public transportation. Meri's house is conveniently located and we didn't need our car once.,,
If and when we're back in Boston,we'll be sure to stay here again.,,,,
Thanks for being such a wonderful host,"Meri! \"",,,,

My family stayed here for Harvard commencement weekend, and it was a serene respite from the city and the busy graduation festivities. It was the first hot weekend of the year, and we so appreciated the central AC, access to the beach, and other house amenities. Meri was a pleasure to speak to from booking to checking out, and we were able to access the place with complete ease."

257588,78992960,2016-06-10,923811,Peter,Meri was a fantastic host. Great communication. It's a very convenient location in South Boston. The home was beautiful. Staying here instead of a hotel while attending our conference was definitely the right choice as we had such a nice place to stay and unwind after a busy day! Had one issue with one of the bedrooms but it was handled promptly. Only thing that could have been better is if they left a note with an apology for the situation but I understand random stuff happens in life! Really wonderful memories were created during our stay in Boston!
257588,80030607,2016-06-15,35187688,Jonathan,"After a long road from New-York, we were delighted to discover Meri’s place. The house was beautiful and we enjoyed relaxing in the big open living space.  According to me, the best features in the apartment were the beds (really comfortable) and the shower (Oh my God experience)."
Meri was really concerned about us getting a great experience at her place and she regularly checked on us to be sure that we didn’t have any concerns about the apartment. Meri’s guide on airbnb website helped us a lot to get familiar with the neighbourhood.,,,,,
The only attention point for us was the overnight parking in the neighbourhood on weekdays but we succeeded with a little patience to park our car at the municipal parking on West Broadway.,,,,,

257588,85090631,2016-07-10,57296357,Jana,Meri was wonderful at communication before check in and during our stay. The location is great...we loved walking to the Tavern at night. We felt very safe in this area. Uber was a breeze in Boston. The only tricky part is the parking...but it is a big city so we expected it. Home is very comfortable but it does require walking up stairs both to get to it and once inside (bedrooms are upstairs and the bathroom is on the main floor) The air mattress that was provided was perfect for my kids and much appreciated (and comfortable/easy to use) Kitchen was well stocked with anything you need to cook. We enjoyed the back patio at night as well. I would defiantly recommend this home! Thanks Meri for opening it up to our family. Boston was GREAT!

It has everything you could possibly need. We loved sitting on the back deck in the evening and cooking in the kitchen. Meri had left some bottled water for us, Thanks! There was all kinds of spices, condiments, coffee, sugar, creamer, etc...The neighborhood was nice and laid back. We walked to the corner store for supplies. There is a Stop and Shop and a liquor stores on Broadway less than a mile away. We walked like one block to Carson Beach, which was nice. Meri had all kinds of brochures out and a bunch of recommendations. Our favorite feature was the shower! I highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Boston. Just an FYI: There is a bunch of steep stairs to get both into the apartment and to the bedrooms and there is one bathroom that is not on the same floor as the bedrooms. Also, it gets hot upstairs(where the bedrooms are). Even still it was one of the nicest Air BNB that I have stayed in."
257588,87964220,2016-07-22,11912080,Lydia,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Meri's lovely home. This was our first Air BnB and a great success. The house is in a lovely friendly neighborhood  well served with local stores and a great bus route in to the center of Boston.  The house is beautiful and extremely well equipped. The beds are very comfy and the shower is great! Our Teenage kids loved it (including the wifi and the outside decking and the huge blow up bed!) Meri was a helpful and responsive host. We would strongly recommend this accommodation and would love to return if we visit Boston again.
257588,88494163,2016-07-24,43697868,Liz,The accommodations were absolutely beautiful! Well maintained and so many touches that made it feel like home.

There is a bus stop right in front of the house,but it is not a very fast way to get to the city center.,,,,
In the other hand - the beach is only 300 meters away and you even find towels for the beach in the Appartement. The Uber to the Airport was fast and cost only 26 Dollars.,,,,,

I came from abroad to Boston and picked this Airbnb as my base to search for a long-term apartment,so I needed something clean,quiet,and with good wifi.,,
The best thing about this place was the host - Marie went above and beyond,even picking me up at the airport (for free!); driving me to Best Buy when I needed to buy a phone ASAP,and checking in on me frequently to make sure all was well. She even left tons of fruit,bottled water,and granola bars (as well as shower towel and soap) for me to consume. This is more than any airbnb place has done! Marie was friendly and helpful,and even let me change my reservation in advance from 30 days to 7 after I'd already paid.
- there's a walgreens right next door so you can get the essentials of cereal/shampoo,etc.,,,,
-good wifi access,hot water,heat,etc. The basics are all there,and the air mattress was surprisingly comfortable.,
and the bad..,,,,,
-the neighborhood felt shady and I got cat-called a few times. As  a single woman,I came home each night anyway before 10pm since I was apartment searching,but I don't think I would have felt very safe coming home late,"since the apt. is a 10 minute was from the station. \"",,

The house is just on the border of Jamaica Plain and Brookline. It's not quite convenient if without a car. But if having a car,I would highly recommend it. You will have free park,cooking in kitchen,cosy reading at its open office,not luxury but comfortable,relax and freely.

The place was very clean and charming in a large 1929 house. I had a friend in this part of Boston (Jamaica Plain) and that was my reason for staying there. It's certainly not in the city center and without a car it would have been hard to get there. It's not very close to the T or a bus line that I can see. But with a car or a nearby friend it's a very nice place."

The bathroom with shower is shared with the hosts which was also  just ok.  The neighborhood is very quiet.  Monroe and Mary are very nice- they even loaned us a ladder for a day to help our daughter replace a ceiling fan.
13313124,79180012,2016-06-11,38195330,Vincent,The room was really clean and well described. The appartment was nice although we didn't stay for a long time.
13313124,96843039,2016-08-24,88406845,Dusan,"Carissa's home is nice. The bed is very comfortable, bathroom is clean. I would recommend her place."
10701625,70286883,2016-04-17,47786286,Wesley,It was very good location and nice apartment!
10701625,73662776,2016-05-09,64422930,Paula,"The apartment was as expected.  We had 3 in our group.  I think 4 people in this space would be tight for sleeping but I'm not that familiar with Boston, so that may be the norm.  We did not cook other than using the microwave a couple of times.  The location was great.  Easy walking distance to many shops, restaurants, and a grocery store.  Neighborhood always appeared safe.  We used Uber quite a bit in this area and never had to wait more than two or three minutes.  We received the door codes a few days before arrival via email.  Codes worked flawlessly during our entire stay.  We did not have any issues that made it necessary to contact the host during our stay."
10701625,75930569,2016-05-23,13567721,Gaewalin,"The apartment is in a perfect location to explore Back Bay and Boston. It is a short walk to Salted Pig, which is one of our favorite restaurants in Boston. The apartment is in a short walking distance to the Pru (Prudential Center) and the Copley Square. It is a great place if you have two people staying here, it was not that comfortable for 3 and more and we had 4 in our group. The Wi-Fi was extremely slow here even with a standard activity on internet. The apartment is on a 3rd floor without an elevator so be mindful if you come with an elderly. The check-in and check-out were very convenient with the keyless entrance to the building and the apartment."
10701625,89029919,2016-07-26,84001086,AnneMarie,"Great location in the Back Bay Area. The apartment was clean, quiet and very comfortable. A lovely, convenient choice!"

3294152,15284557,2014-07-06,17153715,Antoine,We had a great time staying in this apartment for our 3 days visit in Boston !
The place is in the basement of a nice Victorian house full of art on top of a hill at 10 min walking distance to the metro and pretty close to the beach. Basically in 20 min you can get pretty much anywhere in town. Jessica was an excellent host,"very friendly and helpful ! We had a great time for the 4th of July with her and the other people staying in the house. I really recommend to anyone in visit in Boston for a couple of days.\"",,,,
3294152,16568771,2014-07-29,8891481,Laurent,"Très bon accueil et une réactivité parfaite pour réparer une serrure récalcitrante dès notre arrivée. Petit appartement, un peu sombre, mais très bien situé pour circuler en bus et metro. Très calme, quartier sympa au milieu de la verdure."
See you soon Jess.,,,,,

3294152,16696236,2014-07-31,19031291,Sabrina,"Nous avons réservé moins de 12 heures à l’avance et Jessica nous a répondu très rapidement! Le « Garden apartment »  était tel que décrit. Bien situé, car près du métro (subway). On pouvait laisser notre voiture dans la rue, sans restriction de stationnement. Jessica nous a très bien accueillis. Elle nous a parlé d’endroits à visiter à Boston et des services près de sa maison. Nous lui avons laissé des billets pour le Museum of Fine Arts et elle nous a proposé des billets pour le Zoo en échange. Un bel endroit calme pour passer quelques jours!"
3294152,16855447,2014-08-03,18047353,Heather,"The apartment was cute, clean and in a great location.  Jessica was very proactive and accessible.  Minuses were that we arrived late due to flight and hidden key didn't work - but Jessica resolved it quickly.  Bed is slightly concave and my husband and I kept rolling into each other.  ;)"
3294152,17006210,2014-08-05,18148103,Christian,"Jessica was a great host. She was always available byphone or airbnb. Ever again . It takes 10 min to the subway station, you need only one train for ervery sightseeing"
3294152,17698134,2014-08-16,18209137,Ekaterina,It was a pleasure to stay here.
Jessica is a very friendl,,,,,
y and helpful host. The house is perfectly located to explore Boston and Dorchester,it's 5 min by foot from the subway station,which is 4-6 stops away from the city center. If you have a car and a will to explore small towns near Boston the house location would be suitable  for this too. It seems it's a safe place to return late at night.,,,
The house looks cosy,the guest area has enough space inside as well as outside,a huge plus of guest area  is an ability to have your tea,breakfast or any time meal outside on the deck surrounded by trees; there are the equipped non-shared kitchen in the guest area and an access to the shared laundry facilities inside the house. There is not a lot of free space in the street to park your car at night,but there is a chance to find the place; the day time parking is without any problem.,
On the way from the house to the subway station there are located some supermarkets,a pizzeria and an Indian restaurant,another local cosy restaraunt is located approx opposite the subway station. The car rental Hertz is approx  15 min walking distance from the house.,,,
So the house and area around it has almost everything more actual for a traveller. Jessica is the highly recommended host and the house is the highly recommended place to stay in and to explore Boston.,,,,,

3294152,18906396,2014-09-02,7686293,Charlotte,"Jessica was a really nice host, she was very friendly and gave us a lot of good advice! The apartment was clean and well equipped. We especially liked, that we could do our laundry during our stay. The immediate neighborhood ist quite good, but at night you shouldn't walk around in Dorchester."
3294152,19212471,2014-09-08,19620680,Mark,"It was my birthday weekend in Boston. Had a great time with my girlfriend! the apartment is in a great location and in a very quiet neighbourhood! we were so close to the train that it wasnt a problem to go downtown, come back for a couple hours then go back for more fun! considering prices of hotels in downtown boston, staying at Jessica's place was a no brainer! the place was very clean and had some maps and site-seeing books to help us get started!"
"Thanks Jessica\"",,,,,
3294152,21277827,2014-10-14,4139969,Ann,"Jessica was a warm, welcoming host and very attentive to our needs. The neighborhood is lovely and very residential, i.e. not a lot of cafes or shops, but it is a short walk to the T, and the nearby beach is pretty. The apt is simple but cozy and the bed is very comfortable!"
3294152,21657136,2014-10-21,7639676,Chanon,"Zero complaints. The space is incredible. It's about a 10 minute walk from the train station(trains come every 15 minutes). There's a great bar down the road called the harp and bard which has great food. Jessica was a fantastic host. When we arrived there was a VHS tape in the machine ready to go which was the castle(a classic Australian movie) and since we were both from Australia it was very refreshing to watch. She also recommend plenty of places for us to go with detailed instructions on how to get there, tourist attractions/places to eat. I definitely recommend this place if you're planning to head to boston."
3294152,22542682,2014-11-09,2713451,Sergio,"Esperienza molto piacevole. L’appartamento è abbastanza piccolo, ma molto confortevole e pulito. Il wifi funziona bene. Il riscaldamento è regolabile e funziona egregiamente."
Letto comodo (materasso molto morbido) con cuscini e coperte a volontà. L’appartamento è in una zona molto tranquilla,quindi niente rumori notturni. Le finestre non hanno scuri,ma da quelle della camera da letto filtra comunque pochissima luce,quindi la mattina si riesce a dormire tranquillamente.,,
Bagno e doccia OK,molti asciugamani a disposizione,ma non c'è un asciugacapelli (noi avevamo il nostro,ma non escludo che chiedendo alla padrona se ne possa avere uno a disposizione).,,
L’unica pecca dell’appartamento è che è poco luminoso visto che in parte è semi-interrato. Dato il caldo di Boston in estate credo che non sia un problema,anzi,rimane più fresco. D’inverno,se si passa molto tempo in casa non è il massimo.,,
Ottima posizione,a meno di 10 minuti a piedi dalla fermata di Savin Hill,da lì in circa 20 minuti si arriva in centro,in 30 si raggiunge Harvard e in 40 si può arrivare a Back Bay. È nella parte nord del quartiere che è piuttosto tranquilla e sicura,abbiamo preso la metropolitana di notte varie volte e ci siamo sentiti sempre al sicuro. Proprio di fianco alla stazione c'è anche uno dei migliori posti dove fare colazione in tutta Boston: McKenna.,
Jessica è molto disponibile e cordiale,e ci ha permesso di modificare la nostra prenotazione quando abbiamo deciso di partire con una settimana di anticipo,tra l’altro parla anche italiano.,,,
In definitiva ottima esperienza,"tornerei sicuramente.\"",,,,
3294152,22683303,2014-11-11,13377921,Ariel,"Jessica was a great and responsive host. We showed up a little last minute and she was gracious in her welcome. The space was clean and inviting and felt very safe. The neighborhood is so fun, and it's a close walk/bike ride to the red line to get right into the heart of downtown."
3294152,22995393,2014-11-19,13057966,Adam,"Jessica was a fantastic host! Her and her family were very welcoming and kept to themselves. The apartment was also beautiful in an excellent area of Boston, with just a 5 minute walk to the subway and a 10 minute train ride from the downtown centre. I highly recommend staying here!"

3294152,30437981,2015-04-22,8201552,Samuel,"Great place to stay for a quick weekend.  Apartment was right-sized for two people and kitchen was well equipped.  The weather wasn't great during our stay so we didn't get to enjoy the deck but think that would have been nice.  My trip was quick and I had a lot of things going on so didn't get to meet Jessica but she did reach out regularly to see if we were OK or needed anything.  It's not downtown, but it's tucked away in a lovely neighborhood with locals, which I prefer over downtown hotels, and accessible from the red line.  I'd stay here again."
3294152,31042165,2015-05-01,6689355,Klaus,"Very nice apartment. Separate entrance. Nice bedroom, comfortable bed, small living room with dining area, well equipped kitchen, nice bath. The deck is great with nice view.  Great location, nice neighborhood. 8 minutes walk to subway (Red Line, 4 stops to South Station). Close by: Convenience store, Indian restaurant (very good!), great breakfast place (Kenna's)."
Everything you need. Highly recommended!,,,,,

Jessica was very helpful and left plenty advice on what to do in Boston. If we ever go back, we will for sure stay with her again!!"
3294152,31525751,2015-05-06,19681054,Tyler,"Great little place, easy to get around Boston from!"
My wife and I spent part of our honeymoon here. When we got to the apartment they were fixing the bathroom ceiling (the guest before us had knocked some of the paneling down),Jessica was quite apologetic about being in the way (and brought us muffins that night) and went over a really helpful list of things to see and do in Boston why it was being worked on. They had it fixed by that evening leaving us in privacy for the rest of the time.,,,,
Quick walk to the subway (though watch out for the climb back up the hill on your way back to the apartment) and some really good eateries near by.,,,,,
All in all it was an enjoyable stay,Jessica was a good host,"the apartment was clean and comfortable and I would definitely recommend :)\"",,,
3294152,31945267,2015-05-12,29463187,Max,"Having never set foot in the States, let alone Boston, we were unsure what to expect. Upon arrival we were greeted by our host, Jessica, who was absolutely delightful."
The apartment was clean,tidy and generally perfect! The deck and indeed the front garden are fantastic places to enjoy a G&T after a day of sightseeing.,,,,
Jessica provided fact sheets so we could enjoy the local area without the need for research,and included directions to local pubs,cafes,sights and the local Transit station which is within easy walking distance.,,
The apartment itself was deliciously cool even on the hottest evenings.,,,,,
Thank you Jessica for an incredible week and of course all your help,"we both intend to return to your apartment in the future!\"",,,,

Jessica was very welcoming,helpful and on our arrival,she gave us good ideas/guide about Boston,she recommended the best restaurant and pub of the area.,,
The place was very clean,spacious and we felt at home.,,,,
The location is really good,close enough to downtown but away from the touristic route,so you can have a real experience of Boston life.,,,
In general,"we loved Jessica's place and will truly recommend it to anyone. \"",,,,

Jessica was not home while we were there but was always immediately available on the phone if we needed anything or had any questions. She even checked in on us via phone midway to see if we were enjoying our stay. It is a great place- secluded, yet close to Boston to hit the sights. Thank you so much!"
3294152,33654230,2015-05-31,26763956,Tim,"Jessica made our first Airbnb experience a good one. The apartment was clean and just as advertised. The back porch/deck was a very pleasant place to sit for morning coffee and in the evenings after sightseeing. Room rate was a good value during a busy time in May with graduations, etc.  While the Upham's Corner/Savin Hill area is several T stops from the main attractions one gets a feel for local life in this lovely neighborhood with nearby store and T stop. We used the T mostly and uber when we were too tired to make the 8-block walk back up to the apartment. Breakfast at local favorite McKenna's Diner was a real treat. We recommend this property!"

Overall the cleanliness of the unit was good except the bathroom."

3294152,68294299,2016-04-04,24653323,Stephanie,Great place! A lot of rules:) One thing to know is half the apartment (the bedroom) is in the basement so not a lot of light.

She communicated well by leaving a some information for me on how to come/go and a helpful list of suggestions for what to do in the area.

The apartment itself is very basic,as described. Three can sleep there but it gets cozy then.,,,,
We found the apartment clean on the first look but taking a closer look things where not always clean,like the fridge for instance or the shower. It was not heavily dirty but we where just expecting something else for that high amount of money. Even though the pricy city center of Boston is very close,the apartment is overpriced,in our opinion.,,
"In general okay and the best thing of the apartment is definitely the outside balcony and the garden where we could enjoy some breakfast in the sun.\"",,,,,

I should say that neighborhood is lovely. From the beginning of the avenue,I felt the depicted Bostonian atmosphere with many original houses up to the top of the hill. The region resembles to that of European cities such as London neighbourhoods.,,,,
After all,"I loved Boston and staying in this house contributed a lot to this experience.\"",,,,
3294152,80214523,2016-06-16,69799606,Sylvain,We spent 2 nights at Jessica's place. Everything was ready to welcome us and we appreciate that. Also she made some efforts to speak French :)
3294152,80703839,2016-06-19,67104895,Jose Luis,"Jessica was a great host, making sure key hand off was seamless and also making himself available if we needed anything, including adapters for phones and tablets.  The apartment itself was exactly as described-nice bedroom in a great neighborhood. A short walk in either direction, restaurantes, supermarket,  subway, ten minutes walk. Would definitely stay here again."
Jessica fue una gran anfitriona,se aseguró que no nos faltara nada,había hasta los adaptadores eléctricos para tablets y teléfonos,nos dejo mucha información sobre Boston,el departamento es super- confortable,esta ubicado en un hermoso vecindario

3294152,81468668,2016-06-23,12720952,Rachel,"This is a nice apartment on the south side of Boston in Dorchester. We really enjoyed exploring the neighborhood around the apartment and taking the T into the city center. The apartment is very comfortable, pleasantly quiet for the most part, and decorated very tastefully. The only negative I would say is that it really doesn't get any sunlight. The description does say that it is partly below ground, but I thought the above ground part would have more windows. It was a little disconcerting when we walked in, but we adjusted to it pretty quickly and the apartment does stay very pleasantly cool."
3294152,82493252,2016-06-27,76635428,Pianp,"Jessica is a very nice and meticulous host. Cleanness of the house, which we value the most, is what we are most satisfied during our stay. The house is suitable for a family -- the size of the coach sofa in the common space is totally enough for 2 adults!"
3294152,84286608,2016-07-06,60293916,Erik,"We stayed over the 4th of July weekend  and the three of us loved this quaint little apt., it was very private and quiet (if you don't count the fireworks that were going off until all hours throughout  the city!)"
As described the apt. was about a 12 minute walk for us to the nearest T (subway) station which allowed us to leave our car behind and use public transportation to get around Boston rather than paying for parking everywhere.,,,,,
The apt. was a comfortable size for three of us,and her newer deck overlooking her garden was a great place to start each day with a cup of coffee and watch the birds and squirrels while we ate breakfast in the morning,"or enjoyed some wine and cheese in the evening.\"",,,
3294152,85263029,2016-07-10,10418215,Myriam,"Our stay at Jessica's was great for what we needed that weekend. I was surprised by how close it was to Boston, downtown, although the neighbourhood is not great to hang out in."
"The wifi wasn't working when we arrived and I texted Jessica right away to let her know and she eventually came to greet us. Since the wifi wasn't working we only had a small TV and VHS movies to chose from so that could have been improved. All in all we felt like we had our own apartment with privacy and all the features your own equipped place would be other than some technical difficulties. \"",,,,,
3294152,86540747,2016-07-16,54318682,Sebastian,"Jessica was really friendly and explained us many useful things, what we can do in the proximity. We had a comfortable stay, and i can totally recommend it."
Jessica war sehr freundlich und hat uns sinnvolle Dinge erklärt,die wir in der Umgebung machen können. Wir hatten einen sehr bequemen Aufenthalt,"den ich absolut weiterempfehlen kann.\"",,,
3294152,87999113,2016-07-22,31471053,Erich,"The listing was accurate, directions are furnished in advance and sets perfect for getting us there with no issues. Or host (Jessica) made communication with us early and then again right before our trip. The place was furnished with everything we needed and she greeted us and checked on us midway through the trip to see we are doing well."
3294152,88992463,2016-07-26,14037108,Christian,Staying at Jessica's place was easy and convenient. We met Jessica in person and she was super friendly and helpful. The bed provided was also very comfortable.
3294152,89326851,2016-07-28,73538566,Luke,half-in/half above ground basement. Has all the essentials. Jessica was very friendly and helpful.
3294152,91186021,2016-08-04,45153332,Camille,We spent 2 nights at Jessica's.
The place is cute,cosy and clean. The kitchen is well supplied. However the bed is really soft so if you have any back pain that might by a trouble for you. The appartment is half below ground and half on the ground floor and because of this the place is very dark,we had to turn the lights on during the day to be comfortable.,,,
Aside of this,there is a very nice deck in front of the apartment where you can sit to have a drink,enjoy the quietness of the place and even use the BBQ if you wish.,,,
Jessica on the other hand has been an amazing host,making sure things would be as easy as possible for us,helping with luggage storage and being very easy to reach,should we have any question. She also gave us plenty of informations about the neighborhood and what to see in Boston.,,
The location is perfect,not too much in the center so it is a nice and quiet neighborhood,but really close to the subway,"and also close to a hubway bike station if you are the sporty type.\"",,
3294152,91786415,2016-08-06,50214762,Geraldine,The appartment is in a quiet area. The subway is at 12 min. The appartment is really dark because it is at the level -1 of the the house. The bedding is good.

3294152,92706266,2016-08-09,27497815,Sandy,Good communication!
3294152,94982981,2016-08-17,187866,John,"Three of us stayed in Jessica's basement apartment for a full week.  We never met Jessica in all that time, and so we were a little bit on our own -- especially because her voice-mailbox was full at the number listed on the AirBnB site. Surprisingly, there was no book or sheet of instructions concerning how the apartment works (for example, what to do with the trash and the recyclables, how to use the oven, washer-dryer, etc.). On the other hand, Jessica has supplied some lovely info concerning the neighborhood and Boston generally. The general positives are, first of all, the place is clean and the beds are comfortable, there are plenty of linens and plenty of towels, and the WiFi works wonderfully.  There is a full-sized refrigerator and some pots and pans and plenty of dishes and glasses and cups. There are many kitchen knives all of which are in serious need of sharpening (dull knives are dangerous knives -- we ended up using our Swiss Army knife a lot). The kitchen is so tiny that only one person can work in there, and the fire extinguisher in the kitchen indicates that it is out of pressure - useless in case of fire. The shower is just fine and there are plenty of extra supplies. The apartment is not air-conditioned, but there is a large portable fan that works well. Parking is easy on the street around the corner at all hours, and on the street in front of the house during the day. But watch out for the street cleaners on Fridays, when you need to watch which side of the street you may park on. The Savin Hill station of the Red Line subway is just over 1/2 mile away.  We walked it every day to go into Boston, but we also noticed that there are a few on-street parking places next to the station if you prefer to park and ride.  The shopping scene is poor.  The nearest regular grocery store is 1.2 miles away and is brilliantly hidden to the south of the JFK Red Line station.  You will have a very hard time figuring out how to get to the store from the station, or how to drive to the store (which we could never figure out how to describe).  Big box stores (Best Buy, Target, etc. ) are about 10 minutes away to the north by car, and the major artery into Boston (I-93) is about 6 minutes away.  The neighborhood is mixed-race, very quiet, and feels secure, and it has wonderful Victorian architecture much of which, however, is in bad shape. The house containing our apartment was in reduced-shape and the garden was grossly overgrown and unattractive. Three blocks away, on Dorchester Street, is a Viet-Namese enclave that includes some really nice authentic eateries at quite modest prices."

3294152,98743307,2016-09-01,90345843,Megan,"Jessica made us feel welcome from the start! She let us drop our luggage off early. The place was very clean and easy to find. There was wifi and an old TV with a VHS player. We had our own private deck with a grill and garden. She had food available for guests. Great location! Within walking distance to the dollar store, liquor store, and many restaurants. Short walk to the redline. Overall, it was a great stay at a great location!"
12318093,73157497,2016-05-07,16850495,Prasad,I stayed at Appleton for 2 weeks during a business trip to Boston. The apartment is well furnished and very cozy. It has got everything needed for a lone traveller (or a couple).
Very close to Back Bay station,so well connected to public transport. The neighborhood is very quiet and classy (Southend).,,,,
I needed an early check-in on a Sunday morning and Ryan was very accommodative for the same.,,,,,
"Highly recommended! \"",,,,,
12318093,78357776,2016-06-06,18638190,Karmy,"My stay at the Airbnb was generally a really positive one. There was a slight hiccup with the air conditioning but Appleton was nice enough to drive back down and install a new one for me and get it resolved. Apartment is on the small side but since my partner and I were out most of the day and utilized the room to sleep it worked out. Location is great, walking distance to many restaurants and Backbay T station and Copley T station. I do recommend this place as it's nice and cozy!"
12318093,83509778,2016-07-03,5202466,Will,"I'll start off by saying that the apartment on Appleton was in great condition and the neighborhood was excellent. It's a small studio but definitely comfortable for 1-2 people and it's complete with washer/dryer, dishwasher, oven and stove. The small outdoor deck off the back was also great and we spent a lot of time out there. The apartment is walking distance to a ton of restaurants, shops, wine stores, etc. and is really in one of the most desirable areas in Boston."
With that said,"we were very disappointed by the lack of \"\"necessities\"\" once we arrived. There was no toilet paper anywhere",no paper towels,no garbage bags,dishes in the dishwasher,and a ton of food in the fridge that had gone bad. Thus the moment we got there we had to run out to buy these things and then clean out the fridge and the rotten food. Additionally
Lastly,every host at other Airbnb/VRBOs where we've stayed have met us at the home to show us around,give us a key,etc. or put the key in a lockbox. The host of this apartment requested we come by his place of work to get the keys (15 minute drive from the apartment) which was very inconvenient with all of our suitcases,our dog,etc. after our long flight from CA
Overall the apartment is cozy and well-appointed and the neighborhood is the real draw,"but we were very disappointed with the lack of attention and care to the actual accommodations and the host's attention to detail.\"",,,,
12318093,88719862,2016-07-25,70569517,Elise,"Great location. Great restaurants nearby. Ryan was very pleasant and good about communicating. Bed was comfortable and a good shower. Apartment was cramped for two people with 1 carry-on suitcase and 1 checked small suitcase. I need surfaces!! The apartment will be really nice once the clutter is removed,some amenities added and some surfaces on which to put one's belongings."
3957602,19762427,2014-09-17,21316714,Patricia,"The hosts made us fell very welcomed,the neighborhood is an urban area,as we had expected.The home is comfortable,needs some work on the outside but that did not deter us."
3957602,19958101,2014-09-21,2921170,Adam,Our stay was amazing!  Scott and Katharine went out of their way to make us feel welcomed into their home!  The lodging was just as described.  The bedroom was spacious and there were lots of places around the house and yard to relax!  They are a very short walk from the transit station and it made getting to my conference a breeze!  The home made granola is wonderful (and if you are lucky Scott will make it in the outdoor stone oven!)
3957602,20299622,2014-09-27,19140284,Jeffrey,Our stay was great!  Scott and Katharine were gracious hosts.   Breakfast was a welcome treat.  The bedroom was large and the TV room futon can also be made into a bed.    House is a 3 minute walk from the Orange line making it easy to get into town.  Train runs every 5-10 minutes during most of the day.  The Jamaica Plain neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and shops is about a 10 minute walk.

3957602,20776192,2014-10-05,21501147,Brian,We recently stayed with Katharine & Scott at 'The Hedges' in Boston.
They were very gracious hosts who provided a delicious breakfast each morning.  The house was very clean and the room was well appointed.,,,,,
Katharine & Scott's local knowledge helped us to get the most out of our trip.  We look forward to staying with them again on our next trip to Boston!,,,,,
The Hedges is also located in trendy Jamaica Plains,which has plenty of good shopping & restaurants.  It is conveniently close to the subway (3 minute walk),"which made exploring Boston very easy.\"",,,

Hearty breakfasts included homemade cereals and muffins. Delightful, walkable and safe neighborhood with many independent shops, cafes, restaurants, bakeries, etc. Excellent location one block walk from Green Street subway station (Orange line)."
3957602,21726743,2014-10-22,3038115,Doug + Jessica,Kit+Scott were gracious welcoming hosts at their lush spot in Jamaica Plain. As we arrived the entire home was filled with the aroma of fresh baked granola - a batch fresh out of the oven! We tried some for breakfast and it was superb! Kit and Scott were fun to talk with in the warmth of their wood-stove toasty living room. We would definitely return there to visit.
Thanks,,,,,

3957602,21987936,2014-10-27,3668730,Kara,Katharine and Scott are great hosts! They are so friendly and welcoming and flexible with check in/out times. We enjoyed talking to them about their recent travels in NZ and they gave us lots of suggestions for things to do in Boston.
They provided breakfast for us each morning which was a great bonus - homemade granola,muffins and pancakes and fruit.,,,,
Our room was spacious,clean and warm and we had our own bathroom too.,,,,
The Hedges is in a great location,less than a 5 min walk from the T (Orange line) and it is a quick trip into downtown Boston,less than 20 minutes.,,,

They have a beautiful, warm home that embraces you. Our daughter lives nearby and was welcomed as well. The description of their home and the environs is accurate.  We will be visiting our daughter again and hope they will put up with us."

We were not in the house much during the day so we didn't get the chance to chat as much as would would have liked but they were very nice and seriously knowledgeable about Boston. We were also given a delicious breakfast which was very much appreciated. Also,they live around 4 blocks away from the Sam Adams brewery which was a great experience as well.,,,,
All in all a wonderful Boston experience thanks to Katharine and Scott. If I return to Boston,"then I know who I am staying with again!\"",,,,

They are interesting people, great conversationalists, and sensitive to the preferences of their guests.  AND, Scott makes excellent breakfast muffins and coffee.  Their house is immaculate, the location is less than 5 minutes from the T stop, and the guest area is spacious and comfortable.  They are close to all the unique shops and restaurants in Jamaica Plain.  Their place is a great place to stay!"
3957602,23842451,2014-12-12,23820544,Molly,"Scott and Kit were both very welcoming and answered all my questions and gave us lots of suggestions of things to do. We had our 6 month old son with us and they were very sweet with him. The area where their house is has a bunch of restaurants and a tasty bakery. They were a very short walk (3-5 min) from the T which makes getting downtown easy. Everything was super clean, and the room had skylights and an empty closet and dresser. Tasty breakfasts in the mornings as well."

From the moment we arrived until our departure, they made us feel welcome and cared for.  Their home is immaculate, warm and cozy.  We appreciated the roomy second floor and enjoyed delicious, homemade breakfasts.  We encountered unexpected weather challenges and Scott and Katharine assisted us in navigating them successfully.  Facing 26 inches of snow - we Southern Belles were in over our heads!  They shared their extensive knowledge of Boston, the trains, the traffic and the closings - allowing us to relax by the wood burning stove as we shifted our plans in short order. Their cheerful natures soothed our concerns about the weather. Basically, we felt like family. We give this airbnb our highest recommendation and will return."

Right from the stage where our Request For Reservation was made by me. They kept in constant touch with us and went out of their way in informing us about how distant; and how to get to where I needed to go to in Boston.,,,,,
They gave us all the relevant information about the restaurants,public transport etc so that our getting around etc was made easy.,,,,
Their place was very neat,comfortable they made us feel absolutely  at home. They went out of their way in providing our morning coffee,exotic teas from the Himalayas,home made granola,cut fruit and the works.,
Most of all,our stay with them did not feel one bit like a commercial  transaction. We felt we were staying with friends who one had known for a long time.,,,,
I would highly recommend their hospitality to anyone who is looking to stay in Boston!,,,,,

Everything was perfect, breakfast of home made granola, one morning, home made muffins another, home made waffles a third! Each morning we had the choice of something different or we could have had toast if we had wanted, fresh tea and coffee etc. The house is lovely, our own upstairs basically with a large room, bathroom and lounge. Kit and Scott were both very helpful in terms of directions, good places to eat, letting us do some washing. Chatting over breakfast each morning was enjoyable and insightful, yet if we had wanted to keep ourselves to our ourselves we could have. The house is very near to the local T and city bikes, a 10 min walk from an area with lots of restaurants. It's a quiet area with great access to the city centre and Jamaica Plain's restaurants and bars. I can't recommend staying highly enough, we would genuinely like to go back on future."

They went out of their way to make my little bro (10 years old) feel right at home, which meant a lot to me. Scott cooked us French toast the first day and fresh blueberry pancakes the next - he was my little brother's hero at that point. I really enjoyed staying with Kit & Scott and hope to see them again soon. I highly recommend this place to anyone."

And a fantastic place to stay on our trip back to our old stomping grounds.  Close to the main drag in JP with great restaurants.  The T is just a hop away.

3957602,54105851,2015-11-16,44419555,Tim,"Thanks to Katharine and Scott, my first airbnb stay was a real pleasure. It was great to be welcomed after a straightforward trip from the airport using the free airport shuttle bus and then the blue and orange T (subway) lines."
It was a treat to have almost the whole of the upstairs floor to myself even though I only spent the hours of 11pm - 10am there because there were so many things I wanted to pack into my Boston visit.,,,,,
I enjoyed the coffee,fresh fruit,granola,yogurt and a variety of baked treats at breakfast time. Travelling on my own it was nice to have Scott to talk to. He could answer my questions about local buildings and the history of this interesting neighbourhood. As I had a Samuel Adams brewery tour (10 minutes walk away) booked for the Friday morning it was interesting to learn that the house was originally built for brewery workers.,,
The Hedges is also within walking distance from the Wonder Spice Cafe,Doyle's Cafe and the Brendan Behan pub providing good local food and drink options in Jamaica Plain.,,,,
With Green Street T station stop nearby,it is also easy to visit downtown Boston and art museums near Fenway (Ruggles stop) without changing. Even museums at M.I.T. and Harvard are easy to reach by changing / transferring to the Red line at Downtown Crossing. The MBTA 7 day link pass on a Charlie ticket is a bargain for $19 (2015) and can be purchased from ticket machines at T (subway) stations.,,,,
"For a scenic change from the city I can also recommend a trip by commuter rail to Rockport and Gloucester (Cape Anne) from North station (Orange line). Salem would be a closer option on the Rockport line but I will have to save that and Boston's Museum of Fine Arts for my next trip to Boston. I know where I want to stay already!\"",,,,,
3957602,54524943,2015-11-21,1854613,Madigan & Magali,"I had a wonderful stay with Kit & Scott. Their bright, historic home is full of character, charm, color, and sunlight. The upstairs living quarters are private and easy to access right from the front door. The bedroom is spacious with a comfortable bed and all the necessaries (closet, desk, wi-fi, drawers, etc); and the bathroom is also spacious with excellent water temperature/pressure—both were quite clean. The neighborhood itself is very convenient to the Green St station (five minute walk) and downtown (15 minutes on the Orange Line). I enjoyed all the shops and restaurants on Centre Street and the beautiful homes around Jamaica Pond."
The best part of the stay is Kit,Scott,and their family. They were so welcoming,striking the perfect balance between warm,"informative conversation and allowing for privacy. Chatting with Scott over breakfast (so delicious!) and with Kit around the house made my stay very special. I felt like I was staying with friends and would happily return.\"",
3957602,57089358,2015-12-21,6626535,Wendie,"This review was written by Namik my friend from Turkey, who stayed with Katharine and Scott:"
I felt so welcome here,it was like a home. I've never stayed at an AirBNB before,so I couldnt believe how they made me feel part of their family... they even invited me to dinner. I like the way they think of the world,they have a real curiosity and were very interested in Turkish history...and I enjoyed time with their son. Scott makes a great breakfast,"the house is very comfortable and close to the subway  into the city so I could come and go easily. I would be very happy to stay here again.\"",
3957602,59669764,2016-01-13,29126142,Sarah,"Kit and Scott are the most lovely and gracious of hosts!  They were both wonderfully accommodating.  I had a great time chatting with them about our mutual interests in traveling and cooking!  The private room and bath was very clean and nicely decorated.  The location of their home is conveniently located next to the subway, which made it easy for me to get to my interviews.  They also offered their driveway so that I'd have a place to park my car.  I would highly recommend staying at their place if you are looking for great hosts, good conversation, and, of course, an affordable way to enjoy the city without having to spend a lot to do so."
3957602,62829432,2016-02-17,13533029,Larry,"The Hedges again provided a fantastic place to be, in a good, safe neighborhood in JP. Scott was very attentive to us and makes a really good homemade granola, along with fresh fruit, yogurt, fabulous fresh muffins and friendly conversation. The bedroom is plenty big and an adjacent lounging room and private bathroom make it a place you can really relax."

The upstairs accommodations were spacious and very comfortable. Their breakfast was a good start for the day (especially when I awoke to the lovely aroma of baking wild blueberry muffins). There was always pleasant conversation and Kit, Scott and Purcey were very personable and easygoing. It was very relaxed to stay there and the location was very convenient for spending time in Jamaica Plain or taking the T up into the City. If I make a return trip to JP I will be sure to check there first for availability.  Spring had not quite started when I arrived but the weather was very mild and its very apparent that the landscaping, the fishpond and the rest of the yard were getting ready to go green which would make the days there even more delightful."

The place is a short subway ride from downtown. Scott was there to welcome us when we arrived. The suite was much more than we expected - spacious, clean and well-maintained. No disturbances of any kind. Kit and Scott provided us with a wholesome organic breakfast everyday. We loved the muesli so much that we actually got the recipe from them.

The bedroom has skylight windows that open so that you are looking out on the treetops and allow for the moon to peek into the room at night.,,,,,

Located in a fantastic area within walking distance of many of the attractions on our list,Jason's Back Bay apartment exceeded all of our expectations.  It was clean,comfortable,and felt like a home away from home.,,
As for Jason,himself - he went out of his way to ensure that our stay was top-notch.  His dedication to a unique customer expereince really shines through and for us,"what really made the difference was the attention he paid to all the small details that most people take for granted. \"",,,

The 2 full bathrooms were a huge bonus for getting ready in the morning. Staying in this place for almost a week made us feel as if we were in a luxury apartment. Great restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance. We were at a conference at the Hynes and really appreciated how close we were to everything. Jason was the ideal host and even had a bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrival. He had great suggestions as to where to eat in the area and he was right on with all. The apartment was spotless and the beds super comfy. My son is going to college in the Fall in the Boston area and we will definitely make this our home base from now on.

Checking in and out was very easy. The Back Bay neighborhood is my favorite neighborhood in Boston and Jason’s condo is perfectly situated on a great residential street overlooking a wonderful park.  I was less than a five minute walk to the Hynes Convention Center, the numerous shops and restaurants on Newbury and Boylston Streets, and the bridge to MIT and Cambridge.  Also, Jason was very prompt in responding to any questions I had and very friendly.  I loved everything about this stay and will definitely be staying at Jason’s apartment next time I’m in town.

The condo is located in a gorgeous brownstone on a beautiful,tree-lined street facing a park.  The street is very quiet,except perhaps during rush hour.  Any Airbnb guest who tries to avoid more lived-in accommodations will appreciate how immaculate and beautifully decorated this house is.  The kitchen also is well equipped with new appliances,and is suitable for in-home cooking.,,
Access to the condo went without a hitch.  If you have a car,as we did,I suggest taking Jason up on his offer of an on-site parking space ($30/day).  Parking in the city is a hassle,so we parked in Jason's spot and took Uber the rest of the visit,with most rides being under $10.,
Jason is a very helpful host.  We communicated several times via text,and he was very responsive.  Had we had any issues,I am confident that he would have addressed them promptly.,,,

The location is very central and within walking distance  to everything you may need in Boston, including the beautiful parks. The only disadvantage to the apartment was that the dryer used to eat up our quarters occasionally!"
2277821,17695333,2014-08-16,5027483,Paul,"The Back Bay is a lovely, if not the best area to stay in."

2277821,20830048,2014-10-06,20464671,Kay,"This is a lovely apartment in a superb location in the Back Bay area. Loads of shops and restaurants on the doorstep and the Public Garden is just a short walk away through lovely streets. The apartment is immaculate and beautifully furnished, the free wifi was great and the TV had all the premium channels. Everything was new, clean and comfortable. It was so much nicer than staying in a hotel. Jason was a great host, very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Would certainly recommend it."
2277821,21073878,2014-10-11,18098299,Lynette,"Jason was an amazing host. We were greeted with local cookies and a bottle of wine, a list of convenient restaurants and attractions...all very nice touches. He even dropped off a hairdryer the night we arrived when I discovered I was without one."
The flat itself was gorgeous - fluffy towels and lovely furnishings. Location is spectacular - I can't imagine staying anywhere else.,,,,,

Jason met us on arrival, provided us with cookies and a bottle of wine and went out of his way to be helpful."
2277821,21759616,2014-10-23,16371749,Santiago,"Jason is a wonderful host. When we arrived he personally welcomed me and explained led me with a brief tour of the apartment and the building. The apartment's location cannot be better. Half block away from Boylston or Newbery Streets and a short walk to shoppings and transport system. Me and my family we felt very well in the apartment that can easily fit a 4 member family. The only shortcoming for a family is the lack or parking space if you come with a vehicle (very necessary with small children). Overall, it was a great stay. Definitely to recommend and to stay over again."
2277821,21956152,2014-10-27,1673517,Denise,Jason and his family were extraordinary hosts. I cannot imagine anything they would not have tried to do if we asked. They were remarkable and provided us such a gorgeous apartment for our weekend. Jason brought us goodies and wine. The location was perfect for all our needs. We cannot wait to return.

Upon arrival we were gifted with a bottle of wine & delicious cookies. Everything we wanted to know was ready and waiting for us in the welcome packet - very helpful indeed. The apartment is in a lovely location, right near Newbury Street and Jason was more than happy to share some night spots with us. The house is decorated in a wonderful manner and you truly feel home. Check out was very simple and they were kind enough to let us leave our bags in the office until our flight later that evening.  Our time in Boston for a girls weekend was brilliant and it was made all the more seamless and exciting thanks to the apartment and Jason's hospitality. We will most certainly be back upon our next visit to Boston."
2277821,22995825,2014-11-19,955852,Patrick,"Jason was fantastic - showed up after hours to let me and and made everything extremely easy. Beautiful, well kept apartment in one of the best locations in Boston...that felt like a home away from home!"

I've stayed in Boston 10+ times in the last two years and this was the best I've found on AirBnB.  This place is fully renovated and they've literally thought of everything.  Great kitchen,bathrooms and comfortable living room.,,,,

Prudential Center is right around the corner. Jason was very nice and helpful, always responding very quickly. The apartment was very clean and functional."
"The master bedroom with a window facing the Public Alley can be a bit noisy early morning with a garbage truck stopping  right under the window.\"",,,,,

2277821,25131641,2015-01-07,23252746,Daphne,"\"This was our first experience with airbnb and it couldn't have been better. We stayed for four nights while we were getting our daughter set up in her new home in Boston. Check-in was easy, and Jason was a welcoming and gracious host. The apartment is beautiful, very cozy and well equipped - so much nicer than a hotel room given the amount of stuff we had! The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms newly renovated with marble tile, and the heating worked great (much appreciated since we were in the middle of an \"\"arctic freeze\"\"). Little extras - like coffee pods"

I was provided with keys in the office downstairs and given information about the area. The apartment is absolutely beautiful - even more so in person. It was well stocked with everything we needed. The gorgeous furnishings, linens, etc gave us all the comforts of home. We were able to make several meals in (there are two grocery stores within walking distance) and had great dining out options nearby as well. The location could not  be more perfect to easily get around the city and see the sights. We took the train very easily from the Prudential Center (great shopping there by the way).  We will definitely stay here again."

Secondly,the host Jason was just terrific. He called to make sure we had everything we needed,and when we asked for more towels for instance,he dropped them into us within minutes. He couldn't have been more accommodating or helpful.,,

2277821,28310885,2015-03-22,8912492,Fridrik,We enjoyed Jason's hospitality and amazing service over a cold March weekend. Jason responded very quickly to our questions and concerns and the check-in / check-out was a breeze. The group thoroughly enjoyed the apartment and its amenities and the location is one of a kind. We will definitely stay with Jason again and recommend the place to anyone spending some time in downtown Boston.
2277821,28774764,2015-03-30,22826074,Winnifred,"Jason was fantastic. He made my first Airbnb experience so easy. He is prompt with responses, very organised with great house manual and was there the moment we had problem with Internet problem even though it was a Saturday night!(problem was actually due to the bad weather). The apartment is in central location in Back Bay, walking distance to many things - we even walked to the Freedom trail from here. Newbury street is close for shopping. The apartment has everything - and very clean. Would definitely stay here again."

Jason had a box of delicious cookies and a bottle of wine waiting for us.  The location is fabulous.  You are steps from Newbury and Boylston Street.  All of the best of Boston is walking distance from this fabulous apartment.  This is now the only place we want to stay when we come up to visit our kids that live in Boston and The New England area."

Beautiful apartment, excellent location right at Newbury Street for shopping, restaurants, etc.  We came as tourists for a long weekend with our 7 year old daughter, and were very happy."
One slight word of caution,the back bedroom faces an alleyway that has some noise with the garage truck at 5am,and glass noise at 3 am but this is not within the control of the host. If you are a light sleeper I would sleep in the other bedroom that is extremely quiet.,,,
"I would recommend this place to anyone with that in mind.\"",,,,,

The appartement is perfectly located and provides the ammenities of the best hotels in town. If you have to be in Boston for a few days with a larger group, this is THE place to rent. Highly recommended."
2277821,32676488,2015-05-20,15582094,Lisa,"The apartment was everything the description said it would be. Wonderfully located--right in between Newbury and Boylston Streets, both of which are wonderful shopping areas. We were in walking distance to shopping, restaurants, transportation, etc. The apartment itself is beautifully furnished with great attention to detail. The only drawback is the city noise at night time which one can hear--garbage trucks loading and unloading every night out the back bedroom, people shouting, etc. Definitely need earplugs. Other than that, we couldn't have been happier with it. We would stay here again."
"Jason was an excellent host. He checked in the first night to make sure we had everything we needed. He asked specifically about sheets for the air mattress and within 10 minutes had hand delivered them to us. If we had any other concerns we knew we could check with him or the management company downstairs and that it would be dealt with. Outstanding experience all the way around. \"",,,,,

The location is absolutely perfect - half a block away from everything. The unit was even more beautiful than the pictures. It was fully stocked with toilet paper, paper towels, coffee etc. Instructions provided were thorough with lots of recommendations for nearby restaurants and bars. Check in/check out was an absolute breeze. The best part of the experience was a 4 hour sailing trip that Jason arranged for us... it made for a trip we will never forget! I will definitely recommend this property and any others that Jason manages to friends and family. Thanks so much for the hospitality, Jason!"
2277821,39004281,2015-07-20,30029526,Angela,"Great apartment in the great location, it couldn't be better. We arrived late in the night and Jason did all necessary pre-arrangements and guided us by phone with a lot of patience, so that we easily found and entered the apartment. It is exactly as described, very light and convenient for a family of 4, we liked it very much. The location was ideal for us to walk in the city and to the Foo Fighters concert in Fenway.

Loved that we could easily and safely walk home from the game at Fenway.  We really felt more like locals than tourists.  The apartment is clean, comfortable, and stocked with all the needed amenities.  Jason was a great host.  He provided a nice welcome, checked in to ensure all was well, and provided some alternate ideas for outings when he thought our plans were changing due to the weather.  I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend this listing to others."
2277821,41187145,2015-08-05,23841121,Annicka,This apartment was just as the site and other reviews suggest. Beautifully decorated and in a great location. I stayed for two nights with my husband and three young children. Jason was an attentive and generous host.
Everything is very easy - from getting the keys,to finding the extra air bed for my child. The beds are comfy and the apartment has everything you need for a stay. It's a professional set up that I would highly recommend either for a family,"couple or individual when in Boston. \"",,,

The apartment has everything I needed: high-speed wireless, an iron, soft towels, shampoo and a very comfortable bed."
2277821,43893614,2015-08-23,3833523,Tak Steve,The apartment was steps away from the Hynes Convention center where we were attending an event.  It could not have been more convenient.  Jason recommended that we take the Logan Express from the airport which drops you off after just one stop for $5 per person.  we took it both ways and it was super convenient.
The apartment was up one flight of stairs and had all the charm of a boston brownstone.  The flat was well furnished and the well appointed throughout.  The beds were super comfortable and we were able to get a good nights rest.  The apartment was very clean and we were very satisfied.,,,,,
The neighborhood was very convenient to everything.  we walked out to some some terrific restaurants (le voile and the capital grill) just blocks away and had access to starbuck coffee two blocks away.  The grocery store just around the corner so we could get the staples we needed for breakfast and snacks.,,,,,
"we were a family of four with 2 adults and 2 teenage children and we had plenty of space and enjoyed our time immensely.  the only downside to the apartment is that the 2nd bedroom has no window so our  children had a hard time getting up in the morning ... but maybe that's also because they are teenagers.\"",,,,,
2277821,46269660,2015-09-09,33826387,Lorraine,"Our Host, and this wonderful Boston Apartment, was truly exceptional!  Our Host, Jason, actually met us at the apartment  upon our arrival; since it was a holiday weekend and the Realty office on the first floor was closed. He immediately made everyone feel welcome and excited to be there. He showed us around the property.  It is beautiful and the beds were very comfortable.  Excellent printed instructions regarding the property were on the kitchen island.  We could not have asked for a better location - and our host, Jason Post, was easily reachable for any questions.  The apartment was pristine, beautifully decorated, well appointed and close to everything worth seeing in Boston.  It is close to the MBTA (Subway), which we utilized along with UBER to get around town.  You can easily walk to Newbury Street for shopping and dining.  We even enjoyed a walk across the Charles River into Cambridge from the  apartment.  We found a lovely coffee shop extremely close by  where we enjoyed breakfast a few times.  Jason gave us excellent restaurant recommendations and made us feel extremely welcome.  He is definitely a Host that goes above and beyond expectations!  And upon our departure we used the Logan Express Shuttle at 900 Boylston to get to the airport.  A VERY short walk from the apartment. Could not have been more convenient.  If you love to be in the heart of everything - AND have luxury accomodations - this apartment provides it all!"

2277821,51881293,2015-10-25,31913705,Robin,"Our host checked in with us ahead of our trip to make sure we were set with logistics, checked in upon our arrival, and checked in after our stay, offering not only restaurant suggestions in the area, but also feedback on how long we should expect trips to take to some of our college visits.  Jason was very flexible in arranging for key pick as our flights arrived later than normal business hours.  The rental was clean, beautiful and well equipped, and the location was close to restaurants and activities that we had planned that weekend.  Was great to have a gathering spot during the day to be able to hang out and watch some football as a family.  We had an issue with noise in the back alley during the night,  but Jason was most receptive to feedback on that issue and will work to make the city aware of noise violations that occurred during our stay.  Hopefully will not be a problem in the future.  Other than that, a perfect stay."
2277821,53359545,2015-11-08,45698057,Katrina,"The listing description was very accurate and Jason was an excellent host. I think the the pictures don't do justice of how beautiful the apartment is. The apartment was very clean, beautifully furnished and located in very convenient location. The apartment was walking distance to a lot of restaurants, stores and attractions. Jason was very helpful in recommending restaurants around the area. When we arrived in the apartment, there was a bottle of wine that he left for us. That was a very nice touch. He was very responsive in all our communications and even allowed us to check in early at no extra charge. I think this apartment is the best place if you want to stay in a central area in Boston. My friends and I really enjoyed our stay in this apartment. We are so happy that we picked this place instead of staying in a hotel. I am now recommending Jason and all his listings to my family and friends if they plan to visit Boston in the future."

Jason was very helpful as our party was arriving at different times. We had an issue with the front door key late at night and Jason was immediately round to help and embarrassingly it was a simple problem.  The apartment is very well appointed and the pictures don't really do it justice. Brilliant location being close to the T, the Logan airport bus stop and lovely shopping area. Great place, would recommend  and stay again."
2277821,73988539,2016-05-12,29268717,佳琛,Mr. Jason is a very nice and patient person! His apartment is very very pretty! I and my parents enjoyed! Thank you very much!

2277821,76271897,2016-05-26,56555,Kyndall,"Jason was super responsive and made this stay very easy; easy for me to coordinate and easy on my colleagues who were staying in his unit. The lock box was clutch, allowing for check-in post a Red Sox game; check-out was super easy as well. The location was convenient and the space was comfortable and looked just like the pics!"
2277821,77977215,2016-06-04,22024188,Joel,"Jason is terrific--he remembered my preference for double-ply tp, and thoughtfully brought some when we returned this year.  He also brought us a bottle of wine and spent a lot of his valuable, limited time catching up with us."

2277821,89052865,2016-07-26,69814037,Lavon,"We are just back from our stay in Boston at Jason's place.  I am still BLOWN away as to how fantastic our stay was from start to finish!  Jason took time out to show up as we were checking in and made sure everything was to our liking.  This place is remarkable!  The pictures are spot on!  Location is right dab in the mix of what seems like hundreds of places to go and see.  Super clean and ultra comfortable!  If you are looking for a place to stay in the Boston area, you have to give Jason's place a great look!  I guarantee you will be more than satisfied with your stay!  Thank you Jason for making our first Airbnb experience one we'll share with friends over and over!"

2277821,91355890,2016-08-05,85385243,MichaelandKhris,"Jason under-promised and over-delivered – fantastic experience!  Rooms were impeccably clean and decorated – plenty of room for our family of five – felt like our home away from home.   Location was ideal – close to shopping, restaurants, grocery stores, historical district – we walked everywhere.  Complementary sailing tour of Boston's inner harbor with Jason's father, Larry, was a special bonus and a highlight of our trip."
2277821,93605844,2016-08-13,77126120,Paige,"Such a fantastic location! A beautiful apartment right where you want to be in Boston for shopping, restaurants etc! It's beautifully decorated but could do with a bit of a bigger sofa though we were out all the time so it wasn't a big deal for us really. Jason was super responsive and helpful, couldn't have asked for more in that regard."

7033732,44135323,2015-08-24,8904651,Sara,Hayley's flat is ideal for a local experience in Boston/East Boston. We wanted a view of the Boston skyline at night and some awesome local recommendations and she delivered! We enjoyed her recommendation for KO Meat Pies and appreciated her thoughtfulness in providing Charlie Cards for the T. We would go back in a heartbeat and recommend this location for others.
7033732,44944731,2015-08-30,38931516,Rose,"I spent the weekend at this apartment with a friend to finish off the summer. We had a fantastic time, and Hayley was an incredible host! She left us a list of places to eat as well as some other attractions, and was very friendly and helpful. The location is beautiful, in a nice neighborhood with plenty of places to eat and very close to the Boston harbor with lots of beautiful parks. I would absolutely stay here again!"
7033732,46716998,2015-09-13,34592866,John,"This ended up being such a great experience. We got there at night. We were a little nervous walking to this place late in the evening. However, once we saw the neighborhood in the daylight, we realized we had nothing to fear! Hayley's place is so charming and fun. It was one of our favorite spaces we've stayed in. It was so homey!"
7033732,47662688,2015-09-21,38560081,David,The host was very nice.  She let us arrive early and store our bags for a late check out since she had no one coming that day.
The building was older but showed the true colors of the area.,,,,,
Everything was clean.  You can walk a few blocks to eat at a variety of restaurants,little markets and bakery's.,,,,
"The \"\"T\"\" is only a few blocks away and it's an easy subway system to learn in only a few minutes.  I give it a thumbs up and would stay there again. Dave & Cathy\"",,,,,
7033732,48779917,2015-09-28,43307870,Katie,"Hayley was a great host.  We had great communication from the beginning.  The studio itself is extremely cute and makes you feel right at home.  I loved the vintage feel it had.  The location is just one T stop out of the city which made it very convenient to get to the main attractions, but at the same time makes your feel like a local.  The water is about a block a way and it felt extremely peaceful to look at the city from the east side while enjoying a pastry and coffee from the local Italian Bakery (which she recommended).  I definitely would recommend her studio, it is a great size and is in a perfect location."
7033732,49769808,2015-10-06,10990010,Courtenay,"Location was close to subway, cute area and Hayley was a great host.. Very helpful :)"
7033732,50750375,2015-10-14,35750074,Jane,Hayley's apartment was a great place to stay during our time in Boston!
Hayley was really good at keeping in touch with us before and during our stay,and made the whole process really easy for us - especially considering our plane arrived late one night into Boston. She also kindly left us recommendations for restaurants close by (the pizza place was great!) and left us Charlie cards to easily catch the subway around the city. The place itself was really clean and quite spacious for two people.,,,,
Thanks for being such a great host,"Hayley!\"",,,,
7033732,51273129,2015-10-19,1878291,Rukmini,Hayley was an excellent hostess. We absolutely loved her apartment. It was so comfortable and it felt like home. Very well kept and right in the heart of the city with the transit system right by it. This place was a great bonus to our trip.

7033732,54707998,2015-11-23,44075354,David,I stayed 4 nights in Hayley's apartment and it was a very good experience. Hayley is a fantastic host!  The unit is big and well located in Boston. The system for picking and giving back the keys is very convenient.

7033732,57135898,2015-12-22,48353582,Paul,"Hayley place was great and easy to find. The metro stop is just near her place. Even thought she unfortunately was not present ( it was christmas time) she left us very useful informations, adresses..."
7033732,58005075,2015-12-31,45865986,Jody,"This was the perfect place! Hayley made everything super easy from checking in and out to providing information about the city. My girlfriend and I were very comfortable and plan on staying here the same time next year! The price can't be beat, and the location is perfect for those flying in and out of the city. I definitely recommend it!"
7033732,58877840,2016-01-05,42849071,Jessica,Hayley was very accommodating with flexible check in times.  She contacted us by text message to assure us that everything was as it should be.  The apartment was all location.  It was exactly what we needed: just a place to crash between two days on museums!
7033732,59216785,2016-01-08,858638,Linda,The location of this apartment is so convenient to the airport and the T to get into boston.  Hayley is a very nice host and communicates well with her guests. She also suggested a great place to eat just down the street from her apartment.

7033732,61086186,2016-01-31,52642291,JoBeth,"Hayley was a great host!  I did not meet her personally because my flight arrived late Friday pm.  She answered all my questions and was readily available via text/call for anything I needed.  I even forgot my earbuds, and she let me borrow a pair of hers.  Cute little place, comfy & cozy.  The street was quiet and I felt safe in the neighborhood. I was traveling alone so that was a top concern of mine.  The apartment is a 5 minute walk to the Maverick T station which takes you downtown or to the airport.  Even when not taking the T, Lyft was an affordable option.  I highly recommend Hayley and am grateful she opened her home up to me."
7033732,61715300,2016-02-07,56782658,Regina,Hayley's studio was perfect and super cozy.

7033732,63875907,2016-02-28,50195117,Eeron,Hayley is the sweetest and kindest host you'd ever meet. She made all the procedures and instructions very clear for us which made our arrival very smooth. She gave us a lot of tips for the places of interest and meals.
The apartment was cozy,it feels like home and it is a convenient place,just a 5 mins walk from the train station. It has most of the amenities a traveler will need. It looks much better than it appears on the pictures. Love the place,"I would book it again if I were to travel to the same place once more. \"",,

7033732,66035874,2016-03-19,53838995,Robert,Her place was as described closed to the T (subway) and closed to the airport so you don't have to take a cab. It was clean and beds were comfortable. Her welcome letter was helpful with thing to do and places to eat. Would stay there again if in Boston
7033732,66682613,2016-03-24,47225022,Shannon,"It was mine and my husbands first time in Boston so we really had no idea what area we wanted to stay in. I chose this place based on reviews and I'm glad we did. The neighborhood was off the beaten path and nice and quiet. It's a little walk to get to anything but we managed just fine, even in the snow! The apartment itself is very eclectic and cozy. We looked it up and it's almost 100 years old which we both found super cool! I recommend this place to anyone who is easy going and isn't concerned with fancy details."
7033732,67404950,2016-03-29,53980318,Tara,Hayley's place was wonderful! It looks exactly like it does in the photos...cute and quaint! My boyfriend and I were visiting from out of town and stayed for a few nights. Hayley met us when we arrived to answer any questions we had and provided us with useful information. She even wrote down some great restaurants/bars to visit. This was our first Airbnb experience and it definitely was a great one. I highly recommend staying at Hayley's studio if you're visiting Boston.
7033732,68304435,2016-04-04,53148767,Marissa,We had a lovely time staying in Hayley's studio--it was a charming and cozy place that was easy to get to by cab or from the T. Hayley was very kind and quick to respond via text (which was good when we were confused about checking out!) and also gave us a list of recommendations for places to sightsee and eat. It was a great experience overall!
7033732,69940573,2016-04-14,13584395,Beverly,"Hayley's studio was perfect for our trip to Boston.  The location is fabulous with a short walk to the T.

Will stay again if in area!"
7033732,70728291,2016-04-20,52718214,Kendal,"Haley greeted us at the studio apartment and gave us some tips for things to do, see, and eat. The accommodations were perfect for our home base needs. It had the feeling of staying over at a friends house. We felt safe walking three blocks to the T subway at all hours of day and night. We felt immersed in the Boston culture in this neighborhood in a way staying at a hotel could never provide."
7033732,71170362,2016-04-24,53201729,Nathan,"The trip was fantastic, Hayley left a great list of bars and eateries to visit. Highly recommend the KO pies,meat pies place, freakin amazing.

Location was great after a long flight across the Atlantic (make sure the taxi driver knows it's Sumner St and not \"\"SUMMER St\"\" like my British accent suggested because we ended up with a tour of the city haha). Would happily visit again and would recommend this little gem to anybody. \""
7033732,74023581,2016-05-12,22904100,Christina,Hayley was the perfect host. The Apartment is lovely and close to the subway which can get you anywhere you need to go quickly. When I arrived there were fresh flowers and great instructions for getting around and eating. Loved my stay.
7033732,74317634,2016-05-14,57093437,Kyoko,"Hayley's place was perfect for us to stay overnight, and back to the airport the next day. We had a little less than 24 hours in East Boston, and we got to see the beautiful skyline from the Pier park, had amazing Mexican food for dinner, and Aussie pies for brunch the next day, all on Hayley's recommendation notes!"
Hayley was very flexible with check-in and check-out times,"and easy to communicate. \"",,,,

7033732,75929141,2016-05-23,462519,Syb,"Hayley was responsive to all my inquiries and helpful in finding street parking. We chose her apartment because we had an early morning flight and wanted to be close to the airport to return our rental car. We were pleased that the apartment was comfortable, well located near public transportation, close to parks with great views of downtown Boston, and very close to the airport car rental places."
7033732,76670111,2016-05-28,5228083,Kelly,"Hayley was a fantastic communicator - even answering a message in the early morning hours when we arrived later than expected due to flight delays.  Though we were only at Hayley's for a short period of time, it worked perfect being so close to the airport.  We enjoyed exploring East Boston by foot before heading out for the Berkshires."
7033732,77822901,2016-06-03,45912049,Ryan,"Staying at this studio was absolutely wonderful! Everything was as described and the host was incredibly accommodating and super awesome! If my wife and I are ever back in Boston, we know where to go!"

7033732,79214568,2016-06-11,60494729,James,Hayley gave us very good instructions about what was available in the cute East Boston  neighborhood. The neighborhood is what you would imagine it would be with a blended variety of people. We enjoyed a meal from the Pizzeria just down the street as well. The accommodations were just as advertised. Parking is a little challenging for a small town guy like myself.  Access to downtown and the rest of Boston is made much easier with the Maverick subway stop just down the street.
7033732,81062518,2016-06-20,29325173,Charles,"My son and I spent 5 nights here over Father's Day weekend and had a great time! Hayley was a great host and all communication with her was always prompt. This is a great location in East Boston close to airport, but not noisy and subway is just 5-10 walk away, which opens a gateway to anywhere in Boston.  The neighborhood is  very diverse, but the locals were friendly. We did all of Hayley's suggested local places and she was right on! She even gave us lots of other specific advice about things to do while in Boston. The accommodations are nice, larger than a hotel room and much more reasonable in price."
7033732,82173537,2016-06-26,60940946,Robby,Hayley was a great host and gave us some very helpful suggestions on where to eat and places to visit.

Tge Italian Bakery in the neighborhood was wonderful and I wish we'd tried the Pakistani/Indian restaurant as well. It was fun to walk down to the docks located nearby to see the beautiful lights of Boston at night. The neighborhood felt very safe. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in East Boston at Hayley's. I wish we'd been able to stay longer. The only downside was the bloody heat outside, which of course had nothing to do with out host. Next time I'll return in the spring or fall."

First of all the studio is the cutest ever, we loved how small and cozy it was. The location is perfect because it's only a stop away from the aquarium and Quincy market. Also I loved how close to the piers it is, definitely visit the piers because the view is AMAZING. Overall we loved our time in Boston and would recommend her place to anyone visiting Boston."

Jay has been a good host, he responded to our questions, it was cool to talk with him in the backyard when we arrived after our day. It was our first time with Airbnb and we have loved our experience. For sure when we come back in Boston, we will try to stay at Jays house."
"Thanks Jay!\"",,,,,
8172380,48938030,2015-09-29,40031366,Uwe,"Grosses, gemütliches Zimmer mit riesigem Fernseher und viel Schrank-Platz. Der Gastgeber ist zuvorkommend und immer gut drauf. Allerdings muss man sich der Distanz zur Stadt doch bewusst sein, wir haben 40min zu Fuss gebraucht. Metro sollte allerdings kein Problem sein. Das Bad wird mit dem Rest der Gäste geteilt, wird aber sauber gehalten."
8172380,49694431,2015-10-05,44667567,Eva,"I received a warm welcome even though I arrived shortly before midnight.  Place is a clean home, Jay is very welcoming.  He toured me around and was generally very friendly and straightforward.  Place is as described in the listing in terms of what's available.  It's 10-15 min to Mass Av/Boylston.  The whole house has six other AirBnB rooms, two bathrooms to share but all clean.  Great value for money.  Great character house."
8172380,50684414,2015-10-13,45100997,Scott,House was cozy and host was very warm and welcoming.  Made us feel at home and was quick to reply to all questions and concerns.  With this being our first time with AirBnB we were a bit apprehensive and Jay made us feel very comfortable.  Thanks and best of luck.
"Greatly enjoyed the wine and conversation!\"",,,,,

They even put me in an uber to help me get to my performance in time. The place was clean, peaceful, and well stocked with toiletries and snacks. It's also a few minutes walking distance from both bus and trains. I enjoyed my stay and will likely stay again in the future."

8172380,52133429,2015-10-26,10137367,Cindy,"The accomodation was as pictured & detailed.  Jay runs the house soley for Air BnB, therefore it runs very similar to a hostel.  The common areas were clean. Jay was customer orientated. We had a small problem with heating however Jay had already arranged trade to fix immediately & provided back up solutions."
The only item I would suggest to improve is the bed & pillows which we found uncomfortable.,,,,,

Easy street parking (just check the signs for street cleaning). Bed and pillows were very comfortable. Plenty of closet space and hangers. There are locks on the individual room door so I felt everything was secure. The bathroom had great shower pressure and no trouble sharing with others in the morning. Wireless worked great. Only word of wisdom was the noise level of an older creaky house and the street noise, but as it was my first stay in that area of Boston maybe I should have expected it. Thanks for a nice place to stay. definitely will consider staying here again for the value."

Easy to park on the side streets just make sure your aware of Monday and Wednesday street cleaning and you'll be fine! Donovan has multiple rooms and I'll definitely be staying with him whenever I get back to Boston! There is an AmazonFire which I used to Netflix and that was a great plus especially because I wanted to just watch some TV when I got there! All of Donovan's instructions were easy and simple and made my stay incredible. Definitely a great experience thank you so much!

A second code was sent but again it didn't work. I was luck enough to bump into Arron leaving the property and he was most helpful. There was no room key, so Arron contacted Donovan and he arrived within 20 minutes with the key and was very helpful. From there on it was plain sailing. The location is good with easy access to the Orange line and the room was clean with good bathroom facilities."

After booking I was sent information on the locks of the house and how I could access my room. I was working 14-16 hour days in the area so I didn't arrive until midnight and would leave by 8AM every morning. I know others were staying in the house but I did not meet them. The area was decent. The room was clean and well managed and the windows were open when I arrived. This isn't a resort and the room wasn't perfect (broken closet door, bed could use work etc) but for a place to sleep and eat while wandering the city? You can't beat it.  My check in and out was incredibly simple and the showers in this house were absolutely amazing. I would 100% stay here again."

For the price,our host provided everything we could need. Though it was chilly outside,for someone from the south,we were never cold. The shared restrooms had the amenities and if you wished to cook,the kitchen looked well stocked. Our room had a huge TV we weren't expecting but if we wanted to lay down and watch,"it was a nice touch. I was completely satisfied with the accommodations.\""

Everything was decently clean and comfortable. SP was friendly and responded quickly. The neighborhood was decent as well and there were no real problems there. While no Hilton, you cannot beat this price and location and for that I give this place a good rating."

For two nights ok but a bit weird since we came from another city with a host who took great care of us and was always around when needed. Here you just have other airbnb roommates in the house you never see but always hear.,,,,,
Nevertheless the room was huge,clean and had a huge TV.,,,,

8172380,77279901,2016-05-31,70245218,Badeel,This was one of my worst experiences on Air BnB so far. This place is located in downtown however the street itself was somewhere I would not be comfortable staying at.
We were greeted at the hallway by another guest who was shirtless,"was cursing on the top of his breat and was accompanied by a woman who looked like she was high. The bathroom did not have basic amenities such as liquid handsoap and shampoo. The room itself was generally clean but had a terrible mattress with two flimsy pillows that were not comfortable at all. The room had a TV that did not work and since we were sharing the bathroom and it was right outside our door we could basically hear people going to use the facilities as the door to our room was also pretty flimsy.\"",,,,

The pluses were the location - 3 minutes to the Roxbury Crossing T stop on the orange line, and free on-street parking. The room was clean, and looked as pictured. Disappointments were two thin pillows (and no extra ones in the closet) as well as a soft mattress, and the upstairs bathroom had nothing more than liquid handsoap. The house is older and not glamorous but certainly serviceable. For the location and the price I can see the popularity of this residence."

Upon arrival the host wasn't there but I knew everything I had to do and spoke to an advocate for the host 30 minutes before my arrival. It's a cute house.  I actually didn't realize how many room it had until all the keys were gone.  The kitchen is spacious and available to us for use.  No one touched my things in it.  I did use tongs for the ice and a cup for my Jameson.  Both items I got from the cupboards and drawers but they both were dirty. Dish soap is available on sight. 2 bathrooms, pretty clean. Extra tissue for refilling is available, as is spray and shower cleaner under the sink!  The room was as pictured. When I got in it was overpowered with the smell of Lysol.  The air conditioner helped get rid of the Lysol smell fast! The bed is broken and not the mosssst comfortable thing in the world  but I didn't expect much. I would have liked the \"\"cleaning\"\" person to have washed the top sheet. It did not smell like fresh laundry AT ALL. AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A WASHING MACHINE ON SIGHT I shouldn't have to wash the cups"
I did enjoy my stay here,aside from the slight hiccups! I would come back in hopes that the cleaning person steps their game up because everything was awesome.  The location is great!! Dark at night like the other reviews state but very close to the train station!,,,,
There's a Dominos and Dunkin Donuts for those not interested in the restaurant downstairs from the apartment.  If you walk about 10 minutes in the direction of Dunkin Donuts(toward Wigglesworth) you will see shops,bars,Drugstore,7 Eleven,another Dunkin,restaurants

The owner even allowed us to keep our bags in the house for a bit longer than the checkout time and come back for them later, because our departure out of Boston was later that night. Would definitely stay again."
8172380,92888046,2016-08-10,6547692,David,Everything was like on the pictures. Other guests were quiet and respectful. We appreciated the simplicity of the check in/out system. The location is also really convenient.

8172380,95646362,2016-08-20,46645647,Mayur,"This is a house converted into rooms for rent. The host was very professional in explaining the process of geting in, even though he/she wasn't present. Everything was as shown in the pictures."
8172380,97020591,2016-08-25,89837079,Barbara,"Il quartiere non sembrava molto sicuro e il letto sul pavimento irregolare ha reso il sonno molto difficile. Non era chiaro cosa potevamo usare in bagno (sapone, shampoo).  Il condizionatore era estremamente rumoroso e le finestre non si aprivano. Unica nota positiva: la metropolitana era però vicina all'alloggio."

"I would definitely stay again!!\"",,,,,
8172380,99787433,2016-09-05,90328427,Debbie,"The easy accessibility of the home was nice in terms of location (only a block away from the Orange Line) as well as the check in process, with door codes and no need for complicated key exchanges with the home-owner.  The quality of the house was not of the highest level, nor were the amenities, but if you do not plan on spending much time at the house other than sleeping, then it was an acceptable place to stay.  The bathroom floor was constantly wet since there no rugs in the bathroom outside the showers.  I would also suggest bringing your own towel if possible.  The neighborhood around the house felt safe and parking outside of the house was convenient.  Overall, it was a relatively pleasant experience."
8303267,81073857,2016-06-20,1705041,Brittney,Lisa was very easy to communicate with and made our check in and out simple. Her home is gorgeous with high-end furnishings and features like Sonos music and a nespresso machine. We LOVED staying in this neighborhood.

6646604,37995311,2015-07-12,23628797,Troy,The apt was perfect for my needs and the bed very comfortable.  It's located right between 2 of the green T lines and the neighborhood has lots of good restaurants and bars.  Kama was a delight to work with and very concerned about making sure I had everything I needed.  I would definitely rent from her again in the future.
6646604,40392759,2015-07-30,13823442,Kate,This apartment was clean and the bed comfortable. Communication was good between Kama and her assistant.
It does not have a microwave.  Wi-Fi is easy to connect. Very,,,,,
quiet building and it does have an elevator,since it's on the 4th floor (top floor,so no one is above you),,,
I didn't mind the stairs at all.  The neighborhood is lovely there are Eateries & Starbuck's a few blocks up on Beacon St. The T is right there too for easy commute downtown.,,,,,
I would stay here again,"the host was so nice to accommodate my check in and check out times. Thumbs Up!\"",,,,
6646604,40933168,2015-08-03,35950957,Ann,"Kama wants guests at 90 Kilsyth to have a banner experience.  The location is superb - close to B & C Green lines in a lovely, walkable Boston neighborhood.  Parking instructions for Out-of-Towners (especially West Coast people like me) needs to be specific, include best arrival time, and Kama will now provide this crucial info.  The apartment is a great value - kitchen and bathroom spaces are small, but updated (kitchen) and satisfactory (bath).  The bedroom is large and light-filled, rooftop deck & free wifi were fabulous, but the most welcome feature in July and August was the AC in the living room and bedroom (thank you!).  One of the host's best hospitality strategies is her ultra helpful assistant, Susan."
6646604,42681747,2015-08-15,34643492,Emma,We stayed here for 12 days in August. The place was generally comfortable and well-located (~10 mins walk from three different T lines). We had some problems with amenities when we first moved in (bathtub wouldn't drain and stove wasn't working) which for various reasons took several days to fix. However Kama offered us compensation  in the form of a partial refund. I suspect that these problems are unlikely to arise again now that they've been dealt with.

When I had questions about the parking in the neighborhood, Kama responded immediately. There was also a coffee maker, coffee, and sugar, what more could you ask for? Highly recommended."

6646604,50089217,2015-10-09,21923682,Darlynn,This was an ideal location for Boston College.  The neighborhood is quiet.  Cleveland Circle and Washington Square are easy walks and BC is three train stops away.  The apartment is a good size and provided a great place to be between activities.  The apartment is well equipped.   We cooked a couple of simple meals and took advantage of leftovers.  Would absolutely stay again.
6646604,51135488,2015-10-18,9790615,Kaya,The apartment is ideally located in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to the T and many restaurants. The proximity to Chestnut Hill Reservoir is awesome.

The neighborhood is great--it's quiet, but there are lots of interesting places to eat within easy walking distance.  Public transportation is close and easy.  On-street parking in the area is tight and only available a couple of blocks from the apartment."
"Kama was helpful and was able to accommodate an early check-in.\"",,,,,
6646604,67877327,2016-04-01,13603876,Beth,"The best thing about staying in this Airbnb hosted by Kama was the privacy.  I make numerous trips to Boston and staying in the apartment felt like it was my personal home base.  Kama ensured the key was accessible since she wasn't able to meet me due to snowy weather.  That said, it may not be the best unit for first time travelers to Boston.  While Kama was reachable, the response time was generally 2-12+ hours...ok for me, but might not be ideal for someone wanting more personal attention or local travel advice.  The oven door was broken while we were there and it made cooking in the unit much more challenging.  We also weren't able to get the tv functional with good reception, but didn't ask for assistance so it may have attributed to user error.  :)  Overall, very clean and nice one bedroom unit.  Good privacy and secure building.  Very convenient (within one mile) to the Green B,C and D lines.  Whole Foods within easy walking distance - wonderful!  Great to have the whole unit to ourselves.  Definitely will look to book again on future trips to Boston!"
6646604,69694462,2016-04-12,45130326,Tamsin,"Kama made us very welcome, she provided plenty of information about arriving and checked in on us by text periodically.

Kama left water and snacks, as well as a binder of information with restaurant suggestions. The building was quiet at night, and the bed was comfortable.

6646604,73689150,2016-05-09,58508827,Peggy,"This is an older apartment, as is true of most of the neighborhood.  However it was very clean and comfortable. We appreciated its nearness to public transportation and places to eat. Our host kept in touch with us via Airbnb text messaging and was very responsive. We will definitely book again, because we are so glad to have something in this particular neighborhood that is clean, comfortable, and affordable."

It is located in a nice neighborhood and a short walk to the T.  It offered the conveniences of a motel, as well as the privacy we were hoping for. We enjoyed our stay."
6646604,76229925,2016-05-25,54547601,GayLeen,"Kama was very accommodating since our flight was cancelled and we landed later then expected.

The apartment itself is well maintained and Kama makes things even better with small amenities like a welcome tray with water and a couple of snacks. The house has everything she listed. The building this apartment is in is a bit older than expected but this is not uncommon in Boston either. Overall I would recommend this place.,,,,,

It is on the 4th floor and the elevator is quaint at best -  not acceptable from the first floor.  You have to star in the second floor or higher.

6646604,92406032,2016-08-08,83271852,Eddie,The place here is great and in a great location. We came in for concerts at Fenway Park and it was a quick $8 - $12 Uber ride to the ball park. The roof deck is also a nice amenity to go up and relax on. The place is clean and the neighborhood is safe and quite.

There are 2 flights of steep stairs so be prepared to get a workout to the apartment but that seems to be the case for many apartments in Boston.  The apartment was very close to some great places to eat which made our stay more enjoyable.  We visited Cafe Madeline for french pastries in the morning.  They also have great cookies for a nice snack during your day out.  Also The Five Horses Tavern was a good pub for dinner.  Both within 2 blocks of the apartment.  Communication was also good.  There was some trouble with the cable but it seemed to fix itself."
12916551,99669275,2016-09-05,9931356,Alan,Nice apartment in good shape and well located. Parking is a plus!
6862758,36475843,2015-06-28,4161623,Chenyang,Most artistic home I've seen on Airbnb with many great paintings and little awesome details. Spacious living room and cosy sofas ideal for a party if you have more friends nearby. Very convenient to subway.
6862758,37242454,2015-07-05,23255345,Stephen,This was our first time using Air BNB and it was better than anything we could have expected. Our host was vey accommodating about us checking in early since we were traveling thru the night. The condo was in a great neighborhood and the pictures didn't do it justice. Zach provided detailed instructions that made our stay hassle free and very enjoyable. When we return to Boston in the future we will try and use them again for sure.
6862758,39828886,2015-07-26,7097912,Tasha,"Everything was clean, neat and the facilities within the condo were all easy to use. The space was HUGE and provided an excellent neighborhood experience that was quiet enough to feel outside of the city but getting into downtown was easy and fast."
"Zack was an excellent host - provided ample information about the place and the neighborhood. I would highly recommend to anyone!\"",,,,,
6862758,44320116,2015-08-25,15320059,Dany,"The apartment is fantastic.  It is spacious, nicely decorated, very clean and comfortable. It is located in a charming neighbourhood few minutes walking distance from the closest train station which brings you in Boston city centre in less than 15 minutes. Free parking on the street is very convenient if you travel by car. Zack provided well detailed walk around instructions on the apartment upon our arrival and was available to respond to our requests prior and during our stay. I highly recommend."
6862758,50307612,2015-10-11,11586746,Jennifer,Zack was very helpful and easy to deal with.

6862758,57606629,2015-12-27,50920538,Celeste,Our stay at Zack's lovely home was fantastic.   The photos on the Airbnb  site give an accurate representation of what the space looks like.  The condo was clean and well appointed.   The location was convenient and free parking in front was a definite plus!  Zack left clear instructions for sharing his home which we appreciated.   We hope all of our Airbnb experiences are this pleasant.
6862758,60058989,2016-01-18,46984940,Niles,"Zack communicated with us at several points beforehand, so we arrived with confidence in the arrangements.  I was traveling with my sister, and we both loved the apartment;  spacious and comfortable, neat but with some personality.  The many windows make it bright and cheerful, and we enjoyed seeing ice skaters across the way.  There were basic staples in the well-appointed kitchen and the two bedrooms are separated and really afford privacy.  Parking was available on the street and Jamaica Plain was a fun neighborhood.  I have no hesitation recommending a stay at Zack's.  You'll love it!"
6862758,74441028,2016-05-15,6636516,Michael,Everything was in order.  Apartment was larger and more beautiful than the pictures could show.  Parking was available on the street in front of the apartment all weekend.  Everything was EXACTLY as described or better.  Zack checked in with me to make sure things were going well after I checked in.  House rules were friendly and clear.  I hope  Zack's apartment will be available the next time I am visiting Boston.
6862758,77052960,2016-05-30,2819188,Randy &  Rebecca,Beautiful place. Excellent communication and attention to detail that made our stay just perfect. The apartment is just as great as it looks in the photos and very spacious and light filled. Jamaica Plain is a great area and you are close to lots of fantastic places to eat. Highly recommended.
6862758,84088057,2016-07-05,7729530,Evan,Our stay at Zack's place was perfect. Wonderful space and amenities. Everything was clean and comfortable. Our host was always available if we had questions.  A must stay in the Boston area. Many thanks for making our trip so enjoyable.

Parking was available on site for my rental car, but the on site parking management company could not offer me any short term parking that was better than the public rates--which were $40 per day with no in and out access.  Bottom line, the apartment was great, the location is great, but don't bring your car."

3914363,62696466,2016-02-16,50332908,Danitza,"Hi! I stayed in Mike'e apartment for almost 1month and a half. It's very comfortable and has everything you need. Great neighborhood and location, near the Longwood Medical Area (the shuttle passes just in front of the building) and a 20-30min walk from Newbury st/Copley square. People who worked at the reception were very nice and helpful always. It's part of the Fenway Trilogy, there are 3 buildings all connected by the 2nd floor (where you can find a gym, study center, tv and a billiard table). This was pretty cool because when it was very cold outside, and I didn't want to walk that much to the groceries or wherever I could go out by the nearest door. I would definitely stay there again!"
7931882,50383575,2015-10-11,45683182,Catherine,"Wonderful location a 3 minute walk from Boston Common and the end of Newbury Street, but on a quiet, pretty side street. A quick walk to awesome restaurants in the beautiful South End as well. The apartment is clean and Nick was very accommodating of our schedule! It's a 5th floor walk up, but very spacious. Great location, great apartment, great host!"
7931882,51999691,2015-10-25,38479430,Laura,"I had a great experience at this place! The apartment was cozy and clean. The neighborhood was nice, near to various places to eat, and close to the T. Also a short cab ride to downtown Boston. Nick was very responsive, and always got back to me quickly with any questions I had. I would definitely recommend the place!"

No problem with Internet. Nick is a kind host, we really felt welcome in his apartment. He was also very helpful in providing us information about the neighbourhood. He even made sure  that everything was fine during our stay. I strongly recommend this location."
7931882,53421883,2015-11-08,28551693,Laura,Nick was an excellent host. He was accommodating with our check-in and the apartment was so comfy for our visit!

Nick was very responsive to our questions before we got there and was waiting outside when we arrived.   The place was extremely clean and we appreciated his concern that everything was to our satisfaction.  We would recommend Nick's place without any reservations."

It turned out to be larger than we thought - very nice layout that separates the living space from the bedrooms - we were able to put our little son to bed and still comfortably spend time in the living room without waking him. It's also probably the cleanest airbnb place we ever stayed at. All the details are just perfect - nice bed linens, soft towels, ice cold water in the fridge. Nick is very communicative and is always just a quick message away. And the location was great for us - quiet street that does not wake you up at night but within a very short walking distance to the Common and Public Gardens. The T stop is also very close. We had a great weekend stay at Nick's!"
7931882,91723268,2016-08-06,21787875,Steve,"Nick was a wonderful host – hospitable, welcoming, and cordial. He went out of his way to make the apartment a lovely place to stay and feel at home."
The apartment itself is quite nice – a roomy two-bedroom with a nice living space. It is nicely air-conditioned,and comfortable. Yes,it is a fifth floor walk-up,though that was not a concern for me (and when I got there Nick even helped bring my luggage up!). And the location is perfect! Bay Village is nicely central in Boston,perfectly located between Back Bay,Chinatown
"Simply wonderful!\"",,,,,
7931882,97764091,2016-08-28,13459953,Ben,"Great location, great unit. We were two couples that stayed here comfortably. You're very close to the Commons/Park but you're removed enough in a quiet neighborhood. I would recommend."
2126053,11735462,2014-04-14,1513228,Celine,"The apartment was very well-located, practical and so pleasurable to live. Janet is helpful, available and friendly. If i had to come back to Boston, I would surely stay at Janet's apartment. I would recommand this apartment to anyone."
2126053,12581457,2014-05-05,13408828,Pablo,"We had a very pleasant stay in Janet's place. We actually stayed in a different appartement (due to a last minute problem, the studio listed wasn't available and Janet offered us to stay in another studio she reserves for her guests). The studio was in the same building and we found it  even cozier that the one we see in the pictures. All in all, we were very satisfied with the solution and we appreciated Janet's reliability. Janet provided us with everything we might need during our stay."
The appartement is situated in a lovely street in the most charming neighborhood in Boston,Beacon hill. The building is in a little street with almost no traffic so there is no noise during the night (or during the day). It is an extremely convenient location: next to the park of commons (perfect for a morning run),the subway red line is a few blocks away and all the interesting areas can be reached by walking (we just took the metro twice during our stay). There are bars,coffee-shops,supermarkets,restaurants... just round the corner.
Arriving to he apartment was easy,just as it was checking-in and -out . Janet was waiting for us at our arrival and she made sure we had everything we needed. She even reserved us little surprises (chocolates hidden in the room) and provided us with maps and guides of the city.,,,,

2126053,14201959,2014-06-14,15200048,Kevin,"Had a very nice stay at the apartment. It was as described in the posting and was professionally cleaned prior to my arrival. The apartment is conveniently located on a quiet street in charming Beacon Hill and is walking distance to the subway (Charles/MGH station), 24hr CVS pharmacy, Boston Common, and other shops and restaurants in the area. Janet was a very accommodating host and made arrangements to ensure that I received my keys at check-in. Overall, I would recommend the apartment for single travelers on short term visits."
2126053,16039831,2014-07-20,17940227,Mary,"I had a fantastic stay at Janet's place. The apartment was exactly as described, and very comfortable. The location couldn't be better-- right near the park on a lovey quiet street, and a 5ish min. walk to the T. The staircase up and the bathroom are tight, but what you would expect in old Boston. The kitchenette and writing table made it better for me than a hotel. I would definitely come back."

The air conditioning was a bonus as it was very warm during our stay. Janet is a charming host a lovely quiet but friendly person who is most willing to help if needed. We really enjoyed our chats with her and wish we had seen more of her during our stay. A great trip all round Janet is a great host, her apartment is in the most beautiful part of Boston with a great community feel and we can't wait to visit again."

Die Lage ist super in einem wunderschönen Viertel nahe dem Park und viele interessante Punkte in Boston sind zu Fuß erreichbar. Janet ist eine sehr angenehme Gastgeberin. Sie ist hilfsbereit und dabei zurückhaltend. Ich würde auf jeden Fall wiederkommen.
2126053,28712416,2015-03-29,27589718,Jason,What a great option for visitors to Boston looking to avoid an impersonal hotel! The studio was clean and bright and quiet and Janet was a delight to work with - very prompt responses and very accommodating to our needs. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quiet spot for themselves in a great area of town.
2126053,29672609,2015-04-11,28383359,Fatima,"Nous sommes ravis de notre séjour à Boston, l'emplacement de notre logement était juste parfait, nous avons pu faire beaucoup de choses à pied et découvrir le merveilleux quartier de Beacon Hill."

I stayed for a week,and had everything I needed to make me feel at home. I used the little kitchen quite a bit during my stay,which was very convenient.,,,
The studio is in a great location,numerous restaurants,shops,markets,and transportation options are all within walking distance. A great place to stay,whether you're coming to Boston for business or pleasure.
"Thanks Janet!\"",,,,,
2126053,33800337,2015-06-01,14207235,Kathryn,My husband and I loved staying at Janet's place.
The apartment was clean and as described,and there is an AC window unit for steamy Boston days. The little kitchenette can be concealed behind sliding doors. The space is quite small (there is one small sitting chair,in addition to what is pictured online),and the shower is tiny. However,there's plenty of closet space and it's certainly sufficient for a visit. The location and price definitely make up for the petite size :),
The building is a lovely brownstone in a beautiful neighborhood-- it's a fabulous location (there's a Peet's around the corner,as well as Tatte bakery-- amazing for breakfast or lunch!!)-- super urban but quiet feeling and a close walk to the T. The studio is a unit on the third floor of the building,which is otherwise occupied by other renters and Janet.,,,
We would love to stay there again,"and thanks to Janet for everything. \"",,,,

The address is in a very convenient location, near the Boston Garden. The room had all the amenities that I could have wished for. The host was very accommodating."

2126053,41221232,2015-08-05,9337144,Brigitta,"Janet's studio on beacon hill was perfect for our needs and for us a great pick. Moderately comfortable full size bed, mini kitchenette, wifi, and most importantly location, location, location. The stairs up to the studio are very narrow and steep so be aware of you don't like stairs. Additionally it is very spartan - I.e. Clearly no one actually ever lives here so Don't expect any extra soap or coffee to be laying around - there's literally a mini fridge, a mini microwave and four spoons, knives, forks and glasses - that is it. Despite some of those creature comforts some may like, It is three blocks to the red line or three blocks to the commons/garden and VERY clean so for us it was perfect."
2126053,46596649,2015-09-12,17204964,Catherine,"Nous avons passé un agréable séjour dans le Studio de Janet. Il était exactement tel que décrit. Le lit était un peu trop dur et inconfortable, mais c'est une question de goût. Sinon c'était très bien situé, facile d'accès, et très tranquille.  Je le recommande pour toute personne ou couple désirant séjourner à Boston."
2126053,47203498,2015-09-16,35512619,Pablo,"La ubicación es muy buena; son sólo dos pisos de escalera. El departamento está impecable. La información y artículos útiles provistos hacen que el lugar sea muy acogedor. Si bien cuenta con dos ventanas, el departamento no es muy luminoso. No conocimos a Janet, pero las indicaciones mencionadas nos permitieron manejarnos cómodamente. Muy lindo detalle los chocolates de bienvenida."
2126053,47959206,2015-09-22,7260527,Louis-Pierre,"Janet was very easy to communicate with. She gave me very detailed information to get to the apartment and the apartment had instruction to operate everything (TV, WIFI and other) The location is great with plenty of little restaurant and shops around yet on a very quiet street. Thank God for the AC next to the bed since Boston was having a hot septembre week. I would maybe point out that the apartment is on the second floor and those spiral stairs maybe an issue if you aren't the most fit. The pictures are pretty representative of the apartment though the apartment felt slightly smaller than on the pictures."
2126053,48785348,2015-09-28,6545683,Mo,"Everything was great!! Thanks Janet for our wonderful stay! They Studio was bigger than expected and had everything we needed. Furthermore, the location is amazing! There are many great restaurants on Charles Street and Boston Common is just a short walk away! I'd definitely recommend staying at Janet's place!"
2126053,49419389,2015-10-04,27962580,Katie,"Janet  provided us excellent directions on how to get to the apartment easily and free using public transportation from the airport.  We were able to access the apartment via the lockbox and Janet greeted us shortly after. Like others have said, the spiral staircase is a chore to navigate when you have luggage. But once it's up there, you don't have to worry about it again until it's time to check out. It's on the 3rd floor so not for those who can't do the stairs."
The location of the apartment is perfect. We walked everywhere from our homebase in Beacon Hills. We walked the Freedom Trail,The commons,the Gardens,the north end (little Italy) downtown,the Esplanade,the Newbury shopping area
Within a block of the apartment: Paramount which is famous for breakfast,the line is long but it's kind of a fun must do experience (go on a weekday for shorter line). The pastry shop Tatte,has beautiful sandwiches and light lunch options in addition to out of this world breakfast treats. 75 Chestnut was a lovely upscale dinner and the Upper Crust was fun for a creative slice of pizza on the go. On the days it rained and we didn't want to travel too far,there were plenty of cute little shops to explore on Charles Street,one block away from the apartment,
Closet space was surprisingly generous for a studio apartment in a turn of the century building. There is no dresser,so unpack and use the closet and shelving for your clothes. The little kitchen was complete,although we only used the mini fridge. Shower is definitely one at a time. The wifi worked perfectly.  The TV was easy to figure out. We were out and about all day every day and only used the room to sleep,"so it was perfect for our needs and such an amazing bargain compared to boutique hotels in the area. I would recommend it!\"",,
2126053,50082201,2015-10-09,22499508,Kevin,"A really nice stay. Great location, the total Boston Beacon Hill vib. The apartment is comfortable, everything I needed. Lots of thoughtful touches. The building is old - it's Beacon Hill but it's well cared for and charming. The 2 story walk up would be noticeable for folks with heavy luggage or mobility challenges.  Janet was available, thoughtful and professional. I'd stay again in a flash - thanks for a great week in Boston."
2126053,50740474,2015-10-14,31378567,Michael,"The studio room and en-suite that Janet provided were cozy, comfortable and clean.  Janet provided great information on local attractions and was a very welcoming host.  The kitchenette was a welcome feature, and chocolates on arrival was a nice touch.  The area in Beacon Hill was amazingly convenient (safe, quiet, historic) to the beautiful Boston Common (park), great cafes and restaurants, and the Boston town centre. We were able to walk everywhere which was a real bonus. Thank you Janet for such an enjoyable experience."
2126053,52782836,2015-11-01,44097350,Tom,The host canceled this reservation 57 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2126053,59563029,2016-01-12,8326576,Linda,Janet's studio was exactly as listed and was perfect for my stay.  I always look for clean and convenient and it was definitely that.  (Quiet too which was great.) Janet made sure to check in with me to find out if everything was going well.  Her info. on how to get into the apartment - I arrived very early in the morning - was perfect.  I would definitely stay in Janet's apartment again.

The surrounding Beacon Hill neighborhood is gorgeous, and it was a short walk to morning coffee, restaurants, bars, the park, and transit.  I highly recommend Janet's studio for anyone looking for a nice place to stay in a great Boston neighborhood!"
2126053,85885333,2016-07-13,69396680,Wilson,"A wondrous experience. Beacon Hill is a terrific little neighborhood, chock-full of little boutiques, cafes, and red-brick houses. This listing's location was also incredibly convenient:a 5-minute walk from Boston Common and only 10-15 minutes from the Orange or Red lines on the T."
The actual living space is quite cozy but comfortable and quiet. Very restful and well-stocked with just about every amenity you could ask for (save a washer and dryer,but there's a laundry service across the street).,,,,
All in all,this listing won't be the cheapest that you find,"but I think it affords unbelievable value. I will return.\"",,,

2126053,94944831,2016-08-17,27077842,Kathryn,"The location of Janet's studio cannot be beat. The neighborhood is quaint and picturesque, yet centrally located in Boston.  Cute cafes, bakeries and excellent restaurants within a 2 minute walk. 5 min walk to boston public gardens/boston common and the freedom trail. Also located near the trendy back bay neighborhood and several historical landmarks. The place itself is small, but that is to be expected for a spot in beacon hill. Walking around in the neighborhood is like walking through a history book."
"The bed was comfortable - very firm mattress which works well if you have two people. Janet was an excellent host. Would highly recommend. Note that the shower is small so may not work well for larger people. \"",,,,,

The subway is right across the street so it is very easy to travel to the city. I felt extremely safe traveling alone.   There are restaurants, Dunkin Donuts, etc. within walking distance should you decide to eat nearby.   There is also a mini kitchen that you can use to make meals and Manuela went the extra distance to provide bottled water too. I couldn't have been happier with my experience."
5927267,32382018,2015-05-17,31599576,Gur,Manuela was very helpfull with everything I needed.
The place is very convinient and close to the T underground which is linked to all of Boston. There is also a small shopping area close by for everything one needs.,,,,,
The room is well organized with enough place for two. It is part of a building with two floors,two rooms,a kitchen and a bathroom in each floor.,,,

"Je reviendrai sans hésitation.\"",,,,,
5927267,38406353,2015-07-15,35215244,David,"While Manuela was very helpful and friendly my accommodations were far short of my expectations.  Bathrooms , bedding , linens and kitchen areas all need improvement .  The shower was just a showerhead hanging from a hose near the floor . Not a tissue or paper towel were available. The kitchen area was just a hodgepodge of mixed kitchen utensils and a dirty sponge at the sink. Generally a very unpleasant experience."
5927267,39112564,2015-07-20,16269468,Elsa,"I really enjoyed my stay at Manuela's, the room was spacious and comfy as well. The apartment is well located just next to a train station."

5927267,44244863,2015-08-24,41320614,Peter,"Manuela is very accommodating and hospitable. The room had a full bed with a desk. Most importantly, the air conditioning worked well and resulted in 2 very good nights of sleep for me. My weekend in Boston was very busy and my plans kept changing, but Manuela adapted and made sure everything was set up for me when I finally arrived. This was my first experience with Airbnb so I was a little uncertain going in but the experience was very positive overall. I would definitely recommend staying here."
5927267,44486505,2015-08-26,24203920,Isabelle,"Directly next to the T station, very convenient. Not much happening in the neighborhood itself though. Manuela was very nice and helpful! Great stay."

5927267,45447449,2015-09-02,37797015,Valentin,I stayed for two nights at Manuela's place and I really enjoyed it. The place is very clean and everything was already prepared when I arrived there. The subway station is very close by which was very convenient. Without any doubts I can definitely recommend this place to anyone who visits Boston.
5927267,46487287,2015-09-11,29519002,Dani,"I stayed for five nights at Manuela's place and it was great. The room was very clean and ready when I arrived there. For me the location was perfect because I needed to take the red line subway, and the station was just in front of the place, perfect."
Regarding Manuela,I didn't see her so much,but she helped me with the bags when I arrived and give me very very helpful tips.,,,
I think the neighbourhood is good,I didn't spend so much time there,but all the people I met there was very kind and willing to help. Moreover,there is a grocery at walking distance and some places to get food,just at the end of the street.,

5927267,48551531,2015-09-27,41897548,Ward,"Good place overall. There was a little issue, namely that I locked myself out of my room and they could not find a spare key immediately. Luckily it was found by the time I came back in the evening."
5927267,48940870,2015-09-29,42983843,Kaushik,"The room was exactly as described! Very close to the T and to a convenience store which definitely helps. Room was tidy and the place had good Wi-fi right up at the first floor. Manuela's friend made sure I was comfortable and didn't feel wanting in Manuela's absence. In summary, if you're looking for a budget accommodation with privacy that is close to downtown- this is a functional place! Definitely recommend."
5927267,50879731,2015-10-15,45509769,Max,"Manuela was an excellent host, and made me feel like a welcome guest in her home. Not only did she meet me at the metro station near her house, but she helped me carry my way-too-heavy bag up the stairs to my room."
Speaking of the room,it was roomy,comfortable,and spotlessly clean. The same goes for the bathroom,shower,and the rest of the house.

The home is an older home, but it has a desk and a bed, with a shared Shower and Restroom that you share with 1 other room on your floor, though while I was there no one else was ever in that other room."
Checkin and checkout were really easy and went smooth.  Dining options in the area are limited,but be sure to check out Cafe Polonia,really good authentic Polish food.,,,
For the price and location,"it is worth it.\"",,,,
5927267,53530293,2015-11-09,47290006,Lena,"My experience at Manuela's was great. The room was clean and nice, and while I did share a bathroom with one other guest, I had my peace and privacy the entire time. The arrangements are two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen per floor. The neighborhood is quite interesting, and I did not feel unsafe as some people have said about South Boston. The house is also located right next to Andrew Station, so it's easy to access the Red Line to take you downtown. Overall would recommend!"

5927267,65415994,2016-03-13,47927893,Ricky,Manuela is super nice. This is a basic accommodation for a fair price. Some great polish food in the area and a very convenient location across the street from the T and bus stop.
5927267,66683394,2016-03-24,129814,Bethany,"Manuela was a great host, as many others have said. This is an old house, with the second and third floors each having 2 bedrooms, a bathroom and a mini kitchen. I appreciated that there was space to store some food and leftovers. It was a bit chilly when I was there, and the room and the bathroom were a little cool, but not overly so - I would just recommend warm socks. :) There are some birds nesting just outside the wall of this bedroom, so they do make a little noise, but it's not bad if you anticipate it and know they're there. There is a closet and dresser, along with a desk, in the room."
The location is great for anyone who's using the train while there,and about a 20 minute walk from the conference centre. Definitely recommend taking the Silver Line bus & Red Line train from the airport - really easy,"and free! \"",,,
5927267,67528049,2016-03-29,19530577,Michael,Description was accurate and it was next to subway which was a huge plus
5927267,68704234,2016-04-06,55734588,Shirin,"It was my first time in Boston for a Conference, and I was glad to have found Manuela's accommodations. She was communicative and provided directions from the airport using public transport. Her place is most conveniently located near Andrew Square. She was there to attend to any needs/questions I had, and also respected everyone's privacy. Each of the floors have 2 private bedrooms with a lock with a shared bathroom (for which Manuela provides soap/shampoo as well as towels) and a shared kitchen (fridge, kettle, microwave, stovetop and cutlery). With the free internet - I was well set. I am a walker - so I walked to the Conference Centre (about 1.5 miles each way) while there. Most amazingly - I had left behind an item, and Manuela had gone beyond the call of duty in dealing with this loss. She and her place were a lucky find!"
5927267,70753966,2016-04-20,47718862,David,"Manuela was very nice and friendly host. She checked in regularly to see if all was ok and all my needs covered. Though it is an old house, the rooms are neat and clean. The bathroom very clean and well-stocked with hand-soap, tissue, toilet paper and paper towels. Also provided ample supply of clean towels for showering and washing up."

5927267,81074002,2016-06-20,33744029,Ryan,Manuela's place was perfect for my stay in Boston. Manuela is a very friendly host and the location across the street from a redline station is great for getting around the city.
5927267,89204564,2016-07-27,37226447,Huang,"My wife had 5-night stay in Manuela's home. Manuela was so welcoming and friendly, she always want to make sure my wife was happy, comfortable and satisfied. When my wife said she felt a little bit hot in the room, Manuela asked her husband set up A/C immediately even she was out of home. When she came back, she set up another new room on the 2nd floor for my wife's choice. We were highly appreciate for Manuela's prompt arrangement and accommodating. Manuela's room has great location just bestie red line T Andrew station, 10 minutes or two stops from Boston South station, where easy go to downtown and other places. Thanks again Manuela, for your kind, humble, flexible  and helpful. You are extremely an excellent host. We definitely will stay again and strongly recommend to our friends who will go to Boston."
5927267,91039709,2016-08-03,20295200,Martin,"Trotz später Anreise hat die Schlüsselübergabe bestens geklappt. Der Raum befindet sich im Dachgeschoss eines alten Wohnhauses, Manuela unterstützte uns mit dem Hochtragen des Gepäcks. Auch die Ausstattung des Zimmers ist etwas in die Jahre gekommen, besitzt somit aber einen gewissen Charme - alles nötige ist vorhanden. Einzig das Quitschen des Betts und der Dreck an den Rolläden haben mich etwas gestört. Das Badezimmer war aber sehr sauber und wir verbrachten vier angenehme Nächte bei Manuela. In der Nachbarschaft ist nicht viel los, die Anbindung an den öffentlichen Verkehr liegt jedoch direkt vor der Haustür. [Feedback written in German]"
5927267,92659338,2016-08-09,616965,M.H.,"Great location and wonderful host.  This is a private bed room located on a floor with one other bedroom with shared bathroom, kitchenette.  It is in a traditional older Boston south end neighborhood in a 3 story house and the location is terrific.  It is steps from the metro station and walking distance to the beach.   Because of the proximity to the water, there is a nice sea breeze which is especially nice in the evenings sitting on the front porch.  During our stay, Boston was in the middle of a heat wave, but the room had fans and AC unit and it cooled off nicely at night with sea breeze.  This is an ideal place to stay for anyone who needs a reasonably priced, safe, clean lodging in Boston.  It was convenient to get to the convention center by metro or even by walking.   But by far the best thing is the hostess, Manuela.  She is kind, flexible, generous, and very warmhearted.  We arrived late the first day and she kindly stayed up to welcome us personally.  Then she provided bottled water and even vitamins to us, knowing we just arrived after long plane ride.  So if you need a safe, reasonably priced, convenient place to stay in Boston, with the bonus of a wonderful host, look no further.    Thank you, Manuela!"

One small minus- about 40-50 minutes to downtown by public transport, but it was expected. Also it was a little cold inside, but the weather was cold as well, so may be I'm too picky. Anyway, I recommend this place to staying."
839265,10115551,2014-02-01,1809667,Jenna,I had a great stay!  ToRena's home was clean and she was always available to be sure I had what I needed.  Kitchen was always stocked with breakfast items.  I stayed for a month and found it to be very comfortable and pleasant.  I would recommend these accommodations to anyone looking for a short or long term stay.  The neighborhood felt safe day and night.

The fridge was always full. And Boston is such an awesome city with a lovely atmosphere, lot of things to do and very friendly and helpful people. Great holidays!"
839265,12906487,2014-05-13,3542005,Jeff,"ToRena was very welcoming and helpful in getting me settled into the place. The house is shared amongst 2 other roommates with private rooms and the place was spacious, clean, well equipped and above all has a wicked balcony for sitting in the sun."
In terms of location,the house is about a 20min drive to Boston metro,if that is the goal of your travel,I had a vehicle with me so I wasn't entirely aware of what the public transportation situation was. However I hear Boston has a great transit system.,,
All in all,I really enjoyed my short stay in the Boston area. ToRena and her lovely family did a superb job at welcoming me and providing me with what I needed in my travels. Thanks!,,,,

839265,24103891,2014-12-20,21347350,Jose Miguel,Estuve durante 6 semanas hospedado y me sentí muy bien. Los anfitriones fueron muy amables y se preocuparon para que mi estancia fuera confortable. Tiene básicamente todos los servicios a un paso y la vivienda y habitaciones es amplia. En definitiva muy contento de haber estado allí y haber conocido a ToRena y su familia como anfitriones.
839265,50274790,2015-10-11,37830965,Minho,"I stayed in ToRena's place for 7 weeks while I was doing a clinical rotation at BWH. First, apartment was very well maintained. Kitchen was functioning well and ToRena was providing essentials such as milk, juice, egg etc. To go back and forth BWH, four bus lines are going to Ruggle's station, where I was able to catch the shuttle service. It takes about 45 min every morning, which is not bad at all in Boston. ToRena is living in an Apartment right below. So she is close enough to take care of any necessity but not in the same place. Overall I really enjoyed my staying. Thanks ToRena!"
839265,51203019,2015-10-18,29409106,Débora,"ToRena and her family were very warm and welcoming.

What I also appreciated was how at home I felt. The host left plenty of toiletries  for guests to use like soap, tooth paste, and even an  unopened packaged toothbrush. It was the perfect space for one person for my short 2-day work trip. Only heads up - the apartment is on the 6th floor of a building with no elevator. So just be prepared to walk up and down with luggage. It definitely gave me a workout when I would come back from meetings!"

He made sure we were all set and told us to call him with any questions. The apartment had everything we needed. There was air conditioning. The location was AWESOME. The apartment was on the 6th floor which might be a problem for some with all the stairs. The mattress was not very comfortable. I would definitely stay there again!

Very central location, only 2 minutes walk to Macy's and shops. Billy greeted us on arrival and helped us with our bags. He was contactable if we needed him."

The unit was clean, comfortable and well stocked with amenities.  The location is perfect for exploring Boston.  Just note that it's a 6th floor walk up so, be ready to climb some stairs."
12363660,93001660,2016-08-11,87764809,Kimberly,We had a great stay in Boston; the apartment was as advertised.  Excellent location.
12363660,93963988,2016-08-14,31030733,Nicole,"Staying at Billy's place was a great experience. The location was perfect as it is walkable to so many areas in Boston, and steps away from the subway. His place was clean, full of amenities, and best of all, stocked with water bottles in the fridge - a great touch since it was so hot outside! Billy was also very quick to respond to all of our questions. The only thing to note is that his apartment is on the 6th floor and there is no elevator, so be prepared to have a workout during your stay!"
12363660,97779372,2016-08-28,30736115,Raychel,"Great stay at Billy's place. We had a really late flight into Boston and he was very helpful in accommodating a late check in. Keep in mind the six story walk up, not much of a problem for us but definitely could be for others. Great location, can walk just about anywhere you want to go."

The host was accurate in describing the unit we stayed in.  From the moment we arrived until we left, we had a fantastic vacation.  The unit was very clean and nicely decorated.  We walked from the unit to Cheers, Quincy Market, Fenway Park and other Boston attractions.  I would highly recommend this unit to anyone wishing to visit Boston and enjoy the sights while also getting a good nights rest!"

The house is recently renovated and kept very clean, which (for a neat-freak like me) created a stress-free, relaxing place to live. All of the tenants are very interesting, fun, and professional people who are both conscientious and friendly. The T was super accessible to me as there is a bus stop right at the end of the street that goes to the orange line, and commuting to Cambridge for work was a breeze. Huggy (the landlord) was a very thoughtful and helpful host. I would most definitely stay at 37 Maywood again!"
3656168,52818178,2015-11-02,7414754,Brigitta,The flat was really nice and clean. The room was enough big and consisted of all the  necessary things for short or long term.  My host Huggy is really responsible and he was helpful and available any at time. The public transport is good and close by so it is easy to reach the downtown. I liked to stay here and I would gladly recommend.
3656168,83029060,2016-06-30,53314210,Ellen,"Huggy is a great host, always very friendly and helpful. The neighborhood isn't the best, but it's not to far from downtown Boston, especially not when you have a bike. The room was great, spacious and comfortable. The best thing about staying here was the atmosphere in the house. Everyone was professional, quiet and friendly. With some of the other tenants I shared some meals, we had nice backyard diner parties and we'd go out on tourist trips together. I really enjoyed it, also because none of this felt obligatory. I stayed in the house for three months for a research visit and I really enjoyed my time."
3656168,94997244,2016-08-17,10824906,Naveen,I had a good time staying at this room. Housemates were friendly and host was very responsive and professional. The neighbourhood has a laidback vibe with friendly people. It has good connectivity to the downtown area with frequent buses from the nearby bus stop.

Es ist super zentral gelegen und von dort kann man sowohl zu Fuß als auch mit der T alle wichtigen Orte Bostons bequem erreichen. Die Wohngegend ist sehr schön. Das Appartement ist gut eingerichtet, funktional und sauber.  Es ist vor Ankunft wichtig, seine E-Mails zu checken, um die Codes für die Türen zu bekommen? Wir haben Will nicht persönlich getroffen, aber auf Mails hat er zuverlässig reagiert."
658029,2704212,2012-10-24,3710859,Kim,"This was a fabulous place to stay.  Lots of restaurants nearby.  Lunched at The Parish the first day as we waited for the apartment to be ready and breakfasted at Mike's Diner the last morning before we headed out.  Easy walking distance to the Metro.  Unit was very clean and comfortable.  Nice kitchen, though we didn't use it.  Will was very responsive to our inquiries and left a nice book of things to do in the area.  All in all, a great experience."
658029,2825948,2012-11-07,3681658,Dirk,"The place was perfect for our stay, and the couch folds out into a nice bed with an inflatable air mattress (much more comfortable than most sofa beds). Will was prompt in his responses and with keycodes for the doors all we had to do was show up! I would definitely recommend."
658029,2980031,2012-11-27,382114,Ryan,"Will's 1 bed in the South End is adequately sized and furnished for a long weekend stay for my family, using both the bedroom and the pull-out couch. Mostly IKEA style, but all-in-all functional and pretty comfortable. Is used exclusively as a rental so it has some dings, but for the price in Boston, a very reasonable option. Tremont St can be pretty noisy at night, but no fault of the renter's there."
Keyless entry was great + communication with the owner was fluid and easy. He was highly accommodating when I added another night onto the front of our reservation at the last minute -- thanks,"Will. \"",,,,
658029,3750825,2013-03-11,4069598,John And Grace,"This stay did not live up to our expectations. First off, it wasn't actually the apartment we expected. It was a different place than pictured here. Similar in style and furnishings, but without the bay window I'd been looking forward to, and with a different floor plan."
Secondly,when  we contacted Will to ask about the mix-up,he didn't get back to us until the following day. When he did return my message,it was to say that the apartment I requested was not available,but this one was even nicer. To me,it wasn't nicer and I requested that we be moved into the apartment we had been looking forward to.
We never heard back from him.,,,,,
The apartment we stayed in was fine. Nothing wrong with it except that it didn't match the photos and didn't have the one feature I had really been looking forward to: the bay window in the bedroom.,,,,,

658029,4457378,2013-05-06,5860067,Hannes,"Great place that very much lived up to the expectations we had. The South End is a vibrant area, so obviously it can sometimes get a little noisy in the neighbourhood, but that's a very small price to pay for being so close to a lot of great restaurants, boutiques and sights within walking distance. Will was very communicative, even while already there, and answered any questions we had via email fast. Overall, a great first experience on airbnb!"
658029,4841237,2013-05-28,663787,Kate,I had a great stay at Will's. The place was clean and bright and really well located. Recommended.
658029,5237021,2013-06-19,4877932,Meryl,"Unfortunately our stay was not what we had hoped. The apt was fine, but the air conditioner did not work for the 2 nights we were there. It was very hot and stuffy, and opening the windows was not an option due to the significant street noise. We contacted Will numerous times, but there was no attempt to help out with something like a fan (since fixing it was not in the cards).  Will acknowledged that this had been an issue in the past, but obviously had not been fixed. It was really uncomfortable."
There was no soap for the shower,which is really a nit picky thing to say. Not a huge deal,but it would have been nice to know that you are supposed to bring your own before we arrived.,,,
Street noise was an issue - especially if you are a light sleeper,There is also a crying baby in the next apartment (whose bedroom shares a wall with this apartment bedroom),so there is random crying at times of the day/night.,,,
"We were disappointed and it would be hard to recommend staying there\"",,,,,
658029,5409010,2013-06-29,4842947,Heike,Never again!
We didn’t  get the apartment we booked. The owner sent us the door codes of another apartment without informing us that this is not the one we booked.  When we contacted him he because we realized that the number of the shown unit does not match with our reservation he returned this message one day later and informed us that our apartment is overbooked and not available.,,,,,
As we could see in other reviews this happened not the first time.,,,,,
We were really disappointed,because we had no choice. Something like that should not happen. The apartment was functional and clean but not the one we expected.,,,,
We knew that Tremont St can be pretty noisy at night and that is no fault of the owner but  we didn’t expect paper thin walls so you could hear everything that loud especially the neighbours.,,,,,

658029,8418511,2013-10-29,1807282,Simon,"Comfortable, cosy apartment containing everything needed. Nice not to have to worry about keys in favour of access codes. Only negative is that it is a little noisy due to being next to a busy road junction, and the noise from the upstairs shower. Handy location: short walk from Prudential mall and shopping streets."

The apartment was exactly as described, with a convenient keyless entry.  The bedroom had a nice desk, which made it pleasant to work at the bay windows in the evening.  Road noise is abundant, but expected in a city.  the bathroom was recently remodeled, as well as the kitchen: those were spotless."

658029,14638413,2014-06-23,15575726,Lindsay,"My friend and I enjoyed our stay in Boston's South end- easily one of our favourite neighbourhoods! The place was exactly as the photos and description advertised; very clean, comfortable and accessible to everything Boston has to offer. The only thing to consider is there was limited contact with the host; as they do not live in the building and it is a rental property. The cleaning staff arrives promptly at 11:00 am (or in our case earlier) which is something to keep in mind. However, the locals were very friendly and helpful suggesting restaurants, bars and places to see in the South end. Here are some must-see places to eat & drink :"
Toro Restaurant (tapas- fantastic) - 1704 Washington Street (7 min walk),,,,,
Tremont 647  (great brunch) - 647 Tremont (down the street),,,,,
Mike & Patty's (also great brunch- very small but amazing ) 12 Church street (about a 15 min walk),,,,,
Coppa (gets busy so a reservation is best) -253 Shawmut Ave (15-20 min walk),,,,,
The Beehive (just went for drinks; cool jazz bar/lounge) 541 Tremont (15 min walk),,,,,
"Will definitely be visiting Boston again!\"",,,,,
658029,18549897,2014-08-28,18090017,Chris,"Stayed with my mum for three nights in August 2014. Excellent access to the city, only a couple of minutes from the orange line subway and 15 minutes from downtown. As other reviews have noted, it is on a busy street which leads to a lot of road noise and loud music (Sunday night until 1am), 24 hours a day. It was fine with earplugs ."
The apartment was clean and well fitted with a nice bathroom and well stocked kitchen (we noted a minor issue: the valve was broken on the inflatable sofabed but it was still ok to sleep on). AC in the bedroom kept things cool.,,,,,
"Overall I would recommend this apartment due to the ease of access to downtown and Boston's Southend but be aware of the noise when booking.\"",,,,,
658029,19823193,2014-09-19,18939731,Caroline,"We had a great stay in Boston. The apartment was exactly as described and looks like the pictures. It was very clean and in a very good condition, with all the equipment for a comfortable stay. The mattress of the bed is very good, and the bathroom is modern like new. It is conveniently located, close to many transportation stops (orange line at 5mn walk, bus n.1 stop at 2 mn walk, and downtown just 20 or 30 mn walk). Plenty of places to eat around. Very easy to go sightseeing or working downtown or to Cambridge (MIT/Harvard). Bed linen and several towels are provided, which is very convenient when you come with limited luggage."
As mentioned by other visitors,the whole building seems to be a rental property. The doors open thanks to an electronic lock system. The contact with host is limited.,,,,
The only thing to be warned about (as mentioned by other visitors) is the noise coming from the street. As most of the apartments in Boston,one of the windows in the bedroom has an AC device stuck into it,so that the window is like if it was open all the time. Fresh air is coming in during the night (13 degrees celsius outside in late Sept.) and a lot of noise coming from the street until late at night. But such devices seem to be omnipresent in any apartment in Boston.,,,
Overall we recommend this place because it is very nice and conveniently located,for a reasonable price,"but be aware of the noise.\"",,,

The apartment itself is very clean and tastefully decorated,with new furnishings throughout. The shower was large and had great water pressure. The kitchen was stocked. Basically,it felt like home right away.,,,
The location is quite central - South End and the neighboring Back Bay are very nice neighborhoods to wander around. I was also able to run across and along the Charles in the morning.,,,,,
The apt has the convenience of a digital lock,so you don't need to keep track of a key. The wifi and AC also work well.,,,,
Only a few small complaints: the first,which has already been mentioned,is that the apt is just off a fairly busy intersection,so you do get some traffic noise throughout the evening. This was not loud enough to bother either of us staying there,but if you are a light sleeper,you might want to bring ear plugs or consider a more isolated apartment. The second is that I thought 11am was a bit too early of a check-out time. I could've used another hour or two. But not a big deal. The third is that
658029,20691623,2014-10-04,19289817,Chris,"Will was responsive in communication and allowed us to drop of bags a few hours early. The apartment was big enough -- and there's a pull out bed in the couch. Traffic was a bit noisy in the morning and through out the day but settles down fine at night. The location is a few minutes walk from Northeastern University, great dining options, Starbucks, small groceries, and more. We arrived early got in via a door code and had solid directions emailed to us two days before arrival. Overall it was a good first experience on Airbnb."
658029,21074602,2014-10-11,18647194,Marion,"The apartment was exactly as described and looks like the picture. It's modern and very clean with a fully equipped kitchen but a bit too small for four people. But we still felt very comfortable. The apartment ist close to many transportation stops and it' s easy to access the city by foot and by the T. It' s a great place to discover Boston as a tourist. Unfortunately there is a lot of traffic noise, because the apartment is located at a busy intersection. If you are a light sleeper, it could be very helpful to wear ear plugs at night."
658029,21148821,2014-10-12,21253902,Chris,"The place was nice and well maintained; exactly what the pictures looked like. Was a bit confused at how the lock keypad worked. When calling the host and leaving a voicemail I received no reply whatsoever. I figured it out immediately after leaving the voicemail, but a response would've been appreciated in case I was locked out. Other than that, great location and would recommend."
658029,21389866,2014-10-16,21079520,Anita,Great place in a great location.  You will eat your way around this neighborhood! The host is also good to liaise with but will mostly leave you to your own devices.

658029,32459209,2015-05-18,27536032,Francis,This is a great location and very accessible to the T (subway) stop by a 5-7 minute walk. We did not interact with the host at all during our stay. The apartment was perfect for the 4 of us -- clean and exactly as described. The pullout couch was a little uncomfortable with worn out springs but we didn't mind too much. The only issue we had was that we had no pillowcases for the two pullout couch pillows. We contacted the maintenance number given to us via text but did not receive a reply so we ended up just putting the pillows underneath the fitted sheet to keep them clean. It would have been nice to have pillowcases for those pillows and for the host to reply in case we had a more major issue. It was only a minor inconvenience for us and would stay with this host again.

Street noise is very loud.  A white noise machine would have been helpful. People shouting and loud music, police and fire sirens, semi trucks, waste trucks etc. noise was common day and night. There are two sodium street lights on the street right outside the bedroom window and it is bright enough in the bedroom to read all night long. Room darkening shades are needed. Neighborhood was very convenient for site seeing. Felt safe, lots of people out walking and jogging. People in the neighborhood are friendly. Lovely walk between apartment and Convention center accessible from Columbus street.  Location was easy to find. Bed was comfortable. Pull out couch in addition to the bed. Well stocked with linens, toilet paper, hand soap and pots and pans. No cooking supplies or shampoo etc and non expected by this renter."

The listing was accurate and the place clean. I appreciated the communication I received from both Will and Airbnb leading up to my stay in Boston.  We unfortunately, arrived later than expected on a Sunday night and I was concerned over how we'd get in to the house and the orientation to both the neighborhood and the place. However, the instructions we received at the onset and the ease at getting in to the apt put our minds at ease."
The place is right on Tremont Street which can get busy and on the first night it took us a while to adjust to the noise.  However,the second night we eased into the place and the noise was less of a factor. We also found easy access to both the public transportation and a hot cup of coffee.,,,,
Overall our first Airbnb experience was a good one and I anticipate we'll be doing more stays at unique and fun places like this in the future.,,,,,

When I tried to reach the maintenance dept, the real estate agency or Will : always answering machine ! We really wanted to go discover Boston, but did not want to leave our valuables unattended in the apartment. That way we lost an hour trying to reach someone."
Moreover,after a long journey from Europe and arriving (for us) in the middle of the night,"it would be nice to find at least a bottle of water in the apartment. It costs nothing and it makes you feel welcome.\"",,,

658029,46581239,2015-09-12,34008056,Drennette,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and everything about our accommodations was exactly what we had hoped for from the information provided and from the other reviews.  The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and yes it is on a very busy street and a little noisy, but that was what we wanted, we wanted to feel like we were part of the neighborhood.  Never felt concerned for our safety and enjoyed blending in with the neighborhood.  The apartment is conveniently located to public transportation and very easy to get to most of the tourist destinations.   Had great meals at the Summer Shack and The Parish Café, both places that were recommended in the information in the apartment, Also had delicious pizza at both New York Pizza and South End Pizza restaurants that are right there close to the apartment."
658029,47165995,2015-09-16,25819074,Jeppe,Very nice place. Clean and perfect. Great location.
658029,47706542,2015-09-21,40303759,David,"The location was perfect for us.  The apartment was very clean and newly renovated.    Access was easy and a problem with the door locking mechanism was fixed right away.   The big drawback was that the city noise was extremely loud.   It was louder in the bedroom than in the sitting room with the kitchen.  We could hear everything that happened on the street.  Some of the reviews stated that it was loud because of the City location, but it was way more than expected.  Additionally, the shades did nothing to block out the street light so the room was very bright at night.  Nights two and three were better because we stopped by CVS and got some ear plugs and sleeping masks.  So if you are a light to medium sleeper think twice."
658029,48519695,2015-09-27,39175839,Marilyn,"We arrived, our daughter had blown up the bed with no problems. It was very accessible and great decor. Shower was nicely redone. The only complaint is that the noise outside was intense! 2 of the 4 nights there was a drunk on the street below from 2-3 AM. However, That is beyond your control. Overall loved the convenience of the rental!"
658029,48989278,2015-09-30,23304422,Jolie,"This apartment was absolutely clean and as described in the listing. The kitchen was clean, big, and helped us save lots of money by cooking breakfast each morning."
The apartment is super close (2 blocks) to the T (orange line at mass ave.) and also the bus line #1 stops at the corner.,,,,,
The bed was comfortable and clean. The bathroom is small but everything worked well and was super clean.,,,,,
When we had a question,we called the phone number and someone answered right away and gave us the answer to our question. Couldn't have had better or easier communication.,,,,
The locks for the front door to the building and the door to the apartment are keypad-coded locks. No need to worry about keys.,,,,,
Couldn't have been happier with our stay!,,,,,

I would certainly stay here again."
658029,53540630,2015-11-09,22294259,Paul,"The place was very well kept and beautiful. It was a little noisy being next to a busy street but that was expected. It is within walking distance to many nearby bars and restaurants, there is also a convenience store down the block and a gas station across the street. The rental is actually managed by another party, (URL HIDDEN) , so it wasnt the Airbnb homey feel we were looking for. Will was very responsive and easy to work with."
658029,55918542,2015-12-07,39644556,Janice,The apartment was exactly as described. Not as noisy as we thought it would be. Perfect location for us. We will book it again.

We liked that there was a keypad entry so that anyone could come and go if necessary. It's not in the central area if you're looking for that. The space was a little small, and the pull out bed in the living room could be more comfortable but it was prefect for us. Thank you for the pleasant stay!"
658029,68719472,2016-04-06,1742871,Baird,"The apartment is very comfortable, spacious and well located. Even with the snow we experienced (in April), it was easy to get around and there are plenty of restaurants nearby for when we didn't want to go to far."

The location was ideal for us with parking garages nearby, the T for easy public transportation and of course restaurants and shopping. Our host made us feel very at home and had great recommendations for us. Being that I am in the vacation planning industry I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a safe, clean and Zen like accommodations."
2694019,13095661,2014-05-19,14517251,Elizabeth,Gina was more then gracious! We felt completely welcomed. Communication before during and after our stay was excellent. The location was perfect! Access to the T couldn't have been better. What an amazing stay! We highly recommend Gina and her beautiful apartment!
2694019,14496731,2014-06-20,11023111,Leora,"I enjoyed my brief stay at Gina's apartment.  The apartment was beautiful, the location was great and Gina was a wonderful host.  Excellent communication.  She was available to answer questions about parking etc.  Highly recommended!"
2694019,16041461,2014-07-20,16008240,Barb,Great location! 3 minute walk to Back Bay Station. Gina was accommodating and worked with us to obtain the key on the day of check in (as we had meetings all day and she was flexible so we didn't have to worry). The apartment is comfortable. 3 flights of stairs however and no elevator. It was strenuous bringing our belongings up and down but great exercise. We'd go back again no question!
2694019,16874078,2014-08-03,12962961,Lauren,"Gina was a wonderful host! She really helped my friend and I out when we were in a bind traveling to Boston at the last minute.

2694019,19763391,2014-09-17,2203446,Hamish,"Simply perfect.  I got landed with a last minute work trip to Boston. Hotels were up around the $800 p/night and I was in a bind, but Gina came to the rescue...!  She managed to change her schedule around to accommodate me, get the apartment ready and ensure that I was well situated.  Her apartment is ace..!  It's literally in the heart of the hot Back Bay district and is just perfect for a guest.  The bed is comfortable, it's very clean and everything you need.  I give a top-top recommendation."

Her place was nice, clean, and situated in a very ideal part of town (I was able to walk to most areas of Boston proper).  There are plenty of food and drink options within short walking distance, notably in the Back Bay and South End.  Definitely recommended!"
2694019,21290490,2014-10-14,4391928,Susan,"Great location.  Easy to walk to all the Boston sites and close to good restaurants in South End.   No elevator - walk up 3 flights of stairs.   It is on a busy street so there is some street noise and earplugs are recommended.  Otherwise, it is a very quiet building.   Very comfortable bed.   Only issue we had was the Wi-Fi was not working - only had for 1 of 5 nights.  The hostess tried hard to fix, but see it was an issue with a previous guest (whose review was not avail when I rented)."
2694019,21614556,2014-10-20,12553958,Dara,Gina was very accommodating and met us in a timely manner. Her apartment was very clean and comfortable.  We enjoyed the location  in the heart of Boston - just down the street from the Library and Copley Square!

2694019,30549464,2015-04-24,2589181,Shu,Amazing place. Great location. Amazing host. So lucky to have found this place!
2694019,31079935,2015-05-01,13641950,Brian,After another host canceled Gina was able to get me in at the last minute.  I was in town for a conference and elected to find use airbnb vs stay at the conference hotel; when the first host canceled the hotel was booked.  Her place worked for what I needed and my stay was overall pleasant but there are a few things that I wish I had known going in.
The apartment didn't actually have A/C (doesn't get installed till May).  While this makes sense and I understand; it did require that the windows be open to stay cool which normally would be great except it is on a busy street so noise was an issue (even with earplugs).,,,,,
The apartment doesn't have what most would consider wifi -- instead Gina offered a mobile hotspot which isn't exactly the same thing.  Not a big deal as I was rarely there and really just needed a bed to crash on.,,,,,
So would I have stayed here knowing what I know now -- yes it worked for what I needed and I was in a pinch.  In the future I would probably just stay at the conference hotel.  The location was perfect for what I needed (close to the hotel) and the bed was actually really comfortable,and the price for that part of town was good.,,,,

Note that it's on a 3rd floor with no lift, there's no TV, internet is available through a weak Mifi device, it's very noisy outside (ie. provided earplugs!), etc."

2694019,49984325,2015-10-08,11993977,Teresa,"Gina replied promptly to all our emails both before and during our stay at her apartment. Her place is on the second floor of an old building but is furnished in a modern contemporary style. The lounge was comfortable, light and airy and the kitchen area had all that you need including a coffee machine. The bathroom was small but adequate. The bedroom faces the front and was noisy, especially on Saturday night but the bed was extremely comfortable and we slept well after our days of walking around Boston."
2694019,68517115,2016-04-05,63407287,Andrew,"Great place to stay. Right next to the T (which if you're new to Boston as I was is the subway/train, and don't worry you can't hear it). Short walk to the convention center, and you can actually walk indoors most of the way if you enter the Westin up the street. If you're a runner, it's close to the Esplanade which will let you run about as far as you want by the river."
Other reviews mentioned some issues which may be a problem for some people but certainly not for me. The bathroom/shower is really small,but if you want a big bathroom with double vanities you probably should look for a hotel and spend twice as much. There is some street noise,but nothing more than expected for any urban area and was easily drowned out with a fan that was provided. Other than that,"I think just read the other reviews since they're pretty accurate.\"",,

High ceilings, a tub in the bathroom and a brandnew kitchen. The windows are huge and you have light the whole day, you don't need to turn the lights on. I was attending to Berklee, who is near to the most popular part of the city: copley square, prudential center, newbury st. , etc. And every morning I walked there from the apartment, just a 15 minutos walk. If I come back to Boston I will be renting the same apartment for sure! Thank you again, Laura"

LOVED the south end neighborhood... and the space that laura has created is practically perfect... great building... lots of light... everything you need... and she is very helpful if you need anything at all. My experience staying here was amazing and I definitely will book her again the next time Im in Boston :)

I was visiting family for the holidays who live around the corner and the location was perfect! I did not need help from Laura but know if I had needed help she would have been available. She checked in twice to make sure we were all set and had everything we needed. The apartment is right on Tremont Street in the best part of the South End - surrounded by restaurants, shopping, nightlife, etc. The apartment is cozy and perfect for one or two people! We did not use the kitchen but it looked nice and well equipped. I would LOVE to stay here again next time I visit my family!"
1275498,10980102,2014-03-16,11798039,Gretchen,"My Stay at 592 Tremont St was great. Laura was a responsive and courteous host, accommodating any needs I had throughout my 2 month stay. The place itself was very comfortable. Cooking was a blast in the apartment. The local grocery store has plenty of fresh organic ingredients and the apartment comes equipped with everything I needed to prepare food, sans some basic cooking staples like oil. I commuted to work to Cambridge on the weekdays and had no trouble getting to and from work. The busses in the neighborhood are clean and un-intimidating, so public transportation was my default means of transportation. When I needed to get somewhere quick, I could hail a taxi very easily from right outside the apartment. The locals in the neighborhood were easy to converse with and didn’t give me an outsider treatment when they found out I wasn’t local. After the 2 months I spent here I left with a very strong impression of what living in Boston is like."
1275498,11397222,2014-04-01,10202183,Mary,My stay here was very pleasant. Laura was very attentive to my needs and responded quickly and professionally whenever I contacted her.

Beautiful old building and architecture with all of the modern amenities. The location is the best part. Ideal location. Close to so many wonderful restaurants, and an easy walk to shopping on Boylston and downtown (where I was working). This place was a dream. I didn't want to leave!"
1275498,13536662,2014-05-30,6230939,Sophie,Laura was absolutly lovely. She is wonderfully considerate from offering her expertise in Boston to making sure there was something to eat and drink in the apartment after a long international flight. The studio itself is wonderful - in a beautiful  historic  Boston terrace and located in one of the nicest areas of the city. The south end of Boston is full of wonderful food options and cute little shops. It is also a 7 minute walk to Bay Bay station so getting around is a breeze. I stayed here after moving from overseas and the studio had everything i needed to live and work quite comfortably.  I absolutly recommend if you are looking for somewhere to live temporarily/ have a longer stay in Boston this is the perfect place
1275498,15029447,2014-07-01,1139040,John,We stayed at the Parlor Retreat for a month while working in Boston.   The building is located in the center of the vibrant south end and is surrounded by award winning restauraunts.  The standout feature of this updated apartment is cleanliness.  The unit is and feels very clean.  Laura was also very accomadating and immediately assisted us when we briefly lost the keys to the apartment.  We would definetly stay in her building again and look forward to our next visit.

Die Wohngegend ist sehr sympathisch und es ist nicht weit zu Fuß zur Orange Line/ Back Bay Station. Laura hat bereits im Vorfeld alle wichtigen Fragen beantwortet und sich auch bei der Anreise flexibel gezeigt. Leider hat sie nicht im Voraus erwähnt, dass momentan Renovierungsarbeiten am Haus durchgeführt werden. Laura hat jedoch unverzüglich und professionell auf meine Fragen und Wünsche reagiert."
1275498,33770495,2015-06-01,19911503,Andrew,"Everything about my experience was great.  The location is fantastic -- steps from great restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, pharmacies, and yoga studios (if that's your thing).  You can easily commute to anywhere via public transit --  Back Bay T stop (orange line) is only about 7 minutes away by walking and the Copley T stop (green line) is only a few minutes further and there is even a useful bus stop on this block.  The host, Laura, was fantastic.  She welcomed me into the place, helped with luggage and always made sure my stay was enjoyable (over a span of several months!).  The apartment itself has everything you need -- good heating and A/C, a good and efficient kitchen, a very nice bathroom, and the design and layout are great too.  There really isn't anything not to like about the place unless you need a lot of space.  I would HIGHLY recommend you stay here -- you will not regret it."

I had gone by only the Reviews when confirming and am so glad that I did! The feedback that I read was all that I experienced in my one month stay in September ! Laura was the perfect host, ensuring comfort at all times including loaning an air mattress when my son was visiting; a blender from her own personal kitchen to prepare my Indian meals for my son; etc. The place is so central and the time flew by very quickly! Apartment is super clean with good linen and kitchen items. Perhaps the 2 things Laura could add to make it perfect is a chest of drawers as there is no proper closet to organize personal clothes and fix the window curtains in the room. Overall, a wonderful experience and am glad I found this place. Will definitely recommend to people for short or long term stay. Thank you Laura"

1275498,75421474,2016-05-21,39575532,Rosalina,"Trusting on other reviews, we decided to rent this studio. But we wouldn't recommend anyone to rent this studio."
We stayed here for 7 weeks and because of the host we didn't feel very welcome. We were approximately 15 minutes earlier than check-in time. She complained that we were so early and that we were lucky the studio was ready at that time. After this she started complaining about our rolling suitcases and that we should lift them,however she didn't even help us while we were struggeling. 5 Minutes later she left the studio and said she would be back in an hour to answer all our questions. However,she didn't came back,so a lot of questions remained unanswered and we couldn't find a lot of things.,,
Some things are changed in the studio compared to the picture shown,for example the sofa. Also,not much things were included,for example there was only one roll of toilet paper left and you have to buy your own cleaning wipes. The studio itself is very small,especially for two persons. She didn't say that to us on forehand. The bath is too short for anyone to lie down and the shower is really low (one had to shower squating). Also it doesn't contain much kitchenware,so you have to wash it every day. We stayed here with two persons and one of them couldn't sleep in the bed
After she found out that we were younger people,she also wanted us to pay a lot more for cleaning! One time we last minute took off the morning from work and we literally had to leave the building because the regular cleaners were coming to the studio.,,,,
You also can't regulate your own temperature,so sometimes it is too hot and sometimes it is too cold. There are two heating radiators who are very old and made a lot of noise. We reported this to the host and she didn't take us seriously,because she kept saying these were just normal sounds and nobody did ever notice this to her. However,the first weeks we couldn't even sleep because of this sound. Eventually,she only fixed one of the radiators and she kept saying the other one was too new to fix and it wasn't broken,while it still made a lot of noise.
"So all in all we were really disappointed and surely wouldn't stay here again.\"",,,,,

The bedrooms were bigger than we thought they would be,  the key pickup was painless and the location was great - it gave us a view of the river.

5717690,34295897,2015-06-07,29972844,Kate,We had a great stay here for one week in Boston for a wedding- good location and easy access to transport. Everything in the flat was clean and well maintained. There were three of us so we used the sofa bed which was fine- but you probably only want to stay with family or close friends since once the sofa bed is out in the main room there is not much space to spare. Access to the flat using a code made things very easy as our groups were arriving at different times.
5717690,36606465,2015-06-29,32034999,Stephanie,"For the purpose of just a place to crash for the next days events, the place met our needs.  Location was close to places to eat and a ten minute walk to additional areas for eating and shopping.  Felt safe in the neighborhood and was comfortable."
5717690,37738872,2015-07-10,31163463,Yan,"We had a very pleasant stay. The unit is just as described, very clean, wonderful location, convenient to everywhere. Surprisingly, it is even not too difficult to find street parking! We were able to find street parking every evening, within 2 blocks.  (Of course, you need to drive around for a little bit. )"
This place is highly recommended.,,,,,

5717690,39397250,2015-07-23,20643257,Jacques,"Belle expérience pour une première aux Etats Unis. L'appartement correspondait à ce que nous avait dit Will  (même si nous avons été surpris par la matelas gonflable du 2e lit,). Bien situé et très agréable, nous avons pu profiter de nos 4 jours passés à Boston. Nous le recommandons."
5717690,40314651,2015-07-30,15546576,Lee,"Our family of four (2 and 5 year old kids) came for a family vacation to Boston.  We were traveling without a car and chose this place because of its close proximity to the T.  The T is two blocks away and were able to get to Harvard, LEGOLAND, Revere Beach, downtown and the airport all by using the T.  There is also a bus stop just outside the door that will take you straight to the Boston Commons."
We ate at the Parish Café across the road and another night we walked a few blocks to Orinoco,a Venezuelan restaurant,that was excellent.  Highly recommend the arepas.  We also walked about 4 blocks to Whole Foods for groceries.,,,
The unit itself is spacious although the bathroom is a bit tight as the door opens inwards.  Definitely one person at a time.  Was really impressed to find a good quality hairdryer to use.  You will need to provide your own soap for the shower.,,,,,
The kitchen was well stocked with pots,pans and utensils if you are looking to cook.,,,,
During the day there is a lot of noise from traffic and sirens. (Bostonians honk a lot!)  Was worried we wouldn't be able to sleep,but it actually gets pretty quiet at night and no one had problems sleeping.,,,,
Was also worried about coming in the middle of summer with the heat.  However,we were pleased to find that the air conditioner kept the unit very cool.,,,,
We appreciated being able to drop off our luggage earlier in the day before check in so we didn't have to haul it around town.  The room is up three flights of stairs so be prepared for a work out.  Luckily we packed light so it wasn't a big deal.,,,,,
Thank you for a great stay and we hope to visit again!,,,,,

Subway wasn't too far, stores were close by and having a kitchen was so nice!  The rooms were clean and ready for us!  We had no problems at all!  It was also a great big plus that there was laundry room downstairs!  It was very easy to get in to check in and check out of the room!  Also loved the binder with info! I highly recommend!"
5717690,43946240,2015-08-23,6312501,Megan,The apartment is well situated with everything you need. Will sent along a wonderfully detailed email with all the details on the space and neighbourhood. We had a great time.
5717690,47486227,2015-09-19,37514749,Melody,"Nicely remodeled 3 story walk up. Great neighborhood with local cafes and nearby subway stations. Has one full size bed and one fold out sofa. Both are acceptable. Nice big hot shower as well as a microwave, dishwasher, coffee maker and blow dryer. Very clean and comfortable.  A couple of drawbacks. WiFi is hit or miss and the street noise at night will require earplugs. Lots of sirens and motorcycles throughout the night. Also the old stair case is a bit steep and may pose a challenge for some. Will not accommodate disabled.   All in all a very enjoyable experience."
5717690,47727163,2015-09-21,26081316,Brendon,"Stay was great! Good location, plenty of food/drink locations close by. Train close by and laundry facilities are excellent. The place is clean and neat. My only tiny issues were the corner of the street was a bit noisy and considering I pay a service fee and there is a cleaner I was still expected to take the trash out which I thought was a bit weird."
5717690,49458907,2015-10-04,19817390,Gabe,"Spotlessly clean, modern, and a good location! It's like a serviced apartment, doesn't have the quirks of staying in someone else's home with all their random stuff. There are good restaurants and cafes within easy walking distance. The unit is small but fine for two people. There is some street noise, as other reviewers have noted."

5717690,50275647,2015-10-11,37908174,Richard,Very nice clean apartment. The unit was on the 3rd floor so all quiet above us. Only down side is the staircase was a steep set of winders and negotiating luggage was a bit cumbersome but not a deal breaker in anyway.
Kitchen was clean and well stocked though we didn't use it to much. The bathroom is a space planning challenge. Having the door opening out could be a plus but it was clean with a nice large shower.,,,,,

5717690,52965805,2015-11-03,4403274,May,"The apartment was well-located with nice restaurants and shops nearby as well as the T. Check-in instructions were clear and easy. One thing I would say is that it is quite a lot smaller than the photos suggest (to me anyway), and the street below is pretty noisy. This might not have been an issue if there hadn't been construction going on at the time we were staying. Also the wifi connection was not great. We never met the hosts as Boston Short Term Rentals runs these listings but communication with Naydeesha was good."

5717690,64445296,2016-03-04,39644556,Janice,"We had rented another apartment from Will last December so we knew the building and the area. It was perfect for our visit to see our new Grandson. Unfortunately the unit we rented on our last visit was not available so we had to go with a different one on a higher floor. The stairs, all thought not our first choice, we're not an issue for us. The bedroom in the apartment was very small. The bed was up to the wall on one side but quite comfortable. The living area was large enough but with very limited TV stations. The bathroom was so small and the layout so bad that my husband had to step into the shower to close the door to get to the sink. We knew going in that the unit was small, but for our short stay and the perfect location  we were willing to sacrifice the space."
Unfortunately,Will,you need to get a new cleaning person. The floor in the kitchen was sticky. There was dust and crumbs within sight under the refrigerator. The refrigerator had dried spilled smelly something on the back of the top shelf and crumbs stuck in between the shelf and the refrigerator wall. There also was a bag of chicken nuggets in the freezer. The counters had dried crumbs and sticky bits on them that only took a little scrubbing by me to get them off. And the worst was that the sink smelled like rotting food. We figured out that it was coming from the garbage disposal. We ran lots of hot water (once we figured out how to turn the hot water heater on) into the disposal and then put dish soap in it till it filled up. Put the plug in and let it set all night,then ran more hot water while running the disposal. It was better but we still could smell it. The floor under the sink in the bathroom was dirty too.,,
Unfortunately we don't think we will stay there again.,,,,,

5717690,71284162,2016-04-24,2468460,Renata,Our stay was pleasant in this apartment. Not great but not bad. We did book late and we're lucky to find something.
Gorgeous neighbourhood and close to nice restaurants and the back Bay Area.,,,,,
However we were 4 adults and in our opinion the apartment was too small for us to feel 'comfortable'. Lucky we weren't in Boston to stay inside. The apartment itself was clean,the bedroom bed was comfortable but the sofa bed was difficult to sleep on.  It also lacked the Airbnb 'experience'. We hardly had any communication with the owners as it is through a short term rental company and when we booked our parking we had no idea if it was even confirmed. Called the company several times however no one ever picked up. We parked anyway and the card was charged. But a confirmation or response would've been appreciated.,,,,
I choose Airbnb for the personal interaction with locals even if I don't meet them and by staying here it was not this.,,,,,
Otherwise we love Boston,just not sure if this place was value for the money and if we would return.,,,,

We were attending a graduation at Northeastern and it was just an easy two block walk. It is located on a busy intersection, so just be aware that you do hear the sounds of the city! The apartment itself is clean, bright, and comfortable. The bathroom is a bit small, but nicely renovated with a good sized shower. We were on the fourth floor which provided a good view, but beware of the stairs!"

Better suited for two people instead of 4 both in space and sleeping conditions.

3166256,14137538,2014-06-12,15856042,Vanessa,Jessica will be the best host you will ever have with Airbnb. We have stayed in Jessica for a total of 6 nights but it feels like it were just yesterday. Guests who stay with her will feel that the house and the room is very clean and new and always filled with pleasant scent (either from fresh flowers or from candles). The beddings are super comfy and the decoration in her house will make you feel like you are in an art museum.
The best thing about Jessica is also the thing that distinguish her from other host that is she is a very good people reader. She knows when to share with us her living experience,give us travel and food advise and so much more,but she also leave us with a lot of privacy so that we can enjoy the time together in her house.,,,
The oasis in her front porch is a perfect place for having meals or just tea by yourself or with your family,it has a great view of the big lawn grassy area that is very well maintained and also breeze of wind carrying scents of flowers in the garden,"it really makes you feel very relaxed and keep away from all the noise and busy living in Boston.

When we visited this beautiful place that our hostess opened up to us, we did too. The accommodations were better than in most hotels, as the house and our room, bathroom and sitting room were clean, plush and luxurious. We even had plush robes to wear and relax in. Our hostess prepared gourmet breakfast for us and spoiled us with attention and attention to detail. In the morning, we took our time visiting and relaxing over a hot steamed milk Nespresso, got great suggestions on where to visit and eat in Boston and how to get there, played tug of war with the eager-to-please darling Weimeruner Dallas. In the evening, we relaxed on the breezy and naturally lush patio with candlelight and skies above. The hostess was friendly and knowledgeable about the area and gave is great tips on Boston. The distance to the subway was very short, a good brief stroll away and we felt very safe there. We would come there to refresh and rejuvenate again - in a heartbeat!"
3166256,14589855,2014-06-22,13542925,Emily,"I requested to stay at Jess' s place as a reprieve from hostelling and told her that it was a treat to myself. Well, she sure pulled out all the stops! As a solo traveller it was so nice to be so well taken care of. On my way to Boston I experienced a number of delays and I was very tired from travelling, and Jess was really understanding and helped me a lot when I arrived. She is a very kind, caring and attentive person and she went out of her way to ensure my stay was nothing less than perfect. Her house is immaculate too. The bed is probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on, the guest area was lit by scented candles, I even had my own bath robe! It was the treat I wanted and much more. She makes a mean cooked brekkie too! The night after I stayed Jess came on a boat cruise with me and it was great to have her company. She strikes me as the kind of person who will interact with guests as much or as little as they like, which I think is very important as a host. I highly recommend Jess and her home! I will definitely be back. Thank you again!"
3166256,14751813,2014-06-25,16344415,Melissa,"Jessica's enchanting Oasis was even better than expected. The photos are beautiful but reality does not do them justice, you really have to be there. The beds were super comfortable, the house very clean (smells amazing!). Jessica has a talent for interior decorating. Her carriage house is a warm and welcoming place to relax after touring the sites. Waking up to a yummy breakfast and gourmet coffee tops the list; especially when you can enjoy it on her sunny terrace."

The dog was a peach. I didn't want to leave. I wish I could live there! But most of all aside from the frills and the fancies of this piece of heaven, is more importantly the angel that inhabits it. Meeting Jessica has changed my life. She is an inspiration, motivation, & fiery woman who will leave you wondering why you live so boring & excited to change.

Tastefully decorated and furnished. A real home with extra touches that make all the difference. Thick pile carpeted and finely tiled floors.  Authentic wooden furniture.  The bedrooms are very comfortable. Lots of space and plenty of storage. It's the little things that made the difference here: fresh cut flowers in each room; scented candles to welcome you home; chic soap bars and shampoo. Breakfast was a real treat.  Fresh fruit salads and freshly squeezed orange juice followed by a spanish omelette or eggs and bacon or bagels with large enough portions to satisfy our growing teenage boys."
Concerned about the dog? Don't be. He's well behaved and adorable.  The location is actually Dorchester in the immediate surburbs of Boston,but transport is great with the redline T just a 5 minute walk away and just 3 stops in to the city centre.  Jessica was also helpful when quizzed about local attractions.  We wouldn't hesitate to return.,,,,

The house is shared with the hostess, but we had an excellent privacy. Access to a hi-tech washing machine and a drier made our lives easier. We sat every evening for a while in the lovely patio to chill out after long days of work in downtown boston. But the best part of the stay is jessica. She takes care of you from the very moment you step out of the plane until you leave. Picks you up at the airport, prepares veeeery nice, huge and colorful breakfasts that include fruit salads, scrambled eggs and a couple of tomatoes or herbs freshly picked in her garden. Jessica was not a regular hostess to us. She quickly became more than that: a friend. We could talk to her about anything, any moment. It was an unforgettable experience to share your house, jessica.

Our stay at her cozy, with love arranged house was truly a great experience that will be positively and warmly remembered. Sharing Jessica's home was totally uncomplicated, we really were honestly welcomed. Like our son said: I am feeling like staying with a relative! Breakfast (fresh fruit, swedish pancakes and perfect nespresso and also the BBQ we shared with her were top-a-top, rooms were nice and comfortable, we slept like in Morpheus' arms there. We had our own bathroom, equiped with everything you need for a super shower... Jessica is open minded and we had interesting discussions sitting in her yard - looking in the garden. The rapid train is just some minutes walk - and you need just 5 stations to centre of Boston, very easy! Also in the neighbourhood you can find restaurants and a good bakery. If you are planning a visit to Boston, give Jessica's Shangri la a try - you won't regret it! Dallas - her dog - also was a nice company."

Great value.  It’s a nice way of meeting your long-lost cousin – one that is a gourmet cook and lives in a nicely decorated house,,,,,

The home is a very easy walk to public transportation (the T) which drops you off in downtown Boston in just a few short minutes.  Our breakfast was delicious and the bed was very comfortable.  We were not able to stay for breakfast the second morning as we had to catch a cab to the airport before sunrise.  Jessica left us a wonderful goodie bag of snacks for the long flight home.  We enjoyed our stay and it was lovely to have a \"\"home\"\" to return to after a day of touristy exploration"

She's quite amiable and easy-going, and a brilliant conversationist as well. We stayed two nights at the basement, which is private and warm enough even during the coldest weather. Also, we all love her dog, Dallas, very handsome Weimaraner. We'll definitely cone and stay at Veronika's again when we visit Boston."

Her place was gorgeous, the rooms comfortable and immaculate, we had breakfast waiting for us in the morning, and her dog Dallas is a lovable goofball. When I'm back in Boston I'll hope to be staying there again cause I just can't imagine having this much fun elsewhere :)"

Veronica's European background is clearly on display in every aspect of her home. She made me feel completely at home and did everything she could to make my stay as pleasant and trouble-free as possible. I would never hesitate to recommend Shangri-La highly  to anyone. Thank you Veronica!,,,,,

Our stay here was a nightmare. We’ve stayed at numerous AirBnb’s in 5 different countries and have never had a bad experience.  Until now.,,,,,
The host was rude,inappropriate,and had no respect for privacy.  Also,this is listed as an “Entire Place”; it’s not.   It’s a room in this woman’s house.,,
My husband and I were in Boston for business.  Our first night was without incident.  The host seemed friendly,if a bit eccentric.,,,,
On our second night,we came back to the house after a long day at a conference.  It had been pouring rain all day.  We were exhausted and eager to get out of our damp clothes and go to bed.,,,,
While taking off our wet shoes at the door,we were accosted by the host,who demanded to know why we hadn’t answered her texts (my phone was on silent from the conference).   She was incensed that I hadn’t responded immediately.,,,
Apparently there was some sort of leak downstairs in our room.  She discovered this while entering our space while we were out.  We’re not sure why she was in there,but we didn’t know she would be doing so and it invaded our privacy.,,,,
She was babbling incoherently about the leak for 30 minutes; we were unsure what was happening.,,,,,
She then became very domineering,making me carry bedding downstairs and ordering my husband to fix the bed that she had haphazardly propped up on a powerdrill (not sure why she had done this).  In the midst of this,she starts yelling at me about my slightly damp socks.  I wanted nothing more than to take off my damp clothes but she’d started ordering us around before I had a chance.,,,
She was so abusive that my husband finally spoke up,saying he didn’t appreciate how she was speaking to us,to which she responded,“If you want concierge service you should stay at a hotel”.,,
She was incredibly rude and acted as though the leak and ensuing chaos was our fault.  We felt uncomfortable and considered leaving immediately,but we weren’t sure how to find another place at that late hour.,,,,
Early the next morning,my phone rang while we were sleeping. I groggily answered the phone to the host aggressively demanding access to the room.  Before I could respond,she rudely hung up.,,,
We immediately gathered our things and left without brushing our teeth.  Our bus didn’t leave until 5pm,so we were forced to carry our luggage around Boston in the pouring rain because we felt so unwelcomed in her home.,,,,
Stay here at your own risk.  Based on other reviews,it sounds like she can put on a veneer of kindness.  But if something goes wrong,be prepared to be verbally attacked and harassed.,,,
Also,we LOVE dogs,"but this dog – while adorable – isn't well trained.  It kept jumping on us (it’s a big dog!) and twice barged into our room to try and eat our pizza. \"",,,
3166256,30181413,2015-04-19,10593073,Tim,Comfy bed in semi-private basement. Great breakfasts. Generous and friendly host and dog (all 80lbs of him). Walk upstairs to washroom. Everything was very clean.
3166256,30559218,2015-04-24,29539562,Michael,"When we arrived at the house and met Veronika, we felt that she couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating. The house was beautiful and decorated tastefully. It was very obvious that Veronika pays a lot of attention to cleanliness. I'm sure you could not get a hotel room this clean. The downstairs suite was very comfortable and private. Veronika says in her description of the house that you can have as much or as little of her as you want. We happen to think she was so cool, and very interesting to converse with, so we chose to hang out with her from time to time. We could tell though that she had a knack for sensing wether you wanted privacy or company, and respected our privacy completely when we needed it. We are also dog lovers, and her dog Dallas was awesome. I would have taken him home if she would have let me."
We are not breakfast people so I can't review that,we just have coffee in the morning,and she provided us with unlimited,delicious espresso,which we would enjoy on the beautiful patio. Veronika told us about a restaurant a couple of miles away. We drove there our first night,and couldn't find parking anywhere. So the next night she offered to drop us off there. We had a great dinner at Barcelonas.
As far as location,the house was within a few miles of everything we were interested in. We had a car,but I would recommend leaving it parked in the private space available at the house,and use public transportation or cabs and uber,as parking in Boston is very challenging to say the least.,
Thanks for a relaxing enjoyable stay Veronika!,,,,,

She is charming and attentive, and her lovely Weimaraner was amazing, intelligent and well behaved. We loved staying there, enjoyed her company and excellent breakfasts! Not only is Jessica/Veronika a gifted decorator, she is also quite a gourmet cook, with fresh and interesting flavor combinations enhanced with home grown fresh herbs and tomatoes. The little carriage house is charming inside and out, whether lounging on the terrace, or relaxing in the perfectly appointed downstairs suite."

3166256,33065869,2015-05-25,11723245,Ellie,"Firstly, what made the trip (not just the Boston leg but the whole holiday) was our host - Veronika is wonderful and absolutely hilarious! A close second is Dallas the goofy dog, we fell in love and if he wasn't so big he would have been coming back in our luggage! Her place is beautiful and I aspire to have a house as tastefully and uniquely decorated. She is a self confessed neat freak so the house is spotless - another thing I aspire too... The guest bedroom is perfect for hosting guests as it's self contained with a living room and you have your own bathroom up a flight of stairs. Veronika treats her guests like exactly what they are - paying customers, and details such as breakfast every morning, chocolates on the pillows, lifts to and from the station and her general welcoming attitude into her home make it worth every penny."

3166256,34625248,2015-06-10,28741367,Ragna,This was my first time in the US and I stayed at Veronikas house for a week whilst being at a conference in Boston. The stay had a major inpact on my time in the city and I would recommend staying with her to everyone. Unless you are allergic to dogs. Or fun.
The house is beautiful,with unique decoration and a lovely porch. The weather was really nice,so most mornings I would sit outside with my coffee and Dallas the dog (he is absolutely adorable and very well behaved). Veronika was very attentive to any needs and has an attention to detail,she gave me lifts to the conference centre and also picked me up from and took me back to the airport. She is also really funny and exceptionally easy to get along with!,,
The room I stayed in was downstairs,with an extra livingroom (with TV etc) next to it for me to use,but as the bedroom was so large I never used it. The bed was incredibly comfortable,which for me was a first,as I never sleep well in other beds than my own.,
We also had a bbq one of the nights; that woman knows her chicken with pesto! Delicious!,,,,,
So,to conclude,this was a very nice introduction to AirBnB and I would definitely recommend this listing!,,,

Veronika was an amazing hostess!  She definitely went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of and had everything we needed.  She picked me up from the airport on arrival,which was a huge help in getting settled in.  And during the first part of my stay,because I was leaving early in the morning,she even had a wonderful breakfast packed and ready for me to take on the run!  She was so helpful with everything,from helping us pick up a rental car and giving us directions,to letting us do a little laundry

Veronika was such a gracious host, including picking us up from the airport, making us feel at home, and also making us breakfast which was some of the most delicious breakfast of the entire trip (Veronika is an wonderful cook, using herbs from her own garden).  She truly nailed it from the beginning to the end of the trip."
The house was beautiful and well taken care of,along with a large front lawn and lounging patio access. There was a private bathroom and two spacious bedrooms available which made it easy to escape for naps and private time,although we much preferred enjoying both Veronika and Dallas' company (her lovely weimaraner) while we were at Shangri La.  Her home was also closely located to public transportation,which made it a breeze to commute to downtown Boston and other major attractions in just minutes.,,
I would highly recommend Shagri La to any airbnb travel and if / when I visit Boston again,I will not hesitate to make another reservation with Veronika and company... thanks!,,,,

I'm so lucky to meet Veronika who is a nice, kindly, warmth and optimistic lady. She helped me so much that   beyond my imagination. Her lovely dog,Dennis,and her beautiful house made our trip so exciting and fantastic . The house is so clean that I  always worried about how to keep it. Although our bedroom and dining room is in the basement, we did not feel any uncomfortable ,because the house has a perfect air system which makes the air in the house remain fresh all day long. Since the dining room and the garden are so beautiful, we spent very little time in our own room. There are no pictures of the outside on airbnb, so you will be surprised when you get there. The house is in a perfect block where local people live. It is beautiful ,quiet, peaceful and convenience to anywhere. Five minutes walk to T, to groceries, to restaurants and to the supermarket. Veronika made dedicate breakfast of the fruits and vegetables from her garden, so we can eat natural and organic food every day. I'm sure you must love here as long as you are not the person who is only used to that luxurious hotel. Here is full of love. Here is your best place to deeply explore the life in Boston."

We had a great time with Veronika as our host. She is very friendly, kind, and caring. I would recommend anyone traveling to Boston to lookup Veronkia on airbnb. Oh, and you can't forget about Dallas. Dallas was patiently waiting for us to return and greated us at the door every evening."

Especially in the beautiful porch and garden area. If you want the full Airbnb experience then don't hesitate to book, as you get that and much more.

The place is super clean and inviting, and the doggie, Dallas, loves everyone. Veronika got us out of a bind when it came to printing our Red Sox tickets and boarding passes. The short walk to the T (transit system) was easy to navigate.  We'd definitely stay here again - thank you for everything Veronika!"
3166256,46579378,2015-09-12,33843694,Michael,"\"This house was listed as entire home/apartment. This is a downright lie. This should be listed as a private room. We purposely NEVER choose any option but entire apartment to avoid the risk of staying with a \"\"host\"\" such as this."
Now onto whether Veronika made us feel welcome:  I experienced problems with the toilet flushing initially. Later on that night my wife experienced the same problem and this time the toilet overflowed. Without a plunger in the bathroom,we were left relatively helpless. Veronika's response was to scream and shout,"how could this happen and why we didn't use the plunger \"\"stored away elsewhere\"\" she went to another room to retrieve the plunger.  I would imagine the bathroom is a good place for a plunger and if she feel that it is not",she shouldn't complain when people can't find her hiding place for it. THERE WAS NO PLUNGER IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY!!!,,
And just a side note on this - toilets sometimes overflow,IT HAPPENS! It’s no one’s fault! If you want to have guests in your house,then THIS IS THE KIND OF THING YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH UNFORTUNATELY!!!,,,
On a side note the room which is in the basement is not connected to the toilet at all which happens to be upstairs next to the kitchen.,,,,,
After the bathroom flooded and the water stopped gushing out,she INSISTED that we clean and scrub the toilet flaws. Again,she shouldn't have even been there,but besides this,it is deplorable for a host of any sort to act in this way. So we actually cleaned that entire toilet bathroom - it was spotless YES -  WE CLEANED IT ALL UP OURSELVES ON OUR HANDS AND KNEES!,
We offered to have the mats cleaned to which she refused. She later made a claim for $150 from us.,,,,,
The following day we forgot the key at the house so when we got home later that evening (it was around 22:30) we had to call her to open,and she was SO rude,she had this terrible expression on her face,"didn't say hello/good evening (I mean this happens sometimes its no big deal again!!!) and she says QUOTE \"\"First the toilet and now this","its not looking very good guys\"\" and then just turned away and walked upstairs. WHY SO RUDE!!??! so unnecessary and uncalled for.",
The next NIGHT,"she decided to kick us out of her apartment after she went through out rubbish. As we got in to the house she said very condescendingly QUOTE \"\"I left a present for you in the bathroom\"\" and when I went to look she had placed our TRASH (that we had left in the trashcan) IN THE SINK AND INSISTED WE TAKE IT - This was absolutely RIDICULOUS! WHO DOES THAT? I mean this kind of treatment is absolutely disgusting and abhorrent.",,,,

A 10min walk takes you to the T stop which is 5 stops from Boston centre. Although it is not an entire home, which is clearly stated, it is also not just a private room. You have the privacy of the lower floor to yourself comprising a lounge and bedroom should you wish, whilst sharing the ground floor living area with Veronika and her loveable dog Dallas. She is a genuinely kind and caring lady who is rightly proud of her beautiful home. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if not just for the incredible breakfasts!"

She picked us up from the airport, and even took the liberty of making us very delicious breakfast meals every morning. Her place is very spacious and beautifully decorated inside. We were very comfortable with everything and it was simply perfect. She has a lovely dog named Dallas and he is the most friendly and adorable pooch you could ever meet.

3166256,50832587,2015-10-15,4294897,Zbigniew,"It is so difficult to write a review for Veronica. I know how important guests are to her, yet I would be dishonest to future users if I did not share my experience. Stiil, I was inclined not to write anything, but when she threw another unprovoked tantrum on the night before my departure, I truly had it."
I also know that V. reacts very unpleasantly to anything but high praise,so I am not going to read her reply.,,,,
1. Veronica. Very moody,"very bossy: \"\"this is my house and I am always right\"\". Really? Never mind her claim that \"\"Columbus discovered New England\"\"","but she THREW AWAY MY STAFF from \"\"my\"\" room when I was away and didn't even bother to tell me about it! Whatever it was (plastic bags I use for neat packing)",she had NO business doing this,obviously.,
Let's be honest: the old days of coachsurfing is not the same as airbnb. I paid her over $700,with the cost of perhaps $25 and can see no reason for her to be so rude. She also practices the reward/punishment policy: she did not approve of something I said,so there was no breakfast - which was just as well,as she insisted on serving what she thought I should like,not what I do.,
Also: made several promises/offers but got angry every time I took her up on them...,,,,,
In short: she can be very nice if you kowtow to her - but why should I? I am older that her,"am a university professor and pay her a lot of money. She keeps saying she expects \"\"respect\"\"",but shows none to others.,,,
2. Apartment. Spotlessly clean,even if my toiletries got rearranged every morning. But the bedroom itself is rather small and has no window,"so it gets stuffy. Only for the last night Veronica \"\"remembered\"\" to turn on a/c and blow some air to the basement. Also",she allowed me to do laundry,but only in the cold/cold cycle.,
3. Area. So-so. Partly rundown,but apparently safe. About 10' walk to the subway. If you need a taxi to go to the airport,Veronica knows a good company: $21 + tips is all. Taxi companies from Boston don't pick up fares in that area. One decent if overpriced restaurant and one all right coffee shop if Veronica decides you do not merit breakfast :).,,,
Funny,but all the time I was there I had a major problem with backpain. The moment I got to Logan,I could jump and dance: psychosomatic illness if there ever was one!,,,
So now,Veronica,time for your invectives and concocted stories,as in so many comments of yours. I'm sorry,though,"but I'm not going to read whatever you say.\""
3166256,51010014,2015-10-17,29454171,Carl,"Veronika was an incredible host, to say the least.  First, she allowed us to drop of our 4 very large pieces of luggage at 6:30 a.m. at her home 4 days before we were set to stay with her. (We had a 4 day stay in Nantucket, previous to being at her home and didn't want to carry all those suitcases on the ferry.)  When we arrived back in Boston, she met us at the airport, driving in heavy rush hour traffic. She not only made us delicious breakfast, she cooked us dinner both nights we were with her.  We had so much fun team cooking  and dancing with her to her great music mix in her lovely kitchen.  She even baked us an apple pie! At the end of our stay, she drove us back to the airport to catch an early morning flight.  The neighborhood was nice and quiet.  We had an short walk to the transit into Boston, which felt quite safe.  The bed and linens were top of the line, and the downstairs unit, where we stayed, was beautifully equipped with a comfy bed, couch, t.v., robes, extra blankets and pillows and travel brochures.  Veronika went well above and beyond what is expected of a great hostess."
3166256,51543750,2015-10-21,39596113,Philipp Stefan,Our stay at Veronica's place was awesome and probably the most unique Airbnb experience we ever had.
We don't know where to start: 5 star breakfast,large and cozy rooms to stay,or Veronica who is by far the most caring and open-minded host you can ever imagine.,,,
At the beginning we were a little bit biased due to a really negative review a few weeks ago. Now we know it is exactly the other way round: the room is awesome and romantic and Veronika is the exact opposite of rude. She cooked for us,gave us perfect recommendations and shares everything with us. It is like an entire home because we could use the entire space.,,,,
We can highly recommend staying at Veronika's and would definitely stay at her's the next time in Boston!,,,,,
Additionally,it is a really good deal for $125 a night not to say that you'll never get such a perfect place to stay and such an experience for that money.,,,,
Finally,"both thumbs up for an awesome location and the best Airbnb host we discovered so far.\"",,,,
3166256,52310931,2015-10-28,1336265,A Stone'S Throw (Diana & Chris&Marta),"We stayed with Veronika for 6 nights and had a great stay! Our first visit to Boston, Veronika and sweet pup Dallas, were so fun and full of Boston sass! Veronika goes above and beyond to make her guests comfortable in her home and even picked us up from the airport. Wow! Super clean, beautiful home in a historic carriage house. Veronika's house is a super easy walk to the Red Line train and it's just a couple stops to downtown. Would stay again without hesitation! Thanks Veronika and Dallas!"
3166256,52822535,2015-11-02,79716,Christina,"My husband and I are seasoned Airbnb travelers, we have stayed in NYC twice, San Francisco twice, San Diego twice and twice in Los Angeles, but this is actually the first time we have stayed with a Host and not rented the entire place."
I don't even know quite how to describe it. Veronika picked us up from the Airport and made us feel like we were a part of her family. We even chose to stay in for Halloween with her and her beautiful dog,Dallas and she cooked us our first dinner of fresh Lobster. It was a PHENOMENAL experience,and I now consider Veronika one of my very good friends.,,,
I can't recommend this place any higher! Clean,beautiful,lovely neighborhood,"easy to see all the sites. She took us to the train station to spend a day in Salem too! She's a fantastic host who takes pride in what she does. LOVE HER!!! Do yourself a favor and book her charming Boston home ASAP! We can't wait to return! 5+ Stars!!! :)\"",,
3166256,53080177,2015-11-04,47132925,Ben,"Veronika is a very great host.  She is opinionated and vocal about what she thinks, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I appreciated her directness and straightforwardness. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a warm and kind host with a beautiful home. Thanks for everything!"
3166256,53343660,2015-11-08,33277590,Sutherland,Veronika greeted us with a very warm welcome and made us feel as though we were home. Her friendliness and bubbly personality made the stay more than enjoyable. The place itself is located in a great location and was extremely clean and homey. We could not have asked for anything more! We definitely would come back and stay again and recommend it to all!
3166256,53685234,2015-11-11,4643903,William,"Veronika provided an accurate listing and provided a warm welcome into her home.  Per description she lives in the home and has a loveable dog in the home.  My stay included two bedrooms and three people total (my parents and myself).  We were provided with two comfortable bedrooms with a clean space, linens, towels, bathrobes, and more."
You can see in the listing that Veronika has an eye for the details in a space,and this is apparent throughout her house.  Definitely pick her brain if you have a desire to check out art in Boston.,,,,
Veronika provides a choice of hands-off or full service breakfast.  We opted for three mornings of provided breakfast - each morning slightly different and delicious (definitely better than the standard hotel continental breakfast).,,,,,
My parents fell in love with her dog,"and reluctantly left with Dallas staying behind.  Great choice if you love food or the arts - You can tell Veronika has a love for each.\"",,,,
3166256,54575390,2015-11-22,40643394,劉,It was a great time staying at Jessica's place. She is a nice lady and took care of us very kindly. Her room was clean and fancy! Wanna visit here again.
3166256,55781351,2015-12-06,6446335,Bonnie,"I had an amazing weekend at Veronika's Shangri la. The carriage house is as warm and inviting as she is. She picked me up from the train station, recommended a terrific local place for lunch and made me feel like a friend and not just a guest. The two room suite was so beautiful and relaxing with a bathrobe included! I honestly slept like a log! Her breakfasts are so delicious ! She was kind enough to drive me to the comicon I was going to twice! She lit a fire one night and we hung out and talked. i was so relaxed i fell asleep on the couch! Her dog Dallas was a sweetie! I would definitely stay there again!"
3166256,57213431,2015-12-23,46022870,Honghao,"perfect bed,perfect room,not a bad experience"
3166256,66212924,2016-03-20,1844707,Carrie,"From the moment I arrived at Veronika's home, I felt I had arrived at a second home. Both she and her gorgeous dog, Dallas, greeted me warmly. Veronika took great care to show me around her home and made certain I felt comfortable and at ease."
She provided terrific local insider tips on where and where not to go and when I arrived home that first evening,we sat around and chatted; I felt like I was spending time with an old friend. The next morning,after sleeping for 8.5 hours (unheard of for a mom of a six-year-old),I was treated to a sumptuous  breakfast: fresh squeezed orange juice,light-as-a-cloud scrambled eggs,Italian ham and crumpets with fresh butter. Divine.
How can I sum this up: Veronika is the hostess to rival all hostesses; she values her guests and respects their needs. Even rising at the crazy hour of 6 am to drive me to the airport,but not before handing me a freshly prepared takeaway breakfast to savour at the airport.,,,,
I had a fantastic time at Veronika's place; I highly recommend her,"the sweet and charming Dallas and Boston. Five stars all the way.\"",,,,
3166256,68328945,2016-04-04,45022872,Serenella,Veronica is an amazing person and a fantastic host. Not only
she made us feel like home but also she treated us like family. She cooked gorgeous breakfast for us (or packed it to take away with us if we needed to),picked us up at the station and offered to take us to the airport at the end of our stay. We were in Boston to speak at RSA conference,and Veronica even let us print our papers from her efficient wireless printer!,,,
We really enjoyed staying with her and her super sweet dog Dallas,listening to her stories and sharing some time with her.,,,,
The house is very well-maintained,quiet,and very clean. We used a private bathroom on the ground floor and towels+bathrobe were provided. We also washed and dry our clothes at her place (quick and painless!). Better (and far cheaper) than a hotel service!!,,,
Absolutely recommended to everybody,"especially business travellers like us. We would definitely stay there again!\"",,,,
3166256,69207891,2016-04-10,891502,Ronald,"You have Airbnb hosts and you have Veronika. She is one of the few that simply makes Airbnb great.. She really loves to spoil you and have you as her guests. Simply without any compromises. She even made me a breakfast to go when I have to leave early for a conference. Three days in a row, which mean getting up at 6:15.. Just awesome!! Her dog Dallas is as great as Veronika.. And she is always busy doing something in her house.. Even ask(forced ;)) me to help installing the new smoke detectors. No kidding, after spending days with her you want to do something back. The place downstairs is a great stay and from her it is just a five minutes walk to the red line which get you to all places in Boston. Thanks Veronika,  I will not forget this and probably not experience such an awesome stay.. We'll keep in touch!!!"
3166256,69741094,2016-04-13,60808693,Lynn,"Veronica is truly the hostess with the mostest! She met us at the car when we pulled into the driveway to help carry our bags in. She greeted us with a friendly welcome!  We felt like we were visiting an old friend!  We were given a tour of the home, and met Dallas-who is an absolutely perfect angel of a dog! When we entered our room, Veronika had placed on our bed a homemade card welcoming us, chocolates and our beautifully presented towels a very nice touch!  The house is lovely. Lots of charm! Just like the hostess. Veronika keeps her house very clean and it is also very comfortable. We stayed in the downstairs part of the house, Which is very comfortable, and private. There is an electric fireplace in the bedroom which was a very nice touch. Veronika made us a wonderful breakfast of fruit topped with an Italian cream that was delish and yogurt, all served on beautiful settings along with freshly squeezed Juice, and boy can she make a great cup of coffee! We spent 3days and 2 nights at Shangri La, we were sad to leave. We enjoyed our time in Boston, but We also enjoyed spending time with Veronika and Dallas just as much. I definitely would chose to stay here again. And I am hoping Veronika will keep in touch with us! Next time we will take her up on the asparagus omelet along with the fruit cup!  Looking forward,to our next visit! Diana and Dale"
3166256,70642787,2016-04-19,26561078,Jessica,Veronika was a very welcoming host and made us feel right at home. Her place is very tidy and she makes a fantastic breakfast!
3166256,71319862,2016-04-24,38456811,Jaclyn,"The space to ourselves was clean, quite, private, and lovely! The home in general is very clean and well decorated and maintained. Veronika is a very welcoming host and made us a delicious breakfast each morning. She will really make your stay special. I would definitely recommend this place."
3166256,72476241,2016-05-02,43239064,Marx,A wonderful experience in Shangri-la! We feel like home in our stay. The overall experience is excellent - there are a few things to highlight:
- airport pick-up by the host which is very hassle-free for visitors arriving after a (long) flight. Our flight was delayed till 11ish pm but Veronika still came to pick us up!,,,,,
- welcome surprise (better save the secret here),,,,,
- absolutely neat and clean! We have a high standard on hygiene and the place met our expectations!,,,,,
- delicious breakfast made with fresh ingredients which is what a bnb should be!,,,,,
It is a 10-min walk to the subway but it worths a walk as the neighborhood is quiet.,,,,,
"We will recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston!\"",,,,,
3166256,72740872,2016-05-04,64949997,Tomoko,"My work friend and I had a two night stop in Boston and we chose Veronika's lovely home.  As described in the listing, we were picked up at the airport, treated to a delicious breakfast, and relaxed in her beautifully decorated home.  Veronika was the perfect host, providing us with information and even packing a to-go breakfast on our last morning so that we could catch our Amtrak.  Her home is immaculately clean, very comfortable, conveniently located, and was just perfect for us!  We each had our own rooms, one upstairs and one below the main floor.  We really enjoyed our stay and time we spent with Veronica!  She gave us so much: tea to warm us up on the cold day we arrived and even a drive to the train station on our last day.  My  friend and I thought we got way more than what we paid for so thanked our wonderful hostess with a tip.  I would definitely stay here again."
3166256,73499949,2016-05-08,60837220,Maria Del Pilar,Veronika was nice and friendly. Very helpful and accommodating. We love the house and the neighborhood. Close to public transportation. We had a great time!!!

3166256,74955113,2016-05-17,37840211,Xueyiting (Sara),"This is my BEST and FAVORITE Airbnb ever!! 5 stars are not enough. Veronica is very sweet, nice and kind! She is the person who is happy when people around her are happy because of her. I feel blessed to know and become friends with her. My family love her and so do I ! Dallas is cute, we got along very well and after two nights, he listened to me, he is a good boy!"
The house is in a quiet,safe neighbor with 10mins walk to the red line subway which takes you everywhere in Boston. It is also 10mins walk to the bay and we really enjoyed our time relaxing there after visiting NYC. The entire house is fantastic,I fell in love with all the arts and decoration when we  arrived. My grandma kept taking pictures of the house. My family lived downstairs and I lived up. The beds in both rooms are super comfortable and we had a private bathroom which is very clean and neat! We felt at home when we stayed there.,,,
This was a real Airbnb experience to us because of Veronika's wonderful,delicious  breakfast and the best coffee I have ever had! I'm so glad I booked it and I will highly recommend to my friends who travel to Boston. I hope my reviews help you and don't hesitate to book her! Lastly,to Veronica and Dallas,we love you and we will go visit  you if we go to Boston again.,,

Les petits déjeuners étaient délicieux, elle était au petit soin pour nous. La communication était très facile, et si nous avions un besoin particulier, elle était tout de suite là pour y répondre. Veronika mérite vraiment son statut de super hôte. Nous avons fini notre séjour par son logement et nous en sommes très content ! Son chien, Dallas, est un amour. Merci encore Veronika pour votre générosité et votre bonne humeur !"
Veronika was a wonderful host . She was very understanding with our relatively poor English ! The breakfasts were delicious,she was fussing over us. Communication was very easy,and if we had a special need,she was immediately there to respond. Veronika really deserves its great host status. We ended our stay by its housing and we are very happy!

Her home looks so gorgeus, with so much lovely details and it's incredible clean. Our bedroom and a small living room were downstairs and our bathroom was at the main floor, with the big living room and the kitchen  (shared with Veronika). The rooms look really like the pictures and we felt very comfortable there. Veronika makes deilicious breakfast, really the best we had on our whole trip and she helped us with doing some phone calls, printing tickets and at least driving us to the airport.

A beautiful home, a host who puts her guests above all else and a dog who makes your stay even more memorable. Starting with the pick-up on arrival, the beautiful healthy breakfasts, the very comfortable bed and cosy downstairs apartment makes for a perfect stay. Thank you for a home-away from home stay.

She treated us like family and provided a wonderful alternative to staying at an expensive hotel.  Our accommodations were thoughtfully provided and lavishly appointed and we had a cozy media/tv room to call our own for our stay.  This was my first time staying with an AirBNB host and it was definitely a welcoming experience. Veronika went out of her way to make us feel welcome and even offered to pick me up after coming in on a late flight at Logan airport.

Her home is simply immaculate; the linens were not just cleaned but seemed freshly pressed--definitely not something I'd have at home. Hotel prices in Boston are outrageous; how nice to have such a nice alternative. My favorite part of staying with Veronika were her phenomenal breakfasts! She is a true chef--an artist, really. Veronika is extremely friendly and personable; she is very engaging, and I found myself wishing that I were there on vacation rather than on business so that I would have more time to speak with her. I felt torn between wanting to get some work done and wanting to chat. Dallas is a super friendly, wonderful dog--would have taken him home with me if I could! The neighborhood is in a great location--easily accessible to the T with a nice restaurant (224) and convenience store nearby in case one needs to grab a bite or forgets anything."

The neighborhood was safe--my daughter and I walked \"\"home\"\" from the T-station after dark without incident or feeling unsafe.  Veronika's breakfasts were amazing!  So delicious!!!  She knows the city well and her advice was always spot-on.  You won't regret choosing this listing.  \""

Clean, funky yet tasteful decor, and a comfortable space to sleep and hang out all add up to a beautiful experience. Veronika is an absolutely amazing host, and I can't heap enough praise on her (and Dallas)! Breakfast was a delight, and Veronika goes the extra mile to make guests feel welcome.

3166256,91398620,2016-08-05,7236047,Kathrin,It is said that Shangri-La is a fictive place – some sort of lost paradise located in Tibet in the Himalaya ...
We definitively don’t agree with that! We found paradise in Boston and even were happy enough to stay there for three nights ...,,,,,
The house is as beautiful and neat as the pictures show – fulfilled with an affectionate ambience. Veronika and her most charming dog Dallas received us very heartily. And what made us feel heavenly was that Veronika takes the second ‚b’ from ‘b&b’ as short for ‚breakfast’ ... But talking about her breakfasts it should be called a ‘b&mf’ for ‘morning feast’. A beautiful creation of flavours and colours!,,,,,
Veronika,thank you,that in the end of our trip through New England we could stay in your house. Very relaxed and happy to have met you and Dallasdog we flew back home to Switzerland.,,,

We have been inspired by the elegant life attitudes of Veronica, never to mention those fantastic breakfast that made us surprised over and over.  We have never expected be so close to a dog who can really understand you and Dallas was so quiet and lovely.  Shangri-La will be nothing but only a super surprise with your trip.

475259,85647092,2016-07-12,41202790,Nancy,"Francine's charming townhome is located in a very convenient location within walking distance to the best Boston has to offer. While the townhome was neat, it was not clean. The floors and furniture were especially dirty, however, we appreciated Francine's prompt response with sending housekeeping the following day. Prior to the next rental, the furniture should be steam-cleaned or recovered and a full deep cleaning (including air ducts) should commence. Two out of the three of us suffered with allergies from the overwheling amount of dust during the entire stay. The one television in the townhome is not working. Not sure if the remote needs batteries but one can't change channels. This was our first stay in an airbnb. If the townhome is fully cleaned, it is a great alternative to a hotel stay with easy access, ample bedding, and great location."
475259,87873531,2016-07-22,21152507,Megan,The hosts emails were very good and timely. Great neighborhood.
475259,91242422,2016-08-04,77733943,Robin,"Loved being able to check in before 3pm.  Lock box instructions fine, no issues.  Neighborhood and general location made it easy to walk places.  Town home as advertised on Airbnb.  Worked well for our group."

10734159,65664134,2016-03-16,57405352,Thanya,When I got the airbnb it was exactly what I had been expecting. Its beautiful cozy and perfect for 4 people. The aesthetic of the apartment made it feel like i already lived in Boston. Paige and her assistant were always in reach if and when we had any questions. I really appreciated that they let us drop our things off before the check in time. There is also an amazing rooftop view of the city which helped me fall in love with Boston. Overall it was an amazing experience and I would recommend this location. It easy to get to by public transit but also a very walkable area.
10734159,67016922,2016-03-26,54808633,Thant,Paige and her assistant we very helpful and responsive.
10734159,67280873,2016-03-27,44024588,Mj,"We did not get to meet our host, but she gave clear directions with the keys. The location was perfect, close to the Mass Ave orange line on the T and the description of the apartment was spot on from the pictures. As a whole, it was perfect for my parents, my boyfriend, and myself: there was privacy between both of us with the two bedrooms. We loved the kitchen and living room area and how it opened up all together."
10734159,68417685,2016-04-04,29714920,Julia,The apartment was in a great location near everything! Super clean and had everything set up. Check in was super quick and easy.

10734159,70818904,2016-04-21,48103405,Kristin,The airbnb was a great space and it was great having a few shops only a block away. Paige was very responsive to our needs and we really enjoyed our stay.
10734159,71218510,2016-04-24,64365330,Alex,The unit was very nice! It had a great location. Literally next to one bus stop and barely a 5 minute walk to the T.  The roof deck and views were amazing and there was a lot to do around the area. The apartment was furnished very nicely and had just the right amount of space for us all. Paige was very easy to work with to coordinate key pick up and I didn't encounter any issues during my stay.
10734159,73297314,2016-05-08,6356403,Desiree,The place is great and in the perfect location. Very clean and comfortable.

10734159,74403288,2016-05-15,55412005,Jason,Paige was a wonderful host. She answered all of our questions in a timely manner and made some good recommendations for places to eat. The place was perfect for our group. The rooftop patio was especially nice with a beautiful view of downtown Boston.  I would definitely stay here again.
10734159,75391626,2016-05-21,19090684,Shiqi,"This place is awesome! Everything is well-organized, and the neighborhood is very convenient. However, the overnight parking in Boston is so expensive. Next time I will definitely take public transportation rather than drive. There is a subway station near Paige's place within walking distance. I would recommend this place to my friends!"
10734159,75680493,2016-05-22,57914050,Sheehan,"Paige was extremely responsive and welcoming. Her instructions were clear and concise, which allowed us to enjoy our stay worry free.

10734159,79454627,2016-06-12,9167530,Jos,Paige is a great host! We received clear instructions about how to enter the unit and she was always very helpful and responsive (within a few hours).
The appartment itself was great and I liked it even more than the pictures promised. Comfy beds (rare at airbnb's),a fast,reliable wifi connection (citrix proof) and clean.,,,
Although we didn't bother that much,the non-master bedroom is located next to a very busy road intersection,with lots of claxoning in the morning traffic.,,,
Other than that,the apartment and location were great. Boston South End is an amazing neighborhood,which immediately felt like home. Copely Square is a 20 minute walk though parks and beautiful residential buildings. Also the lively neighborhood offers a lot quality restaurants.,,,
"Would definitely book again!\"",,,,,
10734159,81064901,2016-06-20,17314194,Alyssa,"Paige was friendly and super responsive. Apartment is in a great location and close to tons in the city. Way more spacious then you can tell from the photos, and a great place to stay!"

10734159,83873198,2016-07-04,27242531,Jenny,"Overall great experience. Convenience stores, pizza shops, restaurants all nearby or a quick cab away. Nicely decorated, extremely spacious and clean. Everything you would want from an Airbnb. Unfortunately, there was no roof deck access but there is a great view out of the back room window. Paige is responsive in a timely manner."
10734159,86097582,2016-07-14,42635223,Michael,Everything was perfect for our stay.
10734159,87983562,2016-07-22,21593578,Killian,"This was a great, very clean apartment in a great location in Boston. Really comfortable beds, well furnished, AC, wi-fi, nice kitchen area etc. Very close to a street full of great restaurants, and close to a Mass Av. station to take the metro into the city centre. Nice walk over the river, with great views, and then you hit MIT. Only issue was there was only one set of keys, I'm sure this could be easily sorted in the future. Would highly recommend staying here."

The location was fantasic as well--the neighborhood felt very safe and there were plenty of amenities, great restaurants, coffee shops as well as the train station nearby. The apartment's also conveniently located near Boston University and just a 20 to 30 minute walk away (depending on which end of campus one visits). Sanjay was very helpful and responded quickly to all messages when I first inquired about the booking right up until I checked out. I'd be happy to stay there again!"
6119918,33278873,2015-05-26,8851871,Rob,Good Airbnb. Close to the tran stop and local cafes. Would recommend.
6119918,33597631,2015-05-30,191450,Ali,"Everything in the pictures is accurate. The apartment was sleek and modern, which fit four people (two couples) very comfortably. 5 stars, will definitely recommend."

Sanjay made it easy for check-in and out, and provided a private parking space if needed. Very convenient to shopping, dining, and the T transit in Brookline. Would use again!"
6119918,36583731,2015-06-29,7000138,Brock & Kim,Good location near the T. Parking lot was being paved while we were there so we couldn't use it. Everything is finished up now though.
6119918,38019908,2015-07-12,32155654,David,"Sanjay was very responsive from first contact I had with questions about the unit all the way through to questions I asked after arriving. We had a smooth check-in, even though we had to arrive late."
The apartment is in very good condition and had all the amenities that Sanjay advertised. Location is very convenient with an easy walk to two MBTA stations plus has an off-street parking space,a nice perk being so close to Boston.,,,,
We used the apartment as a home base to visit Boston each day and it was less than 30 minutes from the front door into the city using the Green line.,,,,,

Close to the T and very easy to get to BU and downtown. Sanjay was very helpful, this was our first AirBNB experience and he helped me and made it a great."
6119918,39015652,2015-07-20,13032030,Mark,"Great little apartment for a weekend visit to the Boston area.  Place was extremely clean is is like a hotel as the owner does not live at this residence.  There were fresh towels, lines and plenty of space.  There is NO cable or broadcast tv so you will have to enjoy the complimentary netflix on the apple tv.  I felt very safe in the neighborhood and used Uber a few times to get downtown."
6119918,39643088,2015-07-25,36089373,Scott,"Sanjay's place was great! Easy to find, very clean, and within walking distance of a lot of great neighborhood spots as well as easy access to the T green line. For our first Airbnb it was a fantastic experience."
6119918,40162453,2015-07-28,38822370,Nathan,Super clean and quiet. We walked to station each morning to tour the city of Boston. We saved a little money by making our own meals we purchased from Whole foods.
6119918,40468564,2015-07-31,6176871,Pauline,"We had a very good time in the appartment of Sanjay in Boston. Unfortunately the toilet did not work very well, but Sanjay tried to arrange a plumber (although he had a very busy time with his wife who was in labor!). In the end it did work. The appartment is not very big for 4 persons and actually 2 more chairs would be very nice, but it was clean and tidy, had a nice kitchen and we had a very good time. The pool was also very nice."
6119918,42282004,2015-08-12,16822148,Bhavana,We did not meet Sanjay but everything was the way it was described . We enjoyed our stay . The place was clean and close to many sites.

"There was plenty of space for us as a family (2 adults and a 5 year old).  We swam in the pool attached to the property.  The train stop was close by with easy access to the city.  We were able to have a great time in Boston.  We highly recommend this apartment.\"",,,,,
6119918,43266129,2015-08-18,34691450,Wilfred,Sanjay made us feel welcomed.Got locked out twice. He came and let us in
6119918,45470126,2015-09-03,5667799,Jenny,"We enjoyed our stay at Sanjay’s. Plenty of space for two of us and a lot of luggage. Kitchen had pretty much all the amenities we needed to make breakfast every morning (though no microwave as listed). Laundry isn’t “in unit” but across the way in another building; but the facility is kept up way better than laundromats. Parking was easy. Since it was a bit warm and muggy in Boston while we were there, A/C was a godsend and it was nice to take a cool dunk in the swimming pool. Most of all, we appreciated that Sanjay’s place was CLEAN, TIDY, and QUIET!"
6119918,46935302,2015-09-14,10871915,Tracy,"Quiet and friendly neighborhood, the space was exactly as described, and communication was great with Sanjay. Convenient to downtown Boston via car, T, Uber, etc. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Sanjay!"

"I highly recommend Sanjay's place It's right in the heart of Boston\"",,,,,
6119918,48887203,2015-09-29,7364068,Larry,Sanjay was very accommodating. He was able to let us check in a bit early and checked on us to make sure we had access to everything.
6119918,49683251,2015-10-05,44349757,Linda,"The location is great, being near our daughter's apartment. The only tricky part is finding public visitor parking on the street. It's possible, but takes some patience. During the week it would be particularly difficult."
6119918,50145001,2015-10-09,464044,Corey,The apartment was well appointed and in a nice location.
6119918,50358658,2015-10-11,40802588,Matteo,"L'appartamento è ampio, spazioso e esattamente come da annuncio. La posizione è buona, e il quartiere residenziale è molto silenzioso, anche se è indispensabile muoversi con i mezzi per raggiungere zone turistiche o di attrazione di Boston (circa 15-20 min di tram dal centro, ci sono 3 fermate abbastanza vicine); c'è un parcheggio privato a disposizione."
Purtroppo la comunicazione non è stata molto puntuale ed efficace: pur avendo scritto diverse volte tramite airbnb prima di partire,non abbiamo mai ricevuto risposte / messaggi (solo la conferma della prenotazione senza nessun testo); un giorno prima dell'arrivo,è stato recapitato un SMS (con le indicazioni minimali su come entrare in casa) sul mio cellulare da un numero che non era quello indicato su airbnb; ho risposto a quel numero,ma ancora nessun feedback. Alla fine,siamo riusciti a sentirci via SMS usando il numero indicato da airbnb. Purtroppo in casa non era disponibile alcun tipo di comunicazione (es. wireless,numero assegnato per il parcheggio

The apartment was extremely clean and well maintained, and includes an off-street parking spot. Sanjay was very responsive and helpful, although there were no problems with the stay. I recommend Sanjay and this apartment without reservation. Thank you, Sanjay!"
6119918,51483673,2015-10-20,9652744,Julie,We had some difficulty with communication in a timely fashion- this was true on both sides.
The apt is very sparse but clean.,,,,,
There was no coffee- even though we were warned about this and came with our own,it would have been a nice touch to have had coffee and milk stocked.,,,,
The beds were comfortable,even the sofa bed.,,,,
We had problems getting the heat on even though we were told the heat was on in the building,it did not come on during our stay no matter how much we fiddled with the thermostat.,,,,
We used the apartment for a family event so we did not explore the neighborhood.,,,,,

I feel lucky I was able to get this place on such short notice. The bed and bathroom were great, the kitchen supplies were well stocked and the whole place was very clean and well taken care of. We did find a microwave and coffee grounds available in the kitchen when we got there, and there was other small details that made the place very welcoming. Sanjay was very hands off, which was great, but he also was readily available when we reached out for assistance. Would definitely try to get this place again if I was visiting the Boston area, highly recommend!"
6119918,55189559,2015-11-29,316450,Anonymous,"Our host made us feel welcome. The neighborhood was great, easy access to Boston U and Whole Foods.  Two problems did surface -- the first night we had no heat so it was a really, really grim cold night. After consulting with our host the second and third nights had heat and were great. The second problem was one of the layout of the  apartment - great for two people, not so great for our three as the third person sleeping on the couch had to go through the bedroom to reach the bathroom."
6119918,57246164,2015-12-23,8550336,Chris,"Place was great, would definitely stay again."

the only problem we encountered was the heating unit.  It was only 62 degrees inside the apartment when  we arrived  and it was definitely chilly outside,especially for us because we live in Florida.,,,,
However,Sanjay was very helpful in obtaining a heating company to come look at the unit late in the evening.  Sanjay himself even came over to see if there was anything he could do to help with the heat.  He offered to bring in space heaters if needed and for us to call him no matter the time if the problem with the heat could not be solved.  He even offered to help us  move to another unit if necessary.  The repairman was able to improve the heat for us but,,,,
the baseboard heater in the bedroom made a loud squealing noise every time the heat kicked on.,and it was worse during the nite,but we managed,even though we did not get much sleep.  It took about 12 hr for the apt. to finally warm up and thankfully it was warmer outside so we did not need as much heat.  Overall it was a quiet,nice place to stay. Having access to movie channels on the large screen TV was a plus.  Sanjay was very polite,"accommodating to our needs and did everything he could to make our stay pleasant.  I would recommend this Airbnb for hospitality  homes to use for their clients.  \""

Sanjay was great to work with, he answered my texts with questions promptly. Location was perfect for me and lots of shopping and stores near by. Loved the nespresso maker too. Thx so much for a pleasant stay!!"
6119918,66577037,2016-03-23,58796178,Charmaine,Sanjay was super hands off but was always reachable via text/phone. There was some confusion on my part about getting into the apartment but he was  incredibly patient and helpful throughout the process. The place itself was cosy and well resourced and in a very nice neighbourhood. Would definitely consider staying again!
6119918,67296431,2016-03-28,23232818,Kyung,"Sanjay was very helpful in finding the place and explaining what's around. Everything was neat and tidy when we got there. It has got everything we needed, parking lot, comfortable bed, big TV, etc. It took us some time to figure out how to work the lock but it was okay once we got it. The neighbor is really quiet and the place is very accessible from T. We extended our stay for two more days but the maid came into the apartment without knowing that we were staying extra days, so that was a bit awkward."
6119918,70680252,2016-04-19,45171523,Colleen,"The apartment was clean and met our needs.  Entry instructions were clear.  The neighborhood was nice and we made good use of the convenient public transportation and Whole Foods and B Fresh grocery stores.  We greatly appreciated the espresso machine and a couple of extra hours beyond checkout to conveniently take a shuttle to the airport, maximizing our final day in Boston. Sanjay was very responsive to our inquiries."

6119918,80437904,2016-06-18,3065350,Simone,"I spent five nights here, on a work-trip in Boston, and I have a good sense of the place."
To begin I would stay here again. So minor complaints are mere yuppie problems.,,,,,
The good:,,,,,
1. It's super clean and smells like home.,,,,,
2. It's in a safe quiet neighborhood that's walking distance to Whole Foods.,,,,,
3. There are two coffee makers. One standard and a fancy a Nespresso.,,,,,
The (not so) bad:,,,,,
1. The were two frying pans,but not pots for boiling water. Since I stayed there for work,I wanted to cook. I had to resort to boiling pasta in the large frying pan.,,,
2. Check in was sorta confusing. Instead of a regular lock and key for the apartment door,there is a key pad. I didn't realize how to work the keypad at first. I checked in a night and couldn't see that well. But once I figured it out,it was smooth sailing.,,,
3. There is a nice large TV that has no Cable. Stuck with Netflix and Apple TV. So I just watched shows on my iPad.,,,,,
"Overall I would recommend this place!!\"",,,,,
6119918,80652506,2016-06-19,5523795,Erin,Sanjay and his apartment were wonderful! He put together a detailed list of instructions/recommendations that he made sure we received several days in advance. He was also very responsive when we arrived and had a last minute question about keys and the entrance. The apartment was exactly as pictured - super clean and just what one needs when staying in Boston for a couple of days. It's also well located for those looking to enjoy Brookline and not be right in the mix of downtown. Definitely recommend!
6119918,86724808,2016-07-17,62696042,Lisa,Sanjay was great. Always got back to me in a timely fashion. Place was perfect. Pool was great. Everyone was very nice to us. Exactly what we were looking for while visiting Boston to see the world's greatest band Dead and Company!!

We particularly appreciated the private entrance, the dedicated parking spot, the nice soaps and shampoos, and the pool.  Sanjay sent information about the area which was very helpful.  The kitchen amenities were sparse but functional.  A previous guest had made off with a cooking pot and when I texted Sanjay that there was no pot, he brought one by immediately.  I will definitely book again when I come to visit."

We did not know the Regatta on the Charles River was the same time as our planned stay in Boston, which made finding hotel rooms a challenge.  Luckily Bill has a place that could accommodate all 6 of us.  Bill's place is very nice, clean and comfortable.....and looked just like the pictures.  We appreciated use of the spacious living room, big TV and kitchen to store our personal snacks. The continental breakfast of Panera Bread pastries and fresh brewed coffee was a very pleasant start to each morning."
Bill was also very helpful in providing information on local areas (e.g. Vietnamese community in Dorchester area),including suggestions on using the T line.  Access to the washer/dryer was a plus,and much appreciated,because some of us had already been traveling for a week before arriving at Bill's place.   Lastly,Bill providing parking spaces for our rental cars. Anyone who has visited Boston knows parking is a challenge.,

The house didn't have a whole lot of kitchenware but we were able to manage with disposables.  The location was perfect- walk-able to bus and train lines.  There is an apartment underneath the house with a tenant, no real issues with it other than the cigarette smoke coming from it at night.  Overall, the place was good for our stay in Boston."

*Boston is an amazing city. Do consider visiting and exploring.,,,,,
*My family had a place to lay their heads and gather together during my graduation weekend.,,,,,
*The house offered an affordable price in an expensive city.,,,,,
Cons:,,,,,
*Internet was inconsistent. No manuals on how to use TV,internet,or house alarm system.,,,
*The street in front of the house was littered with discarded chicken bones and other detritus.,,,,,
*The house did not have expected amenities...or even some basics. Items missing included: basic cutlery,bottle opener,drinking glasses,zero pots and pans,dishwasher detergent,enough towels
(By the second evening,Kensley provided plastic cutlery,styrofoam cups,paper plates and extra towels. We were grateful for that,but we never did get any pots and pans,which led to us having to eat out and bring food back home. This negated some of the cost-saving incentives for choosing a low-priced airbnb.)

I am dumbfounded, however, to have received a call from Shawn saying that the TV is now missing from the unit! The neighborhood certainly isn't the best, but is familiar to me, and therefore I felt fine staying there. To remedy this situation in the future, the company may look into having keys made that cannot be copied (ie: key is engraved with \"\"do not copy\"\"). I have no idea if someone previously copied it or what"

There is a convenience store and Dunkin' Donuts near the house,so we could satisfy our appetite quickly. Also,a station is near,so we could move cheaply and it was very convenient!,,

We never met but I felt he was always there if needed. The location was perfect, directly across the street from the subway system which took us everywhere we needed to go. Within 10-15 minutes from downtown. Other places that were close that we visited were Sam Adams brewery, house of blues, Fenway park, Freedom trail. As for the apartment itself it was very compact for the 6 of us that stayed there, especially with 4 females. The bedrooms were very small. We didn't have dressers in our room so we had to pick out of our suitcases our whole stay. There wasn't much to do directly near our place, had to take the subway to go everywhere but again everything is a short distance. All in all I think the location and Shawn's helpfulness made up for the outdated/cramped apartment."

Shawn seemed very nice and was great about getting back to us regarding the location, keys, etc.  We recognize (since my son lives nearby) that it is an area with lots of noise and that cannot be helped.  That is city life!!!!  If you are light sleepers, this may not be the unit for you but if you want accessability to any area in downtown Boston, it is great."

We were disappointed that some things were not working, the television, lightbulb in bedroom, not enough metal cutlery for four people or glassware. The apartment was very near the subway which was goods it meant it was easy to see the sights in Boston but it also meant it was noisy late into the night."

When we realized we didn't have washcloths, he promptly delivered them by the following day. The apartment is in an older building but the renovations in the unit made it feel updated and comfortable. We LOVED the convenience of being across the street from the red line, which made it easy to come back to the apartment in the middle of the day to take a break (or nap in our case). The dining area had seating for 4 so it was a little tight for our party of 6, but it didn't cause a problem since we seldom ate at the same time and could always overflow to the living room area when we did. There was a little street noise we could hear from the front bedroom when the corner bar closed, but it was not bad and didn't last long. Overall, it was well worth the value and we enjoyed our stay."

4196643,43600416,2015-08-21,25533059,Gillian,Shawn was a very helpful and pleasant host. We had a problem with the dishwasher not draining and whilst he couldn't get the plumber to fix it during our short stay there was one on the way!  The appartment is small and compact and for six of us it was a bit of a squeeze but was ok for 2 days.  It is well located with the subway across the road and its a short trip into the city. It was also handy to have the shop across the road which is well stocked for basics.  I would definitely recommend this place but more for a family or group of four people due to there being 3 double beds and you need to be able to share beds if you are a sixsome! The key system was also very easy to access unlike the one in NYC! And we loved the enormous fridge!

Mit Ausnahme des Wetters war alles andere wunderbar.,,,,,
Shawns Wohnung war sehr sauber und gemütlich. Die U-Bahn-Station direkt gegenüber vom Haus.... problemlos konnten wir alle Boston-Highlights erreichen.,,,,,
Perfekt für einen Kurztrip ! Sehr zu empfehlen !,,,,,

4196643,50103264,2015-10-09,42728249,Agnes,"很好的房子,适合3-4个人旅行,床很宽大很舒服。离哈佛和MIT大概20分钟的车程,离市中心更近。"
4196643,50732882,2015-10-13,45286226,Qinghan,The apt was great. It was comfortable and quiet. Perfect location. Shawn was really nice. I texted him around 11pm and he relied soon.
4196643,51692960,2015-10-24,27779820,Teresa,The communal area will make any initial visitor feel uneasy as to what the apartment is going to be like. But don't be put off as the apartment is perfectly fine. It's well appointed and clean. It certainly met the needs for the 5 of us. It's a great location for exploring Boston as the underground is right across the road. I would say if you have a car don't expect to park as the available streets are always busy and street cleaning means cars need to be moved or they will be towed.
4196643,52350285,2015-10-28,45764325,Tiffany,Shawn was very helpful and quick with response. The place is spacious and clean. There wasn't much coffee or creamer.
it's next to a busy street,they picked up the trash around 4am and the fire alarm batteries were low and it was beeping all night.  Some of this was the dumb luck of staying that specific night. overall I would stay there again,"just not on a Monday.   I believe if I would have sent Shawn a message I am sure the coffee and the fire alarm would have been addressed but I was in Boston for a conference and was very very busy.\"",,,
4196643,52458618,2015-10-29,47283516,Angel,Left private feedback to the host.
4196643,53382587,2015-11-08,44703193,Eva,Nice and clean apartment with an amazing connection to the red line subway. Perfect for a weekend trip with friends or family.
4196643,54467810,2015-11-20,19032424,Sebastien,The location is great just a step away from the T station. Apartment was clean. Internet was working. Everything went as planned. Thanks
4196643,55210524,2015-11-29,12665159,Clémentine,Good expérience. Very close to the subway. Nice apartment. Thanks a lot for those days !
4196643,55460405,2015-12-01,6176580,Thomas,"Perfect Apartment for our quick stop in Boston. As has already been said, the shared entrance probably doesn't entice, but the apartment is as described and perfectly suited our needs. Shawn was responsive and provided clear check-in instructions so it was as hassle free as you could ask for. If travelling with a crowd its location is super close to town less than $10 in an uber to the centre of town. I couldn't ask for more. Metro across the road and a little store next door for the essentials. Thanks Shawn!"
4196643,55936998,2015-12-07,13755729,Brendan,"Wonderful stay at a nice, clean home. Shawn is a great host!"
4196643,56301657,2015-12-12,33100574,Sophia,"The apartment in Boston was clean and in a convenient location. Parking was difficult because the area around there was all for permit holders, we ended up getting ticketed."
4196643,58258979,2016-01-02,31823643,Steve,The apartment was a little misrepresented the kitchen floor is badly in need of repair and the bathroom smelled like urine ! Probably not the place for a family to stay more of a place for a few college kids to stay in while partying in Boston ! Parking is an absolute nightmare! Definitely should be mandatory to highlight the bad as well as the good in pictures so people looking to rent can make better informed decisions ! Also there was a broken dishwasher on the back deck not something I would leave at my own house let alone a house I charged people to stay in ! But Boston is a great place to visit we will be back just next time I will spend the extra money on hotel rooms !
4196643,59802274,2016-01-15,26170397,Francesca,Had a great stay!
4196643,66848616,2016-03-25,15336346,Gideon,"We had a great stay. Shawn was attentive and helped with any request we had. The photos gives the immpresion that the apartment is a bit bigger and fancier than it really is. That being said, it was nice, clean and cared for."
The Apt is located not far from down town but I can not say it is one of of Boston’s best neighborhoods. We arrived at night and at first sight the area seemed a bit dodgy. However,next morning we felt much better,safe and comfortable to walk around..,,,
Definitely a good place to stay when in Boston for a visit.,,,,,
Thank you Shawn.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4196643,68190632,2016-04-02,7954985,Steve,"Our family of 4 stayed with 2 adults, 2 kids stayed at the apt for 4 days in late March.   The apt has a promise and could be a great space.  We dislike having to give a negative review, but to be honest the negatives outweighed the positives."
The positives:,,,,,
- good layout with 3 bedrooms,kitchen,living room for space,,,
- the host was readily available to answer questions and resolve issues,,,,,
"- the \"\"T\"\" stop subway and mass transit is quite literally acrosss the street and extremely convenient to downtown",colleges or airport,,,,
- uber drivers nearby because of the subway,,,,,
- Wifi and cable tv are excellent,,,,,
- new towels,,,,,
The negatives:,,,,,
-  The cleaning service clearly did not have their best day as we found dirty dishes in the dishwasher,some dirty clothes in dressers,and a bathroom tub that we cleaned before use.   A few corners in rooms were bad,"but it was \"\"relatively\"\" clean and not a complete disaster.",,
- avoid bringing a car,parking is challenging.,,,,
- The building is past the point charming,its simply run-down.  The common space in the entry rugs show wear and tear,the electrical system looks aging with ancient outlets and light switches that need replacing even though the host replaced a few lightbulbs for us.   Outlets are scarce and are quite old.  Counter appliances can be used only one at a time with a single outlet .,,,
- Lots of cosmetic drywall problems with crooked walls,uneven ceilings,half painted paneling /half drywall,holes,places for towel bars and closet rods that were missing,etc.   Unfinished repair job with duct tape instead of drywall tape in the bathroom.
- Unfortunately painters were overenthusiastic and paint was everywhere,hitting light switches which should have been replaced,trim and on spots on the new wood floor,,,
- Beds sagged and creaked for us....any movement. New mattresses needed?,,,,,
- no extra linens or blankets or kitchen towels,,,,,
Some TLC and good contractors (a drywall contractor,professional painter,electrician) could get the place in shape.   But as it is,its not quite up to snuff.,,
Interestingly,"one of the other renters \"\"Steve\"\" in Jan 2016 mentioned that it was more of \"\"place for a few college kids to stay\"\" which is our experience","as its not quite up to our standards.   That same renter mentioned an old dishwasher on the back porch which is still on the back porch and not removed as of Apr 1. \"",,,
4196643,75754860,2016-05-22,25602009,Jennifer,"We stayed here for my graduation and it was just what we needed. All 6 of us were pleased with the location and the apartment. Parking during the week is a little challenging but once the weekend hit there were no problems! Everything was clean and we felt safe, so no complaints here! Thanks for your hospitality Shawn!"
4196643,76487448,2016-05-27,9424237,Jim,"Good value, especially during graduation week at many colleges in the area, with hotel rooms expensive and scarce. Apartment was clean and well appointed as described in a reasonably safe neighborhood. Host was great- very responsive and answered questions immediately. Cons: overnight parking difficult; best solution was to park illegally and pay $25 ticket. Since we were traveling with two 87 year olds and a 91 year old, climbing the 20 or so stairs was challenging. Front entryway quite dingy, carpet needs replacing. No air conditioning, but windows opened easily."
4196643,78152335,2016-06-05,48862732,Bruno,Shawn foi simpático e atencioso conosco. O bairro é calmo e possui estabelecimentos comerciais próximos. A descrição do anúncio é compatível com o que encontramos lá e a casa é ótima.

"Thank you Shawn!!\"",,,,,
4196643,81029880,2016-06-20,69872445,Tien,"Overall excellent stay in Boston! House was on the older side but clean and functional. High ceilings, for those who want to know. Once we got used to the gas stove and set up the toaster and air conditioner right, had no further issues. Great location at walking distance from subway (literally visible from the window), groceries and shopping, and quaint neighbourhood. Host answered messages in a timely manner and have clear instructions. Would definitely recommend this rental to others!"
4196643,82133139,2016-06-26,35597992,Kristie,"We had a wonderful time at Shawn's place.  It was very cozy and had a nice Boston feel.  If you are going to Boston with a larger group, it is a great place to stay  to feel at home in the city."
"Thanks Shawn!\"",,,,,
4196643,83533661,2016-07-03,8737221,Bora,Host's message regarding how to arrive and all the other details were pretty clear. The place was really clean and easy to find. Public transportation is just around corner and the neighbourhood doesn't feel unsafe. I was travelling with my parents and my brother. All the rooms and beds were pretty comfy. Kitchen is fully equipped so we had breakfast at the place every morning. I would happily come back and stay here again. Thanks Shawn...

"Note: The apartment was advertised as \"\"Harvard MIT\"\" but it is very far away from those areas. I recommended this be removed from the description for future renters.\"",,,,,
4196643,94947880,2016-08-17,27198566,Birgit,"we stayed for two nights, the subway around the corner is very convenient. the apartment is small but had everything we needed. The kitchen would have needed some extra cleaning - the table and area around the sink were greasy despite the high cleaning fee we payed."
5125723,27936757,2015-03-15,4858328,Chris,"I had a great weekend at Spiro's place! I was there for a short weekend for a research conference and the 1 BR place was just what I needed and such a good value. He was very accommodating in meeting up and dropping off keys and was in frequent contact to make sure the stay was going smoothly. The place itself matched the description well and was in an ideal area. It's in a fairly quiet neighborhood but also close enough to walk to a lot of major attractions. Overall, many other places were far more expensive for a smaller space and I had a wonderful stay here."
5125723,29705328,2015-04-11,22264837,Tal,"Great place, location, and overall stay in Boston.  Spiro was an excellent host!"

The kitchen is small but was just right for us.  There is a lot of natural light and a nice cross-breeze when all the windows are opened.  All wood floors in a classic building!"
5125723,30925719,2015-04-29,20559141,Bin,"I stayed in Spiro's apartment for two nights for a workshop in April. Sprio's apartment is very clean and organized, also pretty laid-back. That actually makes you feel quite like at home. The apartment is very conveniently located, walking distance withing Northeastern Univ. MIT, with lots of stores and restaurants. It is also very close to the T station to and from the airport."
Spiro is a very friendly host,"so I definitely recommend his place to stay.\"",,,,

5125723,40740667,2015-08-02,25577255,Nikolaos,I stayed at Spiro's flat for 1 month. He was very friendly and show me some places that were very helpful to me. He also offered to take me out and even bought me some drinks. The whole time Spiro was available for me through phone and would take care of anything that i wanted. Overall the flat was clean and everything was as described. Also the neighbourhood was very quite full of students as 2 colleges were very close. The location is very convenient and near the centre of boston.
5125723,41819276,2015-08-09,35381603,Chris,"I had a fantastic experience at Spiro's apartment. He was very accommodating about both my arrival and departure, and everything was very easy to arrange.

5125723,44435568,2015-08-26,8897012,Blake,"My wife recently spent two nights in Spiro's place. He was a great host. Communication was easy and he was there  when she arrived to let her in, even helping to carry a heavy bag. He is very personable and offered helpful suggestions. His place is small but lovely, very clean and comfortable, perfect for a couple. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The location was perfect for her stay, since it is a five minute walk to Boston University where our daughter attends college and close to a metro station. We hope to stay there again in the near future."
5125723,45602390,2015-09-04,40626890,Francesca,"The apartment was in a great location, close to a major supermarket, places to eat, and two different T stops.

I would stay here again if I needed to!"
5125723,46755226,2015-09-13,10981872,Rob,"I had a great experience staying at Spiro's flat.  The location was perfect - close to the conference centers, plenty of restaurants and nightlife nearby, and totally safe.  The apartment is just as described - it was very tidy and it had everything I needed.  Spiro was a total pleasure to interact with - he made the coordination of key pick-up/drop-off very easy and he was more than happy to answer any questions I had and was very responsive.  When I accidentally left a couple of items in his place upon my departure, he was quick to offer to place them in the mail.  What more can you ask of a host.  I would definitely recommend Spiro's place for a nice alternative to the expensive Boston hotels.  Until next time Spiro!"

5125723,51281355,2015-10-19,8535596,Teresa,"Spiro's apartment is an amazing value in the trendy and high-priced Back Bay area, where hotels easily go for $300 a night and higher. It is located on a quiet street just steps away from the restaurants on Boylston and a 5-7 minute walk to the shops on Newbury.  T stations are also close by.  The apartment is very clean, featuring hardwood floors, a leather sofa, comfy armchair and comfortable bed and is equipped with everything you would need for a short stay. Spiro was an exceptionally considerate host, lugging my luggage up a couple flights of stairs for me and checking in with me halfway through to see if I needed anything. Highly recommended!"

We're sorry we didn't have much time to hang around with him because of our busy schedule. The room (and the whole apartment btw) was nicely decorated, it was very spacious and cosy, and the location was excellent as well - just a hundred yards from the nearest orange line T stop.

Although there is no A/C due to the house being old, it was not hot at all even on the 90+ degree days.  I would easily recommend Sean and his Air B&B."

13110347,90365745,2016-07-31,66504818,Prashanna,Sean was extremely friendly and hospitable. His place was cozy and very airy. It's proximity to the Stony Brook subway station was an added plus and it was very convenient to commute to Boston from there. Would definitely recommend this place.
13110347,91096480,2016-08-03,69907969,윤영,호스트도 정말 친절하시고 집 옆에 바로 역이 있어서 다니기도 편합니다!!

13110347,92263607,2016-08-08,6057813,Marissa,Great location right off the T. It had the cutest the little back patio with tons of flowers. The room was also very quint. Getting the key was easy. I would recommend to a friend.
13110347,93333823,2016-08-12,16183323,Christian,"Sean was a wonderful host. Everything was as described. This was a perfect base to visit Boston, 2 minute walk to the T station and you are in the centre of Boston within 15 minutes. The neighbourhood is also interesting and pretty. You can walk 20 minutes and you are on Jamaica Plain high street where there are nice restaurants. The room was very clean, as was the bathroom. We would definitely stay here again when we come back to Boston."

"N'hésitez pas !\"",,,,,
13110347,94907613,2016-08-17,54592083,Andrea,We had a lovely stay in Boston @ Seans flat & were most comfortable - It's the perfect  location as you're 2 mins to the station & 15 mins into the city  - We arrived very late @ night but provision was made by Sean to collect the key & not disturb other guests - The rap around balcony garden was a bonus.

13110347,96354333,2016-08-22,29226361,Francesca,Sean's apartment is amazing - full of eclectic and interesting things - in a beautiful part of Boston. The room was comfortable and Sean very helpful and friendly. We really enjoyed our visit.
13110347,96887148,2016-08-24,17821626,Roanne,"This place was a great for us, we really felt at home the moment we walked in! Sean's place was in a very nice neigbourhood where you can easily spent some of your time just walking around or drinking coffee. This neigbourhood was also easy accessible from the city centre; 20 minutes by bus/metro and very easy by bike. The room and bed were comfortable, the kitchen had lots of pans (so we cooked for ourselves), the bathroom was clean and there was a balcony. In short: highly recommended."

J'ai apprécié mon séjour chez elle et y retournerai sans aucun doute! :),,,,,
Cindy welcomed us perfectly,she is very nice. She answered our questions very rapidly when needed during our the whole week-end.,,,,

I have many positive things to say : Actully it is my first experience, however it was awesome :))) and in a case I will need short term housing I will not think twice I will contact Cindy again..Cindy she is great host, she gave me nice, clean, cozy, well furnished, warm room in well equipped house. Cindy's house, very special in all of the aspects!!! All the roommates were also students at MIT or Harvard or MGH, great calm neighborhood and nice area, this house centered in very special location, very close to T Bus, lovely cheap supermarkets (Stop & Shop, Dollar Tree, HomeGoods, etc), the wireless internet worked very fast, the house supply many services and they came and clean it very frequently. Something I must say Cindy were very helpful and easy to communicate and she helped me a lot, since it was my first time in Boston, God bless her. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND Cindy's house, don't think even just book it! and I hope to see you there once..enjoy your time :), Shady"

4294835,22717746,2014-11-12,1703326,Teresa,"Cindy was a wonderful host.  I visited Boston with my sister to tour the city and see my son at BC.  She was prompt in her responses, courteous, and helpful.  The rooms in the downstairs area of the house were clean and nicely appointed.  And, the location is close to the T, the bus, and downtown Brighton."
I would highly recommend Cindy’s place to other travelers,,,,,

4294835,22815942,2014-11-15,7975236,Sanah,"Cindy's place was a short walk from St Elizabeth's, where I had an interview. The room was cozy and comfortable and Cindy is flexible about check in/out times. She herself is pleasant and helpful. I'd come back if I'm ever in the area again!"
4294835,24195791,2014-12-22,9853874,Alexandra,I had a nice stay in cindys place but I'm not sure if I will go back. I mean that the price is a little bit expensive for what you get. The place is 45 minutes far away from downtown and the place was not 100% clean. Still I have to say that Cindy is really nice and she allowed my boyfriend to stay with me for 2 nights with no extra charge.
4294835,25169718,2015-01-08,10800846,Tsukasa,"I stayed at Cindy's place for 2 weeks and that was amazing. Though I arrived there on Christmas night, Cindy and her daughter helped me carry my luggage and gave me all information about the house. The room was pretty clean, comfortable and really warm(in spite of cold winter in Boston). The location is a few minutes walking away to the closest bus stop and  I could reach both downtown of Boston and Cambridge easily. If I have a chance to visit Boston again, I'll definitely stay there. Thanks, Cindy."
4294835,26210042,2015-02-07,24492952,Magaly,"It was a very nice stay, Cindy was a great host, helping in everything that she could. The room was nice and comfortable, and the house is located in a great area."
4294835,29674737,2015-04-11,28588977,Tatsuhiko,I really liked Cindy's place. It is exactly what is described. The location was very convenient to commute to the Harvard square. My first experience in Airbnb was more than great.
It is highly remarkable that Cindy is a very experienced host. She gave me necessary and sufficient information and instructions both before and after arriving. I was convinced of this fact when I found some universal adapters installed on the electrical outlets. Cindy knows what travelers need.,,,,,
I strongly recommend Cindy's place to everyone,"including those who have not used Airbnb before and want an experienced host.\"",,,,
4294835,29791918,2015-04-12,28588977,Tatsuhiko,"I had a great stay in the room, which was exactly what is described. Plus, the location was very convenient to commute to the Harvard square."
Furthermore,it is particularly worth noting that Cindy is a very experienced host. I was convinced of this when I found some universal electrical plug adapters installed. As I expected,she gave me necessary and sufficient instructions both before and during my stay. She knows what travelers need.,,,
Thus,I highly recommend Cindy's place,"especially to those who have not used Airbnb before like me.\"",,,
4294835,30318461,2015-04-20,3776320,Federico,"Cindy is very kind. Her big house is comfortable, although the basement bedrooms don't have any window. It is situated at a walking distance from the tramway station. 30 min away from downtown is sometimes too long for a tourist, but I should say that the tramway service is quite regular and works until late. A nice place to stay in Boston!"
4294835,30537067,2015-04-23,21334683,Carolyn,"Perfect, clean and cozy. I appreciated the ease of access and the room being nicely set up."
4294835,30965364,2015-04-29,19346532,Grace,We stayed at Cindys for one night..
The room is as you can see in the images. It is impprtant to point that it does not have any window,but for a short stay it works super Great!. Very clean and the heating works as you need ir.,,,,
The kitchen is very large and other hosts gather there from time to time.,,,,,
We never got to meet her but were always in touch. We were having trouble to contact her by phone,beacuse of international dialing,but Cindy always was very available and prompt to answer by message. She gave us easy instructions to get to her house and how to reach our room. This was really practical and also it was super fine not to need to bother anybody,"we felt free to arrive at anytime.\"",,
4294835,31879901,2015-05-11,26049274,Adam,"Cindy's house is in a great location, with easy connections to Harvard and Longwood, and some excellent restaurants and bars just down the road at Union Square. Downtown Boston is a bit further, but still easily accessible on the T. It's clean and spacious, and there are usually a few other guests around to socialise with. Free coffee and cereal is a bonus. The room itself is clean and comfortable, although as a basement room without outside windows, I can imagine getting quite warm in the summer! Cindy kindly provided a fan, though. She's a very thoughtful host, and this room is great value for money in a lovely area. I'd certainly consider coming back when I'm next in Boston!"
4294835,33785504,2015-06-01,29534289,Sue,"Cindy is a great host. Very welcoming , friendly and helpful. Our room was confortable and cozy. And the house is located in a great area close to everything and walking distance to everything. We had a great experience.  Would go there again!"

4294835,36527193,2015-06-29,3220598,Selina,We stayed 3 nights in cindys house. It was a bit outside of boston but well accessible by bus or metro. Cindy was very very kind as she organised and paied for the taxi as we arrived late in the evening and went to a wrong place. She is very caring and looked very well after us!
4294835,36731322,2015-06-30,4948360,Jessica,"I had great stay at Cindy's house. The room was clean, cool, and exactly as described. Cindy gave great directions to the place and responded quickly to all of my questions. I would definitely recommend staying here."
4294835,37015492,2015-07-03,7693370,Susie,"Cindy was a really helpful host considering we booked on short notice. The space is no frills but comfortable and reasonable given the price. Our only concern was the lack of natural light in our room and proximity to the furnace. Location wise there are some good local restaurants & bars, and the distance to Back Bay/Downtown is fine if you're happy to jump on a bike or train."
4294835,37463727,2015-07-07,8734514,Emma,The host was very welcoming! The bedroom and bathroom were clean and well provided. We were able to use the kitchen and cook for ourselves. It was a lovely place and in a great location next to the T buses and trains.
4294835,39711450,2015-07-25,6967646,Soumya,"The room was great, though it was a bit difficult to locate the actual building as I arrived pretty late (10pm) and it was dark. Parking is a bit tricky to find if you are there on a Thursday night as one side of Cambridge Ave has its cleaning schedule that night."
Everything about the room was perfect- the bed was nice and comfortable,"there were towels available for me in the room. Also there is plenty of storage space in the closet. The bathroom was tidy as well. The kitchen upstairs is also nice and there was cereal and milk available. I just stayed for one night and I think this is a great place to stay. Also Cindy makes sure that everything you need is there in the room or around the house.\"",,,,

4294835,40779687,2015-08-02,91989,Joanna,"We appreciated the upgrade during a heat wave to a less hot room with a fan and a half-bath but no A/C. Convenience to T was good. The place seemed clean but the crusty bits on the pillowcase and outdoor cigarette butts / smoke coming through window were slightly unexpected. The room was good otherwise and the host was helpful, fine for a short stay."

The shared bathroom was again clean and had everything necessary. The room itself was in the basement, but it had good ventilation and air-conditioning. Upstairs in the kitchen there were cereals and coffee left for us."

Just notice that it is a semi-basement room so no windows there, but the price counts, the dehumidifier works well and overall it is a nice place to sleep in such a pricy boston area."

Had 0 issues at all. only about a 5-7 minute walk to the Allston St T stop or about the same distance to the 66 bus stop and more. If you're hungry the Allston Diner, Grasshopper, Roxy's, Spikes and Fomu are all within walking distance.  there's also a CVS and Walgreens a stones throw away. I stayed in room 3, only advice I can give to any future guests is to make sure you set your alarm in the morning as there are no windows so you can never really tell what time it is by guessing haha."
"Thanks Cindy.\"",,,,,

I was doing a rotation at a near by hospital and had long hours. It was very quite and perfect place to crash at the end of the day. I would be happy to stay here again.
4294835,66361714,2016-03-22,49722186,Chris,"I was happy with my time with Cindy. I wasn't around at all during the day so I was mainly around to sleep, but the house was nice. The people I met were very nice. Cindy was a nice host. I didn't see her much due to my circumstances, but when I did see her, she was very nice and is willing to talk if you would like to and will let you be if you don't. She also has a small dog (Minny/Mini) that's a sweetheart. No worries though, the dog is harmless. Overall good experience."

We never met Cindy,  but she gave us clear instructions to the place and it was pretty easy to find. She also kindly provided complimentary coffee/tea and cereal/oatmeal in the morning! The room was clean and it look exactly like the picture. The bathroom, however, was not as clean. The shower curtain was a bit old, so it was hard to close the curtain."
4294835,68648484,2016-04-06,19835474,Chelsea,The night I spent at Cindy's was great! She was easy to get in touch with to coordinate check in and check out times as well as making sure I could drop off my suitcase before the check in time.

There were bananas / Keurig coffee set out to help the morning! The room is in the basement along with two-other spaces and a shared bathroom. Everything was clean and fresh - especially the linens. But the lack of a window felt a little disorienting. For a nights sleep this place is quiet, dark and cozy!"

Après plusieurs nuits d'hôtels à NY et Niagara falls, c'était un vrai plaisir de terminer notre voyage à Boston en logeant chez elle.

4294835,79163345,2016-06-11,53733596,Kate,"Cindy is very hospitable and welcoming. I very much enjoyed chatting with her about Boston and things in general. She always had coffee pods and various pantry items available for guests, including my favorite cereal which she even bought an extra box of after I mentioned to her how much I liked it! She was very easy to reach via messenger and was quick to respond. I found the place to be exactly as described and good for the price and location. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're looking for a comfortable bed in a private room in a funky little part of town. I would not recommend it if you aren't comfortable with having lots of roommates. I shared my floor and bathroom with two other rooms so it can be a little loud, especially if you're a light sleeper like me. I feel that Cindy was very open about this being a private room in a shared space so I knew what to expect and was comfortable with the arrangements."

Beth especially goes out of her way to provide all the necessities and then some. Awesome location in the heart of Little Italy/North End. Room was clean and we both slept very comfortably. Our next trip to Boston will hopefully include a stay here again! As others have mentioned, this is a room within a church, but that was no issue whatsoever and we enjoyed the privacy and extra living space that allowed. Close to the Blue 'T' line and within walking distance of many restaurants and monuments. A true 5 star stay!"

13107648,89035857,2016-07-26,63392116,Jeanne,"We spent 3 nights staying at Beth's apartment and only have great things to  say.  The description and photos are right on.  Beth provided lots of extras in the room and bathroom such as snacks, coffee, tea and lots of toiletries, if needed.  She stayed in touch with us during our drive from Pennsylvania and our stay in Boston.  Great restaurants and lots of history are within walking distance.  My only regret was we didn't meet Beth face-to-face, but I'm looking forward to doing so on our next trip."
13107648,90235013,2016-07-31,69358306,Henriette,"Beth hat uns das Gefühl gegeben, absolut willkommen zu sein! Sie hat auf alle Nachrichten sehr schnell geantwortet und hat per SMS Kontakt gehalten. Sie hat uns eine genaue Wegbeschreibung zur Unterkunft, Tipps zum Frühstücken, Essen gehen und Insidertipps für die Stadt gegeben. Sie und ihr Mann sind sehr herzlich und offen, sodass man sich rundum wohl fühlt."
Die Unterkunft war genau wie angegeben. Es war alles sehr sauber,es gab einen Kühlschrank mit Getränken,eine Mikrowelle und kleine Snacks - perfekt,wenn man abends spät ankommt!,,
Die Nachbarschaft ist hervorragend für einen tollen Urlaubseinstieg,überall gibt es leckere italienische Restaurants,kleine Supermärkte und der Freedom Trail ist direkt um die Ecke,"der einen an allen Sehenswürdigkeiten vorbeiführt. Boston ist von diesem Standpunkt aus super zu Fuß zu erkunden!\"",,
13107648,93216404,2016-08-11,76224558,Sara,Beth's location is amazing. Lots of great food right down the street and close to the Quincy Market. Room has everything you could need and plenty of space.
13107648,94286962,2016-08-15,27677715,Julia,"Beth est une hôte très accueillante : disponible, elle prépare votre arrivée a l'avance, pendant le séjour elle s'assure que tout va bien et se montre très arrangeante, notamment pour garder les bagages après le chek-out, pour la lessive, etc. La chambre est extrêmement bien située, au coeur du quartier italien de Boston avec tous les restaurants à proximité (très utile car il n'est pas possible de cuisiner sur place, il y a une machine a café et un frigo pour le petit déjeuner mais pas d'évier/cuisinière/micro-onde). La chambre a seulement une petite fenêtre qui donne sur un autre immeuble, elle est donc très silencieuse mais aussi très sombre. Elle est très propre et convient parfaitement pour une famille avec deux enfants. La salle de bain commune est également très propre."
13107648,95422661,2016-08-19,77186769,Sylvia,"Beth exceeded expectations when it came to this stay! She was always making sure all of our needs were met to make it a very comfortable stay. The location is ideal right in the best part of Boston. It was an easy walk to great food, many popular sites and public transit to easily get around Boston. The location was also quiet despite the many popular locations around."
The rooms were just as pictured and described. The rooms were nicely set up and clean for when we arrived. The room set up was ideal for my husband and I and our daughter.,,,,,
The common space and bathroom was also kept clean through our whole stay. It was nice to have a common space to hang out and eat. Beth was nice to provide us with coffee and tea as well as other refreshments.,,,,,
Staying at this place made our trip to Boston a fantastic one.,,,,,
"Highly recommend!\"",,,,,
13107648,96416711,2016-08-22,30362896,Dylan,"Staying with Beth was awesome! Check-in and check-out were nice and easy, and the place was cozy and clean - plenty of room for two travelers. As explained in the listing, the bathroom is shared, but it really wasn't a big deal. As far as location goes, this place is perfect: located within the heart of the North End, and within walking distance to most sights around the city."
"Would love to stay with Beth again - thanks!\"",,,,,

8934599,74946404,2016-05-17,64638559,Carl,Todd var enligt mig en pålitlig och trevlig värd som alltid var snabb att svara på frågor samt väldigt tydlig med instruktioner om hur allt fungerade med lägenheten. Allt var precis som det skulle helt enkelt!
8934599,75473414,2016-05-21,29920385,Duy,This is my first time using Airbnb and Todd house is exceptionally fine with great location. The interior design is quite nice with great beds. Todd is also a nice host that response to all of our inquiries pretty fast. I would recommend Todd to whoever planning to visit Boston.
8934599,76864578,2016-05-29,5612162,Asad,"Dealing with Todd was very easy going , he stayed in touch thru and thru! The place was very clean and very homely !! The only thing I thought we were kinda cut off from the main town , but having breakfast at the breakfast club around the block kinda fixed all the blues for us ;)"
8934599,77909255,2016-06-04,61516428,Martin,Todd was an awesome host and the place was extremely clean and well maintained. I booked this place for my parents and siblings on a trip to Boston and they were genuinely impressed with how home-like the place felt. Todd was always on hand to quickly answer questions and even allowed us to stay a little later on check-out day because of a late afternoon flight. Would definitely recommend Todd and this place to anyone visiting Boston.
8934599,88757961,2016-07-25,17699375,David,Tods House is a nice Flat with a lovely Veranda in the backyard . It was super clean and comfortable. It is 10 Minutes away from Harvard University and next to some grocery stores.
8934599,92506992,2016-08-08,4324927,Abdulaziz,Todd is an amazing host and made our stay wonderful by the late check out since our flight was late at night. Clean rooms and bathroom.

Situated in a very pleasant and quiet district, the closeness of T and shops, is very practical. We were very easily able To discover the city. Brooke is one host very attentive, whose help was precious throughout the stay. One very thank you to all her family. I recommend you her welcome without any reserve"
Notre séjour à Boston a duré une semaine. L'appartement de Brooke est confortable et charmant. Placé dans un quartier très agréable et calme,la proximité du T et des Commerces est très pratique. Nous avons pu très facilement découvrir la ville. Brooke est une hôte très attentive,"dont l'aide était précieuse au cours du séjour.Un très merci à toute sa famille. Je vous recommande  son accueil sans aucune réserve.\"",,,
12463555,76003629,2016-05-24,10954808,Erika,My friends and I had an amazing stay at Brook's! We were fortunate to meet Brook and her adorable family before we left. She told us how to get around and even drew us a map. The home was very clean and cozy. The neighborhood is wonderful and has plenty of restauraunts and cute shops within walkig distance. We were able to walk to the orange line and get into the city easily. I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during my short trip to Boston. THANK YOU BROOK
12463555,76994754,2016-05-30,60125045,Kathie,"We just returned from visiting in Jamaica Plain.  Brooke's home is literally minutes from great restaurants and interesting little shops.  Though we did not meet (we arrived very late on Friday night), Brooke is a lovely host.  She checked on us to make sure we were settled in and asked for us to let her know if we needed anything during our visit.  The bed was super comfortable.  There were soft towels in the bath, fresh flowers and lots of books.  Thanks Brooke for making us feel so welcome."
12463555,78273430,2016-06-06,71878690,Martha,"We enjoyed the apartment very much, and it suited our needs. The location was excellent and convenient for traveling into Boston. Thanks for your quick responses to our questions, and for the flexibility on checking out."
12463555,83337745,2016-07-02,75865855,Keith,"Location is great: $40 taxi from airport, 10min stroll to the orange line into the city which takes a further 15mins, excellent bakery 2mins around the corner and a selection of 'boutique' shops and restaurants too."
The apartment itself is fairly compact but was adequate for a family of 4 (kids 7 &4),we spent our days and evenings in the city so it suited our needs.  This was our first AirBnb experience and we didn't quite appreciate what we were getting into - we were slightly surprised to find food in the fridge,dishes in the dishwasher and clothes in the wardrobes - we found this a little unsettling but this is our issue and in no way a reflection on the owners. We brought and used our our linens,but what was supplied was clean and would have been just fine. The main bed was really comfortable and the kids had no complaints either.,,
The owners were fantastic throughout the experience - super quick with our pre-booking queries and kept a constant but unobtrusive dialogue during our stay just to make sure we had everything we needed to make the best of our trip.,,,,,
"If you are planning a city break in Boston I can highly recommend staying here.\"",,,,,
12463555,92334361,2016-08-08,86957000,Yaxing,"The listing description is absolutely accurate. Brooke made the bed for my daughter very nicely. She also gave us very flexible check out time. We love the neighborhood. It is close to shopping, restaurant., and 10-15 minutes walking to T station. Very convenient. There is also a playground for kids not far from the house. We will definitely come back again for our next visit to Boston."
12463555,94531728,2016-08-16,10657244,Daniel,"Logement idéal pour un séjour sur Boston. Appartement super bien décoré et équipé, dans une maison typique. Très bien situé également à proximité du métro. Seul bémol nous n'avions pas les codes Wifi et comme notre séjour était organisé par internet cela nous a fortement pénalisé."
7281884,39692227,2015-07-25,36664180,Mary Kate,"Tyra was an incredible hostess! She was very flexible with scheduling and meeting with us. Her space was clean, comfortable, and in a great location.

7281884,40011682,2015-07-27,38113753,Karine,"Tiree and Carlin received us perfectly. They were listening to our questions and were very generous of their time. Tiree even lift us to the Fenway Park for the Red Sox game. We felt comfortable in their appartement. If you want to cook, be aware that there's no stove, only a microwave. The neighborhood is nice. You feel the old Boston vibe in the little    street they live in. If you want to go downtown, plan 40 minutes by public transport and 10 minutes by car. We realy recommend this place. Thanks Tyree!"

7281884,41136459,2015-08-04,37575279,Denys,"Accueil très sympathique et patient (nous étions 2h en retard) de Tyree, qui nous a de surcroît donné un plan des transports en commun et les horaires des bus. Le studio est tout à fait confortable, propre et conforme à la description. Il se trouve au dernier étage de la maison de Tyree, mais bénéfice d'un accès privatif qui permet d'aller et venir à son gré. Tyree, qui était sur place, s'est montrée très disponible et joignable à tout moment, et nous a également rendu service lors de notre départ vers la gare."
L'équipement pour cuisiner ne se compose que d'un micro-onde et d'un réfrigérateur,il n'y a pas de plaques de cuisson,et peu de vaisselle. Bien que très accessible,notamment en bus,l'appartement est un peu plus éloigné du centre ville qu'on pourrait se l'imaginer (les bus ne sont pas toujours très fiables,nous avons parfois mis 1h30 pour rentrer depuis downtown- à moins de prendre le taxi
7281884,41485060,2015-08-07,36944625,Jonathan,"For our first time with airbnb,  Tyree made everything easy. Really nice host, made us feel at home. The place was well located, very clean, charming indeed. You cannot go wrong with Tyree."
7281884,41544790,2015-08-07,40440188,Attiyah,Tyree was an amazing host. She gave me tips for getting around the city and offered me 24 hour help/advice. I felt at home from the moment I entered the studio. The unit is very secure (three locked doors to pass before entering). Everything was clean and as pictured. The location is easy for public transportation with several bus stops near by. The neighborhood has a very quaint old town feel. It was just a great experience overall. I would definitely stay again!
7281884,41694947,2015-08-08,23990507,Dominic,"Clean, comfortable accommodations in an historic neighborhood.  Tyree was very helpful."

The place is just like the pictures: clean, quiet, and very well maintained. It's a good location and a quick Uber to most downtown stops."
7281884,42586300,2015-08-14,5208640,Francois,"We had a very nice time staying in this lovely studio. The place was perfect for us and quiet. It is a little off-center but it was easy to get downtown by bus / subway (about 30 min). Tyree is a great host, always there to answer our questions and she made sure that we had everything to enjoy our stay with our 2 children."
7281884,42784047,2015-08-15,8080455,Karen,"Tyree was a perfect Air BnB host, very responsive, friendly and accommodating. Her nicely maintained, homey apartment in this close-knit, quiet, residential neighborhood was like being with family. It was just what was needed for a quick business trip to Boston, a great alternative to a pricey hotel.  :-)"

For fellow travellers: Getting around in Boston - for us the easiest way was with bus and bike! (hubway) Driving is ok,but parking downtown is a real task!,,,,

7281884,45124183,2015-08-31,39752103,Kathleen,Tyree made us feel comfortable in the space.  It was pretty much as expected from the description.  She responded quickly to our request for paper towels and provided snack foods as well.   Her next door neighbor was very friendly and helped us navigate around a festival that was going on nearby.
7281884,45490594,2015-09-03,32797741,Sarah,Calvin saw us get out of the cab and helped move our bags to the side of the house where Tyree met us. They were both welcoming! The big historic house is in a cul de sac in a beautiful predominantly African American neighborhood. Tyree said people on her street are mostly educators and artists with families. It's a beautiful place and felt very dynamic and homey.
7281884,45798739,2015-09-06,38854070,Jesenia,"Tyree was very welcoming! Always quick to reply and offer any suggestions. Her studio was very cozy, perfect for a little getaway. The stairs might kick your butt a little, but it was very nice."
7281884,46152920,2015-09-08,26473060,Kancana,"Our stay in this studio was great. The studio is airy, with a lot of natural light. It was clean and just like the photos suggested. The side entrance allowed for privacy and was easy to access. Tyree was there to greet us and was easily accessible over text throughout the entirety of our stay. She made sure that we had everything we needed and went out of her way to even leave us extra snacks and such. The neighborhood is quaint and quiet. It's a nice getaway from downtown but very accessible. We used Uber to get to and from of downtown and all rides were under $10. It was a great first AirBnb experience."
7281884,46300341,2015-09-09,6414748,Tiffanny,We loved our experience. The host was easy to work with and very sincere. The unit was beautiful and as described. We will keep this property in mind when planning our next trip to Boston!

7281884,47694846,2015-09-21,11369264,Lene,"We spend 2 days at Tyrees, and enjoyed it a lot. She was very accomodating, gave is a few tips on the trains and busses, even though she was on her way out when we arrived quite late. The studio is located in her house, but we never heard anything from her nor her family. The studio was clean, and nicely decorated, with a modern feel. She had left sodas ND water in the fridge for is, and tea and coffee on the table. The area was nice, but to be honest, we didn't  explore the local area much, we went straight to do down town."
7281884,48185804,2015-09-24,29464900,Helen,"Tyree was an excellent host, going above and beyond what she needed to do eg printing out game tickets and Carlin carrying our suitcases up the stairs. The flat was comfortable, with all we needed. It was convenient for central Boston either by Uber or public transport  (bus+train in approx 30 minutes)."
7281884,48416731,2015-09-26,5565731,Paul,"This is a very nice apartment and an excellent value ... especially for a pretty expensive city. Tyree is a very attentive host, and she was careful to provide parking for us right in front of her home. Parking is a scarce commodity in Boston, so this was very thoughtful on her part to make a space for us."
The apartment is spacious,comfortable and nicely appointed. The stairs leading up to the apartment are high and pretty steep.  Not a big issue,but it's worth mentioning.,,,
The neighborhood appears to be safe. However,there don't seem to be any cafes or diners withing easy walking distance when you're looking for a nice breakfast. Also,the best option for transportation into the downtown area is Uber. The nearest T station is far away. And riding buses takes too much time when you're on vacation.,,,
In spite of these minor complaints,This spot is a great option for a single or couple,and it's a great value for anyone visiting  Boston for a short,"fun visit. \"",,
7281884,49006651,2015-09-30,40634714,Sugandha,Me and my friend stayed at Tyree's place. We really enjoyed the experience. House was beautiful as shown in pictures in a great neighbourhood. Tyree welcomed us and shared information on how to get around and she was always available for any help we needed but also respected our privacy.
She even offered us a ride to the subway. The location is well connected to downtown and the house was equipped with everything we needed for our (URL HIDDEN) I would give it a 5 star rating.,,,,,

7281884,49114699,2015-10-01,21569364,Jan,Tyree made us feel right at home.  The space was a perfect little studio to start our trip to Boston and up the coast.  Super clean and loved the TV.

She was very friendly and welcoming and went out of her way to make sure we would be comfortable during our stay. The studio was very clean and spacious. We felt safe in the neighborhood and it was conveniently close to all of the things we wanted to do while we were in Boston. I would definitely recommend her home for others planning to visit Boston and would love to stay there again the next time I go back!

But the best thing is Tyree herself! Even though we didn't meet her personally,she impressed us with very detailed descriptions,"free drinks in the appartment and a mail response time of seconds! Highly recommended :-)!!\"",,,
7281884,49887712,2015-10-07,24018421,Dan,"The place was clean , exactly as pictured, and nicely appointed.  Tyree and her husband couldn't be nicer people, her husband made sure I had a ride set up when I got in.  The neighbors are nice as well, and the private entrance was great."

7281884,51284000,2015-10-19,7460387,Andi,"Everything about this property and experience was wonderful! The historic Roxbury/Dorecestor neighborhood is safe and clean, the house is lovely, and the studio is gorgeous - even better than in the pictures! The art and the view make it extra special. Sparkling clean and still comfortable. Tyree is a perfect host. She greeted us when we arrived and made it clear she was always a phone call or flight of stairs away. Wifi worked great. Lots of yummy snacks and drinks were ours for the taking (we took!).  Shortly after we left the studio, Tyree called me to let me know I'd left some papers that were actually quite important. She made herself available so we could come pick them up (hadn't left Boston yet).  To summarize, this studio, hostess and neighborhood are GREAT! Highly recommend."
7281884,51535507,2015-10-21,42269400,Mareike,This Apartment is really great.
Everything was like in the description or even better. This apartment was so cozy,clean and inviting that we even stayed one night  in (and we were tourist) and just relaxed.,,,,
The communication with Tyree on everything was easy and so friendly,we felt almost at home. She even sent us something to our next stop at our Road Trip,because we forgot something.,,,
The neighborhood is the cutest Street you can imagine,we wished we could have been there for Halloween.,,,,
OK here is the Rundown:,,,,,

It doesn't matter if you are a Tourist from another Country or an American on a business Trip you should definitely stay at this Air bnb.,,,,,

7281884,51711236,2015-10-24,11137680,Tonya,"Tyree's apartment is located in a quiet, older neighborhood a short distance from Downtown Boston. ($10 Uber ride to anywhere downtown).   There isn't a lot of stores, restaurants, etc near the apartment, so you will need to drive to these locations.  If  you rent a car, Tyree will cone off a parking space for you in front of the house.  Parking is limited, so it's great that she will do this for you. If you plan to go outside of town (Plymouth, Salem, Cape Cod) you will need a car.  But, if you plan on staying in Boston the whole time, I would suggest that you use Uber and save money."
The house itself is 200 years old which is unique,but the studio apartment is very modern with hardwood floors,recent paint,kitchen sink,small fridge,cable TV and Wi-Fi.
Tyree and her husband were very welcoming.  They are very nice people and genuinely seemed concerned about making sure that we had everything we needed.  Tyree provided a cell phone for her and her husband,and told us that we could contact them anytime (they live downstairs on a separate floor).,,,,
The apartment has it's own entrance and is very nice.  The place was extremely clean and we had no issues whatsoever.  There is also a great view of the city!  However,I would warn the elderly about the stairs.  Since it's an old house,the stairs are narrow and steep and there is a lot of them! So,if you have knee problems or any issues with climbing stairs,this may be of concern to you.,
Overall,this was a great place to stay.  We have no doubt that if we ever return to Boston,we will stay in Tyree's apartment again!,,,
Thanks Tyree!,,,,,

7281884,52968216,2015-11-03,42862089,Leah,Thanks for a wonderful place to stay while we were in Boston! The apartment was perfect and we had a great time! Tyree was a kind and thoughtful host.
7281884,53183703,2015-11-06,20575338,Randy,Great accommodations and great host!  We hope to return again someday.
7281884,53273656,2015-11-07,15492450,Brent,Tree was great. She saved my parking life!
7281884,53760570,2015-11-12,4321823,Will,"We had an absolutely wonderful escape to Boston from our home in (URL HIDDEN) is hard to find a reasonably priced location near downtown Boston.  And now we have found it!  The quiet and secure neighborhood is historic and it is clear that all the owners have a sense of pride in their neighborhood.  It is an easy walk to the Orange Line and the bus lines.  The studio apartment was spacious, ultra-clean and well appointed.  The bed linens were very comfortable and the towels were soft and fresh.  Tyree's husband welcomed us warmly and generously to their home, even saving us a parking spot directly in front of the house.  Tyree was equally as welcome with complete information about access to the apartment and her welcome.  She was a wonderful communicator.  We recommend this charing urban studio to other airbnbers."
7281884,54765360,2015-11-23,7441000,Carrie,"Tyree accommodated our early arrival and  the apt itself was as expected. Public trans to Boston took longer than expected due to out of service line and a few inexperience mistakes, so I recommend taking an uber. We had trouble with the wifi and Tyree was very responsive to communicating a fix."
7281884,55130295,2015-11-28,42125940,Jay,"First of all, Boston is an amazing city. The freedom trail was my favorite part of the city."
Most importantly,I feel that the location of our lodging was very important. Tyree has an amazing studio apartment. The place was very spacious (my friend,my niece,and I had plenty of room). Its also very close to key parts of the city (10 mins away from Lowes Theatre and the Boston Common).,,
Tyree,was the best host. Any issue I had resulted in her immediate attention. I was amazed with how quickly her response and resolution was. I ended up leaving an item back upon my departure. Tyree was kind enough to let me know and to send it back via mail. I'm very impressed.,,,,
The home is located in a cul de sac and has a dedicated for a parking spot. It was my first time driving up to New England,and having a spot to park made it so much more enjoyable to explore the city at my leisure.,,,,
Thanks Tyree for the amazing place. This will be my first choice the next time I visit!,,,,,

7281884,55576228,2015-12-02,46716250,Meghan,Tyree was very accommodating! I arrived later than I had originally expected and she was very nice about it. I felt very welcome. The studio itself was as described and very cozy!
7281884,56791347,2015-12-18,2919692,Caitlin,"I had such a wonderful stay at this place! Tyree met me and showed me the space- the lights were on, soft music playing and it smelled clean. She saved me a parking space and even offered to help carry my luggage, which shows how thoughtful she is! There were some snacks available which were greatly appreciated, the room was spacious and comfortable, and the location was perfect. The cutest street I've ever seen. All in all, everything was wonderful and I'll certainly come back next time I'm in Boston!"
7281884,57049859,2015-12-21,1498963,Fari,Tyree was very hospitable. She met me in front of the place and took the time to walk me through the check-in process. She was available for things like providing extra towels and adjusting the thermostat. The place was very spacious and cute. I would definitely stay there again.
7281884,58544551,2016-01-03,47352462,Kaitlin,"Tyree's home was beautiful and clean. She was very accommodating and made us feel welcome. She explained all modes of transportation to us, but we opted for uber for convenence. Tyree was very nice, and made sure we knew she was available at all times. I would definitely recommend her and this home. A ten minute uber ride brought you right into downtown and her block was extremely quiet, which made for a good nights sleep!"
7281884,59295577,2016-01-09,25887857,Christophe,"Oui, l'hôte a été présente dès notre arrivée jusqu'à notre départ. Il nous a été fourni diverses informations concernant la ville. Le logement correspondait à l'annonce, et convenait tout à fait pour un couple! Une bonne expérience!"
7281884,60438616,2016-01-23,11183309,Joy,"Due to personal matters, my partner and I had to return home and never got to stay in Tyree's studio--however, she was VERY hospital, responsive, and friendly in all communications and I regret we weren't able to stay with her! She made sure every question I had was answered and was quick to direct us to the apartment at whatever time we got there."
7281884,61657588,2016-02-07,9811504,Lannee,"Tyree was very helpful through text message which is perfect because we don't like intrusive hosts. This was a studio part of a big house but there was a lot of privacy. The neighborhood was beautiful. Checking in and out was very easy! I LOVED the flexibility and really appreciated it since we were coming from across the country (California). We didn't feel rushed on getting kicked out and to carry our suitcases to get some food before our flight. Overall, was an easy going experience which was just what we needed on our quick business trip."
7281884,62885471,2016-02-18,6005874,Minerva,"Very clean. Wonderful space. Private neighborhood. The only thing is that it is so far from the T. Other than that, I had a lovely time and tyree was a kind, gracious, and welcoming host. I would gladly stay there again if I were welcomed."
7281884,65645092,2016-03-16,43975087,Sara,"I am so incredibly thankful that I was able to stay at Tyree's unit during my weekend in Boston. Located in Roxbury, the unit was quite close to downtown, but, because it was located on a dead end/roundabout, we felt like we were miles away from the craziness of Boston (which was welcome after a day of exploring and driving). Our flights were delayed and we had some issues with our rental car, so we were hours late to our meet up with Tyree. Even though she was out when we arrived, she sent us a number of texts explaining how to access the unit and how/where to park. When we gained access to to the unit, the lights were on and music was playing softly - how wonderful after a stressful day! My sister remarked a bit later that she felt really safe and comfortable there and I think we felt that way throughout the whole stay. We had everything we needed, the bed was comfortable, Tyree was only a call or text away (but we never had to reach out), and we always had a place to park. Highly, highly recommend. And, my next trip to Boston, I'm definitely checking if Tyree has availability before booking anywhere else!"
7281884,67939673,2016-04-01,48424115,Brittany,The house was very cute and she had all of the amenities we could want. Plus she had left water and snacks at check in and music playing to welcome us! It was a wonderful surprise. She answered all of our questions promptly and even offered up her husband if we needed assistance. It was a great experience and we absolutely loved Boston.
7281884,68242366,2016-04-03,9929606,Kim & Heather,"My son and I were in Boston shopping for colleges. Our stay at Tyrees was great.  Clean, well appointed, and she has that million dollar view of Boston downtown. She lives in a very historic and charming part of Boston. I loved their neighborhood"
7281884,68377416,2016-04-04,14968006,David,"The apartment was nice, and about 5km from downtown Boston (2 buses, or about 15mins by taxi)."

7281884,69713485,2016-04-12,45232017,Zuza,"All the below comments are 100% accurate. Tyree was a perfect host! Extremely tidy apartment with extra supplies delivered by Tyree, fresh towels, amazing view on the downtown. We received a detailed description on how to get into the studio and throughout the stay out host was making whether we are set or whether we need anything. Under 10 dollar ride to anywhere downtown with Fasten, beautiful historical neighborhood and a very competitive price!"
7281884,70201193,2016-04-16,45942555,Daniel,"This was my first Airbnb experience so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. While I never met Tyree, she was very easy to get ahold of and continually checked in with me during my stay to make sure it was going well and to see if I needed anything, which I appreciated. Her husband was the one who let me into the unit, and he was very friendly. He even helped carry my bags up the flight of stairs. The space was clean and cozy and for the most part quiet. The side entrance provided a lot of privacy. This was a business trip, so I wasn't able to explore the neighborhood, but the studio was perfect for relaxing in after a long day of work. Overall it was a great experience."
7281884,70599514,2016-04-18,26864359,Danni,There aren't enough words to describe how wonderful and beyond accommodating Tyree was. The  Studio was absolutely lovely and had everything that I needed during my brief stay.  It was clean and had plenty of natural light with nice and comfy decor.  I was genuinely taken aback. Everything was as described on the listing and I was very pleasantly surprised by the first aid kit and the feminine products in the bathroom. Tyree was THAT thoughtful.  I appreciated the signage on the walls (including wifi instructions and uplifting phrases). She made sure that everything was ok and continued to check up on me during the weekend and even dropped me back to the bus station for my return trip! I felt like i was at home away from home. I would definitely stay here again. No doubt about it.  I'd give more than 5 stars if i could.
7281884,70725767,2016-04-20,54481607,Sean,"Excellent host, great communication.  Made the stay perfect.  Very clean and exactly as described.  I am very picky and will stay here again"
7281884,71793334,2016-04-28,28017019,Kevin,"\"Tyree owns a wonderful apartment. While it's on the third story, getting your suitcase up there is the worst of your problems. The place is spacious, the bed more than comfortable, and there's access to just about every major appliance you need. There is a Walgreens open until midnight nearby for emergencies, and there is very easy access to public transportation or a 15 minute drive from South Station if you prefer taxi. And all and all, the place is just beautiful. The word \"\"charming\"\" fits the place perfectly.\""
7281884,73672813,2016-05-09,63936432,Kelly,"This apartment was very clean, spacious and modern. We felt very comfortable during our stay. Tyree was great to communicate with making herself available 24 hours a day and also making sure that we had everything we needed. The location is in a quiet street and was only a short trip from downtown Boston. We would definitely stay here again!"
7281884,74114771,2016-05-13,58110937,Taylor,Unfortunately we had to leave abruptly and wasn't able to stay in the home.  But Tyree was easy to get ahold of and had a beautiful studio to stay in.
7281884,74784811,2016-05-16,20322222,Karine,"We haven't met Tyree but she gave us clear explications to get the keys.  We loved her place, it's clean and cozy.  Friendly neighborhood.  Thanks a lot Tyree!"
7281884,75209034,2016-05-19,66389507,Jamie,"Our stay was great!  The place was clean, quiet  and exactly as described.  Loved having street parking included.  About a 15 minute uber ride to anywhere in Boston.  We even got two uber rides free by referring each other.  Although we never met Tyree, she was very informative on everything we needed for our stay and checked in often.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay a little outside of the hustle and bustle."
7281884,75558234,2016-05-22,23406141,Cameron,Great place and great host. A little out of city centre with not much around but it was easy enough to get into Boston where there was plenty to see and do.
"Tyree's apartment was clean and well equipped with everything we needed for a great stay. The bath/shower is a little worn but works well enough and the bed was comfortable (though it does have plastic backed sheets).\"",,,,,

7281884,76619764,2016-05-28,1197174,Bob & Myleen,"Tyree is a wonderful host, she is a very sweet person and has a lovely family.  We were able to meet her and her husband as well as their funny kids.  They day we were departing, she was having family over for a Memorial Day BBQ.  She very kindly invited us to join and partake in what I'm sure was a delicious meal.  We didn't take her up on her offer as we had plans for some last minute sight seeing before our flight.  The studio that we stayed in is in her beautiful renovated, 200 year old, 6000 square foot Victorian home.  It is amazing the beauty and craft work of these homes built so long ago.   The studio itself is clean, comfortable and spacious.  We selected Tyree's place because we were in town for Harvard Graduation and her location was in between Cambridge and Down Town Boston where we planned to sight see.  We we surprised at how easy it was to get to/from down town and how cheap it was to Uber everywhere we needed to go.    We had a rental car and though parking is on the street, Tyree had a parking space for us right in front of the house blocked off with cones.  That was a nice plus.  We would recommend staying with Tyree."
7281884,78485442,2016-06-07,67089494,David,It was awesome everything I could have expected. Place was awesome and clean and cozy.
7281884,79170716,2016-06-11,24702070,Sebastian,We had a wonderful stay at Tyree's apartment. Everything is exactly as described and in a good neighbourhood. But you have to go by bus or cab to get to the city center.
"We would definetly come back!\"",,,,,
7281884,80052866,2016-06-15,64168421,Suzanna,"My husband and I loved our stay here! Tyree had everything in her studio: comfortable bed, suitable restroom, sitting area, Kitchenette, TV. But all the extras really made our stay! We loved the small electric skillet under the sink that allowed us to cook ourselves breakfast. I am a tea drinker and she had several varieties available! Just the little things like that made for a wonderful stay!"
The studio was very private,"with it's own entrance which we appreciated. I would definitely recommend Tyree's studio to others! \"",,,,
7281884,80745400,2016-06-19,9949755,Kenneth,"The Place was great. Perfect location, perfect price. I especially loved the house that Tyree and her husband are renovating. I'd love to go back soon to see the whole thing once it's finished. The parking was a little different than I'm used to, but not that unusual for the Northeast. I walked away loving Boston and looking forward to returning for a longer stay Next time... I just can't get enough of that rich History."
7281884,84137067,2016-07-05,8663726,Christopher,Really love studio on a lovely street close to downtown Boston.  Tyree made getting in hassle free and provided a great place to stay.  Had a wonderful time and would definitely stay there again.
7281884,84967220,2016-07-09,33014435,Clare,"We really enjoyed our stay in this lovely studio. It's a quiet street with beautiful character houses. Arriving, we loved how the air con was on, music and lots of great touches like fresh bread, milk, tea and coffee. We even had a wonderful neighbour look out for us. We drove and it's less than 10 mins from down town and only a bit further to the airport. And great to have a decent Tv with lots of channels! Everything was great, would definitely stay again!"
7281884,86100425,2016-07-14,19070694,Dimitrios,"I drove to Boston for a conference and had a great and convenient stay at this studio. The description is accurate and the amenities are well described in the other recent reviews. It was very easy to get to the convention center with Uber, just 10-15 min."

11343048,85968128,2016-07-14,68861572,Lyndsey,"Melba was exactly the type of host that we needed. While she wasn't present to meet or talk with us, we liked it that way. Her hands-off approach made us feel as though we were living in the city rather than imposing on someone's space. She was always very communicative and willing to help us be as comfortable as possible. The listing was extremely accurate in person, with amenities that made it feel homey."

This place has got a fair amount of space and is extremely convenient with close access to the T and Boston. There's a supermarket and lots of solid dining options a short walk away. Its got lots of beds. Melba is a good host, is communicative and checking in/out was very easy. It's in a college student centric neighborhood and the place feels a bit like a college dorm room. It wasn't loud or anything like that, but it's an older style building."
11343048,89055798,2016-07-26,47688525,Corinne,"We had a wonderful stay in Boston, despite the terrible heat. Melbas Apartment was clean, very  spacy and well equipped. I love her way to mix different styles. There is a little balcony, we loved to sit there in the evening. The two AC did their work very well. We reached the Green-line to the Central Places within 5 min, unfortunately this line is very slow. We would stay again in Melbas Apartment."
11343048,90085730,2016-07-31,58531169,Kelly,Nothing fancy here-but lots of space. Good for students visiting the area. Melba was responsive when needed.

11343048,92664522,2016-08-09,958602,Leigh,"The apartment was spacious, clean and bright. The location was close to BU, once you get a feel for the neighborhood. Melba was great about communicating, and made this an easy stay."
11343048,96634869,2016-08-23,29115877,David,Melba was nice to communicate with but the listing was not what we expected. It said there was a double bed in the bedroom but it was actually two twins. My biggest problem was an odor that was persistent throughout our five night stay. Melba immediately sent someone over to take care of it but the smell did not go away.
"Other than that the place doesn't have many usable outlets or great lighting in the living room. \"",,,,,
11343048,97666622,2016-08-28,66559084,Adrienne,"Melba was a great host, really friendly and answered all our queries as soon as possible. We loved the flat, it was comfortable and the bathroom was really nice. Great location in Allston near a starmart and down the road from BU and a goodwill store. Wifi worked well. Would definitely recommend staying in the flat. Also it had a lovely balcony you could sit out on which gets the sun in the daytime. The only problem was the AC in the living room which leaked water if left on for a few hours, which meant we were really really hot during the day and evening."

The localisation of the appartement is perfect : close to the touristic area, without being right in the middle of Boston. Metro station is at walking distance.

Max and Monica were perfect hosts: picked us up from the airport,extremely friendly,gave us maps and tour books,very clean room and bathroom,fresh towels,asked us for our grocery list for breakfast
Their home is right next to the historical Bunker Hill. It is around 1 mile away from Boston. A minutes walk to the nearest train.,,,,,

We did not meet Max because he was away (but he communicated well before the visit), but found Monica to be a really fantastic host. She went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and at home. The flat itself is really lovely and was spotlessly clean. The room is large and the bed was really comfortable. Monica had lots of information there for us when we arrived and even gave us a lift to the museum so we could get there when it was free admission! She also provided a delicious breakfast and went and especially bought some pumpkin ice cream for us to try! We would not hesitate recommending Max and Monica’s as a place to stay."

182613,593425,2011-10-03,1139692,Patricia,"We enjoyed very much our stay in this cosy little place in Charlestown close to downtown Boston. Max and Monica, our hosts, were welcoming and they gave us good tips on what to do or where to go. We enjoyed meeting them and spending some time with them. The place was very clean and well organized.  We felt like at home."
182613,651834,2011-10-22,1031393,Inga Maria,"First of all, this was our first Airbnb experience and we were a little bit unsure about how that would be staying at flats of  people we don´t know. Our first stay could possibly not have been with anyone better than Max& Monica. They were both really helpful and friendly. We had some very good chats in the evening and enjoyed that very much, thanx Monica :-)"
Additionally,the flat was really nice,not far from downtown,bus stop right in front of the house,all very clean and breakfast was very good. The bed was comfortable ...what else can I say,everything was just perfect. We wish you both all the best for the future
182613,12758224,2014-05-10,11852425,Robyn,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we picked the right hosts to start with. The apartment was perfect!! Very conveniently located, able to walk downtown, run along the Harbor and less than a mile to the Museum of Science, shopping and my husbands office."
"Max and Monica were amazing. Monica was gracious enough to meet us at the apartment at 1am (!!) and showed us around. They checked in to see if we needed anything and were available for assistance when needed. We will definitely stay here again!!\"",,,,,
182613,15320973,2014-07-07,6207729,Mary,"Max was very good at keeping in touch.  The apartment was clean, quiet and comfortable.  We were visiting relatives in Charlestown and we could walk everywhere. This apartment is convenient to Bunker Hill Monument and Navy Yard."

182613,16402590,2014-07-27,15602386,Valerie,"Max and his sister-in-law Niki were very welcoming. Niki gave a lot of restaurant recommendations, all of which we tried and enjoyed. If we had any questions during our stay Max got back to us very quickly via text."
The condo/apartment was exactly what we expected. It was very cute,clean,comfortable and well stocked. We had a concern that the wall ACs would not be sufficient,but they worked perfectly,even on days when the outside temps were 90°.,
The location is great! The 93 bus runs just outside the door and takes you into the heart of the city and to the subway lines. Also,there is a whole Foods Market just a short walk away and a few restaurants that are equally as close. Make sure you bring comfortable walking shoes as Boston is best seen/traveled on foot. We stayed for seven days,without renting a car.,,,
"If I have friends or family that plan on visiting the Boston area I will highly recommend this venue. Hopefully one day my family and I will be able to return.\"",,,,,

182613,21100321,2014-10-11,8862095,Alex,"Max flat is really good and functional. The neighborhood is one of the best of Boston. It might look like a bit far from the town center but the subway is close enough to walk there and the bus 93, just downstairs,  is really of help if it is rainy. Max also gave us access to his private parking lot. Really convenient."
MAx is really a nice lad. He helped out with any request we had and was really there if needed.,,,,,

Max answered all our questions fast,and gave us good recommendations (Figs restaurant is great and Bunker Hill monument and historic Liberty,,,,
Trail beautiful ).,,,,,
We had a problem with the oven and they resolved it in a few hours.,,,,,
The kitchen is very nice and clean with new dishes and a dishwasher.,,,,,
We stayed with them for 7 nights and it was great! The area is also fantastic.,,,,,
Was our first time using Airbnb and was very surprising to find everything as it was advertised on the site.,,,,,

Everything was clean and inviting and ready for my family and I to begin enjoying our Boston stay.

Max is so kind and helpful. We had a problem with the TV cable & wifi service on check in, and he didn't leave us until it was solved. The furniture is comfortable, utensils & accessories of the kitchen and bathroom more than enough. We only had some hassle with parking the car but it was manageable."
If I return back to Boston,"I'll ask to stay at the same apartment.\"",,,,

We can only hope that when we are back in Boston this beautiful place will be available!   We could not have asked for more!!!  Well pleased!!!  Thank you Max!
182613,33572150,2015-05-30,5631294,Michele&Craig,"Max's apartment was great. It was clean,  spacious and well equipped. Max left us a bottle of wine, tea and coffee and some snacks which was really appreciated. Both bedrooms are a good size with one of them having 2 double beds. The washer and drier in the basement was very useful. Max met us on arrival, even though it was late, and gave us some useful information. The apartment was fairly handy for downtown using the Community College T stop (orange line) or the bus. We needed to be in Harvard square which was a fairly inexpensive taxi ride away. I would recommend Max's apartment."
182613,34314245,2015-06-07,32386239,Boris,Fantastic experience.   Bus transporation right outside the door of the condo and 10-12 min walk to the Orange Line - Community College T stop.

Will plan to return to this apartment next time we are in Boston.

182613,36767531,2015-07-01,29708854,Peter,"Neat, clean place at the corner of Bunker Hill Street and Green Street, an address that made it very easy for a newcomer to find the way either to the Community College subway stop, or the North End and its history and restaurant scene, or Charlestown and its monument and Navy Yard area itself.  Good location for someone willing to walk a pleasant ten minutes, while looking at a gentrifying neighborhood."
Two bedrooms,one bath,and a kitchen/living room area.   It is not overstuffed with soft,fragile things,"so I felt comfortable that I was not going to break or soil things (which is to say that it is lightly furnished with big empty closets and shelves and open areas) which suited me just perfectly.

It was a little bit crowded,of course,but  perfect for our needs. Everything was clean and comfortable and all of us really enjoyed our stay there.,,,

I loved the location. This was a very satisfying experience."

The condo was as described and was VERY clean! Our family appreciated the extra space that the 2 bedrooms, living/dining and kitchen provided. We felt safe in the neighborhood (we weren't out very late) and it was overall a quiet spot. The listing accurately described the transportation options and we used them all. Bunker Hill was between the place and the T stop so we had to walk up and down the hill a quite a few times. We stayed during a heat wave so the walk got tiring a few days but it helped us burn all the calories from Boston's great food! We stopped at the Whole Foods by the T stop most days and it was nice to have a full service grocery near us."

Matthew was very fastidious about every detail--he had toiletries there just in case, provided lovely folded clean towels, the whole apartment was immaculate, and he even gave us treats for our two dogs just as a nice gesture. He allowed us to use his laundry detergent to do a load of laundry while we stayed, and he made us feel very welcome in his home. We highly recommend both the host and the digs!"

It was only a five minute walk to the Park St stn, which served to be a central transferring area that connected most of the basic transit & touring routes. It was also a two minute walk to Charles stn, which served a touring route to Harvard and MIT for tourists. It was a five minute walk to everything, hospital, 24hr convenience store, metro stations, eateries, coin laundromat, and more. Andres was very responsive to my questions and needs. The residence itself was very clean, cozy, and stacked with everything that one needs for travel. FOR WORKOUT JUNKIES, there is a 24/7 gym called planet fitness. which is located ten min away from Andres'. Signing up fee was only $5 dollars, with a one month fee for $10, beating a regular one time gym use fee of any other gyms.

8170181,74250262,2016-05-14,1683323,William,Flat was a cosy flat right in Beacon Hill which is such an amazing location. Andres had kindly left some snacks and toiletries for me. Communication was very quick and easy each time.
8170181,75198766,2016-05-19,63336440,Kamala,"The advantage of this property is its location.  It's as central as central can be!  Boston common, Freedom trail and all the tourist attractions.  One can walk to Harvard and MIT and those who don't want to, metro station is very close."
The apartment is safe,very nice though not a large one.  Sufficient for a family of 3 or 4.  Kitchen is really small but everything is available in the apartment.  Andres has left a lot of towels in the apartment and supply of toilet roll and toiletries were there too. Host was responsive to all my messages.,,,,

8170181,80182903,2016-06-16,16403543,Stefano,Our accomodation in Andre's apartment was fantastic: it's very cozy and tidy.
All the pictures show how the apartment is in reality: there's a bedroom with a double bed,a Living room with a sofa which can be opened and become an additional double bed,a little working kitchen and a little bathroom.,,,
The house is also provided of TV,wi-fi,air conditioner.,,,
A plus is the location of the apartment: Beacon Hill is very nice place,elegant and quiet...5min by walk from Boston midtown,but at the same time very relaxing !!,,,
We didn't meet Andrea...but all his  instructions were clear and sufficient to find home and manage different things about it (door keys,trash and recycling waste,etc..),,,
I suggest all kind of people to try Andres apartment with no doubts.,,,,,

8170181,93157796,2016-08-11,68059586,Mary,"Beacon Hill is a great location to stay in. It is very walkable to many major sights and the T is close by. The apartment was smaller than we thought, but I think that is normal for an apartment in the heart of Boston. No major problems and if anything was wrong it was fixed within one day. There is only one AC window unit and that did make it a little hard for my boyfriend to sleep during the hot summer nights, but I was OK. Overall, it was a great place."
8170181,94099918,2016-08-14,4082820,Prue,"We did not meet the host and, in fact, the host was different to the one we originally booked through.  Mark did give us clear instructions on how to enter the property, which was accurate, and we let ourselves in.  We did not hear from Mark (or Ashley) during our time at the apartment though I am sure they would have been easily contactable should we have needed their help.   The apartment was a lot smaller than we expected and I do think it would have been hard to cook a meal in the kitchen, even though there was a full size oven and stove top.  The kitchen area was very small.  The best part of the apartment was its location to pretty much the centre of Boston.  Beacon Hill is a lovely area and there were many different amenities available nearby.  For a short stay, this place is ideal as there are plenty of eateries within walking distance."
8170181,96388326,2016-08-22,1322346,Guy,"Mark and Ashley's cosy place was perfect for this first stay in Boston!!

At first sight the area does not look inviting, but I experienced no problems. The appartment is located in the basement of the building and was very clean. There are no personal belongings of the owner, and this gave the appartment a \"\"sterile\"\" feel. It was very quite.\""

Lots of restaurants in the area. The apt itself was a bit bland, but had everything you need. Seems to be one of several units in the bldg. Shared kitchenette.

The air conditioners kept the humidity out of the apartment. Some water bottles and assorted beers were provided in the kitchen area, which was great!"
One thing to note - if you're going to the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center,the T is more of a hassle than it's worth as you have to switch lines a few times. I either walked or took an $8 Uber instead.,,,,

Although I didn't meet my hosts, check-in was very easy using the simple instructions they provided.  And compared to some of the very high-priced Boston listings in airbnb, their place was relatively affordable and below the maximum that my company allows us to spend.  The apartment is in the heart of Chinatown, and I enjoyed delicious meals at a Chinese dumpling place and a Korean restaurant nearby.  A 15-minute walk to our Boston office, this will be a go-to place to stay for me in the future."

The bed is new and mattress is memory foam (I think.) Very comfortable after a long travel. The shower is very hot and the water pressure is superb. She has two wifi networks available and both worked quickly,no problem.,,,,
You use electronic number codes to access the building and the apartment,but she also has regular keys for backup,in case a problem arises. In my case,there was a problem with the front door,but she came to my rescue and worked with me to figure everything out. She was very gracious the entire stay and made sure that I encountered no further problems. I would stay in this location again in a heartbeat.,

This is an old row house that has been converted to small apartments. Inside the locked apartment door are a bathroom,a bedroom and a bit of a living room.,,,,
Outside the locked apartment door is a tiny kitchen area with a microwave.,,,,,
It has been recently renovated,and is spotlessly clean.,,,,
The tile floors are a bit cold underfoot,but basically it's a clean,quiet place.,,,
As far as the neighborhood,it's at the junction of Tufts University,Chinatown,and skyscraper downtown.,,
Chinatown's crowded and a bit dilapidated but in a completely charming way. It's a level,pleasant and safe,,,,
20-30 minute walk along busy city streets to the convention center. There are many,many restaurants within a few minutes walk,and quite a few you can reach in less than a minute if you walk fast. There are multiple Chinese bakeries a few blocks away. There is a Whole Foods a few blocks south.,,,

-Put the wifi password somewhere for people to find,,,,,
-Get another electrical outlet put in so people don't have to do power cord gymnastics to have the A/C and TV plugged in.,,,,,
-The Roku box is cool but useless since it just drops in the middle of every program (you probably want a wired connection instead).,,,,,

You need not walk far to enjoy some of the best that Boston has to offer, including the very convenient T, which will take you to farther reaches. My sons and I stayed for a couple of nights, and we couldn’t have asked for a better home base for our visit. The studio has nice decor and was just as portrayed in the pictures and description. And while it was no issue for us at all, we would add one note for anyone with impaired mobility: To reach the studio, which is on the basement level, you need to descend just a few external stairs. The additional information upon booking was clear and complete, so we exchanged only minimal email communication with Christopher. On arrival, we found the housekeeping service had not set out the air mattress, but it was quickly and easily resolved in a brief phone call, which Christopher answered immediately. We appreciated the newly renovated bathroom—two shower heads, what a luxury!—the modern and well-equipped kitchen, and the high quality linens. We were very grateful for the air conditioning on the hot July days and nights we were there. Plus it was nice to unwind while watching movies on Netflix. Thank you very much, Christopher, for a comfortable, memorable trip to Boston!"

It was a pleasure to stay there,with the exception of some communication problems with the host.,,,,
Christopher wasn't very responsive to emails and messages. I didn't get any response on my emails I've sent on Air BNB since the reservation was accepted. And when you are travelling,calling using international roaming can be very pricey.,,,,
Also,TV at the apartment didn't work. And when I messaged Christopher about it on the day of our arrival,he didn't get back to me until lunch time next day,saying that he will see what he can do. I haven't heard from him since,and TV problem wasn't fixed.,

The bed wasn't a real bed--rather a bed that folded out from the wall (it's the white cupboard in the main picture), and was not particularly comfortable. There was only a partial roll of toilet paper left in the bathroom, and only one towel, despite the fact that I had written in my request that two people would be staying there. When we looked in the closet for another towel, it was filled with dirty linens and clothes. The netflix also didn't work. The rest of the amenities were fine, but it definitely wasn't worth more than $200."

Some things to note for future travelers:,,,,,
- it's located at the basement,,,,,
- there're a few steep steps to walk down before entering the apartment,,,,,
Some improvements:,,,,,
1) toilet roll,tissue paper extra supplies should be made known on where they're kept or at least fully stocked. We got an empty tissue box and an almost empty roll of toilet paper roll; had to hunt around the house,,,,
2) no kettle to boil water.,,,,,
3) suggest to pull some curtains over the door window for some privacy,,,,,
4) roku box isn't working,,,,,
5) air-conditioner seems to be non existent. Thankfully there was a fan,,,,,

The apartment is well maintained and although I did not use the kitchen it had every utensil you could possibly need should you require.  The bathroom was compact,but clean and modern.,,,,

3302294,22645625,2014-11-11,20441450,Benny,"Christopher's apartment is very comfortable and well situated in the city of Boston. Maybe the appartment is bit dark, since it is in a basement. But if you are out in the city during the day, the appartment is perfect for ending the day with a movie and a warm shower..."
Except one time,"Christopher was always very responsive to e-mails and made us feel very welcome in his place. \"",,,,

"Would definitely book again!\"",,,,,
3302294,25663453,2015-01-22,25586189,Julia,It was a great experience in Boston. Chris is a great host by providing clear instructions. The place is in a very good locations. All the shops and stores are just 3 mins walk away. It was a lovely stay.
But the floor could be cleaner and the shower room as well. The kitchen is clean.,,,,,
"Overall it was good. \"",,,,,
3302294,25755880,2015-01-25,22951394,Aubrey,Such a great location from which to explore Boston. The space was clean and as described. The key pad entry was very convenient. Great little place to stay.
3302294,26266890,2015-02-08,26038979,Gang,"This is my first time Airbnb experience. Now I must say it was a venture for me. I booked 3 days but after first night, I decidely moved out. And now workng with Airbnb solution team for the rest 2-days fare refund, as Christopher has no response at all. Flowing are reasons why I moved out."
1. All pictures in your introduction are same as room,however,you never mention it is a basement. If I knew this fact,I may considered this seriously and may not book you room.,,
2. Poor readiness to stay. I informed you about two days before we chaecked in about our exact arrival time and we have 3 person. However,when we enter the room,we found aircinditioner was off. The 2nd bed is not ready yet. We filled air for mattress,finding blanket and quilt by ourselves.,,
3. Coldness. even 4 hrs after we turned on airconditioner,it's still cold,forced us sleep with sweater on for whole night. By the way,"cold window can come into room from the gaps of front door of basement. 4. Most unaceptable reason is that the noise in basement(might be the airconditioner of this room or whole apartments) is great and we can not sleep at all.\"",,
3302294,27161623,2015-02-27,7341630,Chanda,"This was the first time I've left a rental midway through a trip. I left and paid MORE to stay in a hotel. I wish I would have seen the most recent review at the time I booked this place (the review posted very recently and I book a couple months ago), because I never would have booked the stay."
Everything in the previous review by Gang is 100 percent accurate. Bare in mind this language barrier,he's speaking to the sounds the heater made rather than the AC. The heater made incredibly loud and awful sounds all night long. While I'm grateful it was turned on,I couldn't sleep at all because of the rattling and shrieking coming from the baseboard unit right next to the bed and in the nearby kitchen.,,,
Also,the lighting is completely off in the photos provided. The space is very dark. Additionally,there was salt from the recent snow tracked through the entire place and a bag of dirty laundry by the door. I was very uncomfortable with the idea that someone/a company was coming by to pick up this dirty laundry while I was there. I ended up carrying all of my luggage with me to a conference because I had no idea who had the keypad code to this place.,,,
The bed is terribly uncomfortable and,for the current temperatures of 10 degrees at night,"there is insufficient bedding available. You're told specifically in the host instructions not to take any additionally bedding from the closet... despite the THIN \"\"comforter\"\" provided. The bed is no better than a pull-out couch with a metal bar in your back.",,,
I was so uncomfortable and unhappy with this listing,"I stayed one night and left the next day for a hotel. I paid TWICE because I didn't want to stay there.\"",,,,
3302294,27410029,2015-03-03,27951355,Isabella,Great location! Hoped for bigger apartment but was perfectly clean and very pretty. Great host!
3302294,27878319,2015-03-14,3782234,Gloria Elena,Unfortunately our experience in this apartment wasn't the best.
The neigborhood is very beautiful quiet and well located. (Walking distance to Public Gardens,Boston Common,Public Library,Copley Station,Newbury Street,Charles River
The apartment is as shown in the pictures.,,,,,
The apartment was very dirty,to the point that we didn't use the kitchen to cook,the sheets were dirty also and the closet was useless because of the desorder.,,,
As the apartment is in the basement,you can hear the building's machines during the nights.,,,,
One day,someone got into the apartment to leave something while we were outside and nobody noticed us.,,,,
We would'nt stay in this apartment the next time.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3302294,27942458,2015-03-15,24700231,Lindsey,"The location of the apt just off of Newbury St in the Back Bay is absolutely perfect. I never actually interacted with Christopher. I checked into the apartment electronically, and checked out the same way. The apartment is small, clean, and tidy. The bed is very comfortable. The apartment does transmit some of the noise from the street and surrounding apartments, but with such a great location you will be out enjoying the city too much to notice. The apartment is below-street-level, so it's a little dark, but Christopher provides plenty of lights to keep the apartment well lit."
In summary,a small apartment option,"in the best neighborhood you could ask for in Boston.\"",,,
3302294,28719984,2015-03-29,24379263,Niki,Had a wonderful time at Christopher's place!! The perfect location ! my boyfriend and I were able to walk or take the T to every place we wanted to go. This apartment is exactly how the pictures showcase and was very clean! I would definitely stay here again it was a great location for those looking to explore Boston!

3302294,30010418,2015-04-15,20548678,Justin,The place is wonderful. I'm looking forward to staying there again.
3302294,30178191,2015-04-18,14061383,Roberta,Was noisy and not the cleanest. But the location is good and so was the price.

Convenient and user-friendly entry lock system. Free on street parking 8pm to 8am two streets over on Newbury.  Would definitely stay here again."
3302294,32046327,2015-05-13,21754250,Andrew,"Location was great, handy to shops, parks and places to eat. The street was great, lined with trees and surrounded by nice houses. The room was as described but the floor could have done with a clean/vaccum. From the afternoon  we arrived, as soon as we took off our shoes our feet were constantly dirty.  Other than that,  the place was good and communication was prompt and helpful."

I visited this Airbnb with my husband and parents for graduation and it was clean and as described in the listing. It is definitely a small space,but we were all quite comfortable on the bed and air mattress provided. We easily found street parking to unload the car and there are a number of parking lots available nearby.,,,,
All in all,"it was a great stay in a prime location. \"",,,,

The mattress was hard and frame slanted (Murphy bed). I can tell this is purely a rental property. Overall, a good stay, but I wish I had slept better."

3302294,35798844,2015-06-22,30809766,Amanda,"Just spent 3 nights at Christopher's place and it was everything I needed! The apartment looks exactly like it does in the pictures and is perfect for 1-2 people. It was clean, quaint, comfortable, and in an EXTREMELY accessible location. I had no problems travelling around the city and the area was nice. The bathroom came stocked with enough linens, which is very important for me since I don't like to travel with towels! The wifi was fast and the Netflix was nice to have."
"Christopher provided me with everything I needed to know before arriving and was quick to answer my questions. Loved every minute of my stay. This spot will be my first choice the next time I visit Boston!\"",,,,,
3302294,36039423,2015-06-24,21930021,Christopher,"To start off, this was my very first Air BnB experience. I was excited to join this community of people as I travel quite a bit and am constantly looking for new places to explore. So ill start with the good..."
Arrived at this quaint apartment in Bostons Back Bay and was delighted to realize how close it was to all the things my girlfriend and I were going to explore. Walking distance to shops,restaurants,Copley Plaza,Public Gardens etc..,,
The apartment itself has had a very recent update including rain shower,granite counters,stainless appliances and more. We loved it. Private entrance leading right out to the street which made things very easy when checking in and getting around. Thats the good. Next,the bad :/,,
When we arrived there was a bag of linens sitting outside the door. We thought maybe the cleaners were running late and we were about 15 mins early for check-in so we waited to see if they might show up. It was hot so after a few mins,we entered the apartment to find the bed not made,dirty sheets from the previous visitor. Towels left on the floor outside the bathroom. Trash in all receptacles. More towels inside the bathroom. Dishes in the sink. Gross.,,,
We ended up changing the bed ourselves,restocking the bathroom. Should I continue? Murphy bed with the worlds worst mattress,bouncy,uneven. We slept horribly. I would not stay again. In fact,"Im wording if ill use Air BnB again either. Very disappointed \"",
3302294,36371853,2015-06-28,24039232,Emily,"Christopher was very responsive during booking and throughout our stay.  He also let us drop our bags off at 11am when checkin wasn't until 3pm, which was super accommodating.  This is located in a great neighborhood that is close to everything (Newbury St, Boston Common, Fenway Park, etc).  We walked the entire time...even to Cambridge, South Boston, Charlestown, etc."
A few turnoffs:,,,,,
- We ran out of toilet paper (there was only one roll in the whole house) and Christopher was not very helpful,so we ended up just getting our own.  This was a little frustrating since we expected better hospitality.,,,,
- This place is very small,but you can tell that from the pictures and that is to be expected in Boston.,,,,
- Bugs - we did encounter quite a few bugs inside the apartment.  Maybe because it is a garden apartment and it was very hot while we were there?,,,,,
"- Bed/Sitting - bed was a spring mattress on a murphy bed and there was also only one arm chair in the living room area so it made sleeping/watching TV a little uncomfortable\"",,,,,
3302294,36751627,2015-06-30,36987202,Lindsay,"Christopher was a very accommodating host and the apartment was so lovely and cozy. Beautiful light, very neat and simplistically decorated. Staying here was effortless and comfortable, and I would definitely do so again!"
3302294,37375348,2015-07-06,35899284,Helvia,"El apartamento esta en una situación ideal, una zona tranquila y cerca del centro. Muy limpio. La cocina tiene de todo, excepto tostadora. El baño un poco pequeño. La cama es muy cómoda. TV grande con Netflix. Wifi gratis funciona fenomenal. Recomendable como alojamiento, no para pasar largos ratos dentro porque es pequeño."
3302294,38814366,2015-07-19,3131074,Mark,"Christopher was an excellent host, and answering when you need him for anything.  The place is a great area, and easy to get anywhere in Boston"

Christopher was courteous and very responsive to all of my questions before, and during, our stay. In fact, he coordinated a drop-off of an iron we needed badly right when we asked for it. Thank you, Ryan! The apartment is located in an exquisitely beautiful area with excellent access to everything one might be seeking. We were there for a conference at the Hynes Conv Center and we walked there and around the city every day. The apartment itself is small and would really be best for a max of two people. But we made it work despite the tight quarters. The kitchen and bathroom are great - top notch renovations. There is a large TV, a Murphy bed, an inflatable queen-sized mattress, a nightstand, a coffee table, two bar stools and another small table available for use. The entrance is very private and the key pad used to lock the door is a genius idea. It made the check-in/check-out process a breeze and not having to worry about keys was great. We were very happy with our experience and I would recommend this apartment to travelers looking to stay in a gorgeous area of Boston (which is pretty gorgeous everywhere, but still :)). Thank you, Christopher!"

3302294,43737531,2015-08-21,37705844,Erin,"Nice apartment in the Back Bay area! Apartment is very small, as many of the apartments are in this area, but for the price you cannot beat it! I would only recommend a maximum of 2 people staying here because of the size, but for a couple who is looking to get out of town and stay in back bay, this is a great choice! Walking distance to bars, restaurants, prudential center, shopping and the green line. Christopher was a good host and responded very quickly to my booking request and the apartment was very clean! Would stay here again!"
3302294,44993612,2015-08-30,40804515,Caroline,"He was super accommodating, helpful and easy to contact. We loved the location, beautiful tree lined cobble stoned street in a nice district easy to see most places of interest. There was a slight shortage of fresh towels so maybe bring some yourself - and the bed is a temp one so not the most comfortable. The lack of natural light in this basement apartment wasn't perfect but we spent a lot of time out and about. Super clean."
3302294,45452788,2015-09-02,42986166,Jonathan,"Christopher's apartment was a perfect location for our overnight in Boston.  The space was clean and set up well for its size.  The Murphy bed was comfortable, a great shower, and while we did not use the kitchen, it appeared to have everything you would need.  The apartment is in a beautiful neighborhood and was a 15 minute walk from Fenway Park.  Walking back late at night felt safe and coffee shops were close by in the morning.  Signs in the neighborhood say that parking is for Back Bay resident only and our out of state plates made us alittle concerned, as ticketing seemed to be aggressive, but we did not have any trouble in the end.  I would definitely stay again if I am back in Boston.  Thanks Christopher!"
3302294,45936342,2015-09-07,35029305,Melissa,Description was accurate. Very cute and charming neighborhood. Great location!
3302294,46480645,2015-09-11,12146702,Priya,"The apartment is in an excellent location - central to Back Bay shopping and dining.  Unfortunately, not sure worth the money charged.  The AC unit did nothing to cool the apt, and it was very hot.  Front door was swarming with flies and mosquitoes (I think there's a drain right there), and there were mosquitoes in the apartment.  Cleaning people also came early and had clearly been in the space when I expected to have total privacy.  All in all, great location, but not the best Air BnB experience I've had."
3302294,46741219,2015-09-13,6669933,Pat & Zena,Christopher was very responsive and helpful. The apartment itself was perfect for us and in a great location! I would definitely stay there again!
3302294,46960892,2015-09-14,2535411,Abi,"The apartment is in an excellent location, very central, and within walking distance to the centre of Boston. It is small, and is pleasantly and simply decorated. It is sparsely furnished, and although intended for 2 people, it has only one easy chair - so when we arrived after a long and tiring day, one person got to sit and relax in the comfortable chair, the other had to sit on one of the two (less than comfortable) high bar stools."
The mattress is not particularly comfortable; you can feel the outline of the springs when you just run your hand over the top,and even more so when lying on it - a mattress topper would be a good idea and make it more comfortable!,,,,
It's ironic that there was a very clear request that everything be washed up and left as found,"and yet there was no tea towel provided in order to dry things prior to putting them away. \"",,,,
3302294,47203613,2015-09-16,41373658,Carolyn,"Such an easy experience all round.  The apartment was exactly as described, great location, would recommend it to others for sure.  Thank-you!"

Location was easy walking distance to the subway system and the main streets. Felt very safe walking to bnb when it was dark at night. I would stay here again."
3302294,49246961,2015-10-02,24590040,Liz,"A very affordable, nice place in the best neighborhood in Boston where hotel rooms are sky high.  The Murphy bed is a little awkward for two people (or for the person who gets the wall side). The bathroom is small but very functional with beautiful fixtures.  We didn't really need the kitchen but it too was well appointed. The stairs down to the apartment might be tricky for those with mobility issues.  Our only issue was that it got quite warm one evening.  We called and he sent someone over very quickly to put in a window unit which cooled the apartment comfortably."
3302294,49781856,2015-10-06,17979757,Katie,"Summary: Unwelcoming and rude host, small, dirty apartment."
From the second we arrived at the apartment we felt extremely unwelcome. Christopher did not pick us up or meet us at the apartment,which is not a requirement,but he could have left a welcome pack or at least a list of where things were/how they worked.,,,
The actual apartment was filthy. The cleaner had done the best he could,but the filth was more severe than that. Little holes in the wall,damp on the ceiling,build up of dust on all ledges and a constant smell of mould.,,
It is a tiny apartment and the photos are very deceiving. What we thought was a wardrobe in the photos,was in fact the pull out bed folded up. Our friends were going to join us but luckily they could not as the apartment cannot fit 4 people,as Christopher has advertised.,,,
We were left with one roll of toilet paper,a speck of washing up liquid and nothing else. Again not a requirement,but something we have not experienced at other airbnbs.,,,
When we contacted Christopher throughout our stay he was unresponsive and unhelpful. When it came to checkout we needed somewhere to store our bags. Understandably someone else was booked in that day so we could not leave our bags,but Christopher was impolite and failed to even try and find a solution. He acted like it wasn't his problem.,,,,
Before this trip we have had such a positive experience from airbnb,but this stay hasn't come close. The location is good,but so is the location of hundreds of other apartments listed on airbnb in Boston - stay at one of those,"not here. \"",,
3302294,49978954,2015-10-08,26657124,Carolyn,"The bedsit is as described, clean and fresh with crisp linen and fluffy towels. Back Bay is a beautiful suburb close to Boston Common, the freedom trail and Fenway Park. Christopher provided easy access information and was quick to respond to any questions. Would recommend his apartment."

It's a garden apartment with a few windows, so during the day it is a little darker, but I loved it at night - we had been staying in places with a lot of natural light and found it difficult to sleep. The location in Back Bay is super convenient and in a fun, safe neighborhood. Christopher was very helpful and sent information along on getting into the apartment when we misplaced the original email. All-in-all a great experience!"
3302294,51479915,2015-10-20,45476791,Chelsea,"The apartment was in the best location! The street was out of a movie scene! The apartment was clean, well decorated, and there were travel brochures left out for us. The check in/out process was so easy. I definitely recommend!"

Beautiful surroundings; very close to restaurants and stores; just 20 - 30 min walking to downtown and 5 min walk to T station. Christopher answered all our questions promptly and was very accommodating with our requests."
3302294,54404374,2015-11-19,27551240,Jessica,Friend was visiting the city for the evening. We wanted a central location walking distance to the T and the city. It was beautiful and accessible to what we were looking for
3302294,54613040,2015-11-22,46072650,Katie,"This was a perfect spot for my first trip to Boston... it is located right in the heart of everything, and we were able to walk just about everywhere we wanted to go.  The apartment was clean and very well maintained, and Christopher was very quick to respond to every question we posed to him (including how to get the heat to turn off!). Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place in the heart of Boston."
3302294,54948115,2015-11-25,2364736,Alana,"This is a very well-located but tiny studio in Back Bay. It was tidy and the appliances seemed new, but I would caution light sleepers that the apartment is a bit noisy - the head of the bed is pretty close to the fridge, which makes a lot of noise, and the heat system is also very noisy. If you are used to a studio, you'll be fine -- it's really no different than the noise in most hotel rooms. This is a basement apartment so doesn't get that much light, but it is on one of the nicest streets in Back Bay."
3302294,55624656,2015-12-03,48903969,Helen,"Great location within walking distance of main street for dining and shopping options. Apartment as described - small, neat, clean. Ideal for one or two persons. Love the code entry - no key to pick up or lose."
"Christopher accommodated an early bag drop request and responded quickly to pre-arrival queries.  \"",,,,,
3302294,55735347,2015-12-05,28398981,Cameron,He did a great job with explaining and helping me out with the details.  He also let me show up a couple hours early to drop off my bags.
3302294,55828385,2015-12-06,8066421,Sara,Place was relatively true to images. Basement apartment with steep flight of stairs at entry. Well stocked kitchen. Generally tidy. Good use of small space. A few disappointments 1. Hairs on the walls in the shower (not mine). 2. Bed was uncomfortable up most of the night (and I can sleep almost anywhere) 3. Poor correspondence.
Felt like a place could stop on business,watch some tv,"try to sleep and leave. I would not stay more than one night. Could use a coat of paint and some visual warmth.\"",,,
3302294,56353034,2015-12-12,4113893,Mira,"I had a wonderful stay at Christopher's place! It was cute and clean, easy to access and the location was perfect! I would totally recommend it to anyone looking in the area."
3302294,56794806,2015-12-18,49128857,Laetitia,The apartment is very conviently located to Newbury street full of restaurants and shopping. Easy walk to many attractions. Had a great stay.
3302294,57255121,2015-12-23,50938806,Gonzalo,"The apartment is really good, is perfect for a couple or one person. All the apartment is new and confortable. The neighborhood is awesome, you can walk to all the Boston landmarks or take the subway a couples blocks from the apartment. Thanks Christopher for hosting us."
3302294,59312396,2016-01-09,46964792,Jennifer,"Christopher's apartment was clean, quiet, and very nice! Its location was also very convenient, and there was a lot to do around the neighborhood. Everything was as described in the ad. His instructions were also very clear and saved us from running into any trouble. If I am ever in Boston again, I will definitely look for Christopher's home! I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone looking for a safe, enjoyable stay in Boston."
3302294,60033061,2016-01-18,6397027,David,"The studio apartment, located on lovely Marlborough street is very centrally located to newbury street and copley plaza.  It is a bit small, so I would recommend no more than 2 people staying there. As for the apartment itself, it is very clean, quiet, and charming. The only thing is that there was no body wash, but that is no big deal. Parking is for residents only, but we were able to find a parking spot at North End Boston and leave it there for the entire weekend. I would recommend staying here."
3302294,61350885,2016-02-02,4071510,Simmone,"I was really impressed by the apartment and how well suited it was for a business traveler. It was tidy and relaxing with everything I needed for a quick, last-minute stay. Chris accepted my booking immediately, which was a relief since it was the evening before my arrival. There isn't much feedback I could give feedback I could give for improvements as it was perfectly suited for my needs!"
3302294,63505008,2016-02-23,5355009,Trish,"Thanks Chris for having us! The Back Bay location was perfect, having not known anything about Boston previously! If you have a car like us, I would not recommend this neighborhood however as the parking inspectors are out in force - we got 2 tickets in one evening."
"The flat itself was very comfortable and provides us with everything we needed. Very clean also!\"",,,,,
3302294,63933931,2016-02-28,57615558,Julia,Christopher was quick to reply and very courteous. Clean space and nicely located for tourism!
3302294,64117603,2016-02-29,1579304,Nathan,"Excellent location, beautiful place, great communication, highly recommend!"
3302294,65178606,2016-03-11,41635507,Khalil,The apartment is centrally located in a nice and quite neighborhood. The small space is well utilized and Christopher promptly responded to my messages.
"The main disappointment point is the very noisy and loud air heating system that keeps waking me up at night.\"",,,,,
3302294,66545372,2016-03-23,23381991,Janina,"I stayed at Christopher's place for five nights and it was perfect for what we needed! We had never been to Boston before, so although the apartment turned out to be slightly smaller than expected, we didn't mind because we had planned to be out and about all day. An unexpected appraisal came up during our trip and he needed the apartment vacant, but gave us a $50 credit back for the inconvenience. He responded to any questions prior to the trip in a very timely fashion (normally immediately). Absolutely perfect location, beautiful street, close to a million and one things to do! Happy with our stay!"
3302294,66950284,2016-03-25,63529095,Cathy,"This was our first Airbnb and it was a great experience. The location was fantastic. A beautiful quiet neighborhood only two blocks from Newbury. It was clean and simple. Parking was not available on site but plenty of parking garages. Expensive but certainly no different than staying in a downtown hotel. Christopher did a good job answering all of our questions and quickly. The one and only complaint was that the apartment was hot. But after talking to him, we understood he had no control over that since it was building controlled. We recommend this location."
3302294,67255290,2016-03-27,5501101,Nouha,"Very clean appartment with all convenience. The neighborhood is amazing, you can visit the area without taking any transportation. I high my recommend you this appartment!!"
3302294,68142432,2016-04-02,21142093,Donna,"Chris's place was a great pier de tere.  Cozy, clean and in a wonderful neighborhood.  Very comfortable bed.  I'd definitely stay there again."
3302294,68309947,2016-04-04,11901030,Amit,"Nice, clean flat in an excellent location. Also very warm and cosy, perfect considering it snowed while we were there."
3302294,68701285,2016-04-06,1801276,Delanie,"I'm generally very laid back and don't complain, however, don't mess with my sleep, and don't mess with my comfort. This apartment did both."
Apparently,the thermostat is a decoration. It does nothing. I tried. (The temp also showed about 67 degrees--there is NO way!!),,,,
The apartment was absolutely uncomfortably baking my whole 48 hours there. My friend stopped by and she keeps her own home a ghastly 75 degrees,and this place was too hot for her!,,,,
Both nights I slept fitfully and sweaty in 2-3 hour bursts and only got slight relief by opening the front door for 5 mins to cool off. I admit I run warmer than some,but it's never been a problem when there's a thermostat to adjust.,,,,
(The windows are hard to reach and the screen was out so leaves and street trash blew in when opened),,,,,
The bed is memory foam so...a giant heat sponge.,,,,,
There is a fan,but to blow around hot air?,,,,
Also,I stay at AirBNB apartments to try and get that cozy,at home feeling. This apartment has the atmosphere warmth of a business traveler hotel.,,,
"I have loved all my previous AirBNB experiences. This one...not so much. #fail\"",,,,,
3302294,70000621,2016-04-15,66557200,Laura,"Great location on a beautiful, quiet street.  If you're only planning on sleeping here, as we were, you'll be good (although it was stifling hot at times and the temp. couldn't be adjusted). However, the apartment wasn't nicely furnished, and could have used a small sofa and coffee table -- only had 2 mismatched chairs in the small entry area -- and the bathroom was extremely small.  Very dark, also, in that it was below ground."
3302294,70135143,2016-04-16,30861205,Mike,Not a great stay as
-        There was no door between the kitchen and the bedroom and was listening to the humming of the fridge all night,,,,,
-        There was a curtain/ blind missing on the door so people could see me in my bed,,,,,
-        The neighbours upstairs started to play loud music at 11.45 pm,,,,,
"Although mentioned not having internet was not great\"",,,,,
3302294,70641310,2016-04-19,45170587,Elizabeth,Great location (just blocks from marathon expo and finish) and charming street. The space was small but fine for just a couple.  We didn't spend a lot of time just hanging out but it worked fine as a home base for a busy weekend.
"Our only complaint was the shower drained very slowly. \"",,,,,
3302294,71695564,2016-04-27,40811837,Ben,"Christopher was great at getting back to us and accommodating small changes we needed to make, like moving the time we could drop off our bags and check out. The apartment was fantastic for our purposes - we were in Boston for a few days to explore and just needed a place to park our luggage and sleep at night. The street outside is charming and quiet and the location is about as good as you can get in the city. It was close to many restaurants and shops and only a short walk to Copley Square."
The apartment suited us,"it got a bit warm at night so we made use of the air conditioning fan in the wardrobe.\"",,,,
3302294,71864272,2016-04-29,21125572,Joel,"Great location, really in the heart of everything. Uber/cab drivers all know the street. Many things all within walking distance."
Really nice quiet neighborhood,,,,,
"Chris was really flexible and made our stay a very enjoyable one \"",,,,,
3302294,73072473,2016-05-06,65367247,Livia,Chris is a great host. Very quick to respond and proactive. The apartment is great - just as it appears and in an excellent location.
Many thanks,"Chris! \"",,,,

3302294,75205192,2016-05-19,19123461,Séverine,Appartement situé en sous-sol. Très peu de lumière malgré les photos. En effet si vous laissez les rideaux ouverts les passants vous voient.
Il manque une table et des chaises pour manger !,,,,,
Le quartier est néanmoins superbe. De fait l'emplacement est idéal.,,,,,
Quant à Christopher nous ne l'avons jamais vu.,,,,,
"Impossible d'en dire plus sur notre hôte. L'entrée et la sortie de l'appartement se fait via un code.\"",,,,,

3302294,76644713,2016-05-28,23189547,Jennifer,"I stayed in Christopher's apartment while attending a conference at the Sheraton (near the Prudential Center). It was a great choice! After being cooped up in meeting rooms all day, it was so nice to get outside and walk to the apartment. The neighborhood is really nice, and there are lots of shops, restaurants, and bars nearby. It is also really close to the Park by the Charles River. Christopher was flexible with check in, and provided really clear instructions for everything."
3302294,78129160,2016-06-05,63384361,Irene,"El barrio es muy tranquilo, la estadía perfecta. No tuve ningún problema. Sólo la cortina que cubre la puerta se cae a menudo porque es pesada y larga, pero es un detalle menor sin importancia, en general todo fue excelente."

3302294,80338332,2016-06-17,6890521,Benjamin,"A really nice apartment in a beautiful part of Boston. Short stroll to Newbury St shopping and supermarket and gym at the Prudential Center on Boylston St. Very quiet, good facilities and Christopher was on call for any questions. Was in Boston for work at BU, was ideal. Highly recommended."
3302294,80665274,2016-06-19,14841198,Jennifer,"The apartment was just as described - small yet cute and space was utilized well. The neighborhood was really quiet and in walking distance to lots of restaurants, shopping, and major attractions. Would stay here again when visiting Boston!"
3302294,82617390,2016-06-28,9202980,Martyn,cozy basement apartment on a very nice and quiet street.... convenient location.. Christopher was a great host who left clear instructions and answered questions promptly..would definitely recommend go stay here when in Boston

3302294,85684672,2016-07-12,23253842,Janice,Excellent location in quiet neighborhood close to everything in beautiful Back Bay.  But the apartment was dark and a bit dated overall. Overall very tiny bathroom that was difficult to navigate. Wonderful host and very efficient in and out.
3302294,87276432,2016-07-19,77614874,Todd,Great place. Perfect for what we needed.

3302294,89219044,2016-07-27,1579509,Johnny,Loved this space. Really well kept and clean. Easy access to anywhere in Boston. All of the great food and shopping is a few stumbles away. For 1 or 2 people there isn't a better option for affordable temporary living in the city.
3302294,89931964,2016-07-30,65251392,Jacqueline,"The place is cute and quaint. It's the perfect size apartment  to drop your bags and get a good nights sleep. The location was in the center of everything you would want to do in Boston. A short walk to the Back Bay or even Boston Common. The only two things that were downsides about the apartment were that when you walked down the stairs to the front door there were swarms of flies. (Most likely due to the warm weather) Also the shower was very slow to drain, so if you take a shower longer than 5 minutes be careful not to let the water overflow the basin. Otherwise I would stay here again!"
3302294,91555653,2016-08-05,18661546,Zhen,Great place in a lovely area!
3302294,92105067,2016-08-07,79358891,Jordana,"The space was lovely. Chris was easily accessible, friendly, and helpful after an initial snag (the cleaner did not show up between guests, and the previous tenants had left the apartment extremely messy, giving us a bit of a shock on arrival; we contacted Chris, who was very readily accessible by phone, and the issue was resolved by the time we returned after our evening plans)"
3302294,95176353,2016-08-18,13459721,Deborah,"Absolutely wonderful location. Beautiful street, easy walking access to subway, Commons, Newbury, Prudential. Bathroom is nicely equipped but very small. Kitchen is not well equipped and there is no closet or place for clothes other than suitcase. Perfect for those wanting to enjoy Boston and environs."

The whole place is super—neat and cozy. The location is definitely a strong advantage, especially for those who love Italian cuisine (u won't find a better place to stay in Boston). Tayler was very friendly and communicative throughout the whole process of booking—stay. And do follow her reccomendations on the places to visit in the neighbourhood, they must be seen. I would highly recommend this place for anyone travelling to Boston."

11229070,66901574,2016-03-25,28107925,Linda,"The apartment was clean, comfortable, and very well located.  The North End is wonderful, but often loud.  An added bonus of Tayler's place is the fact that the bedroom looks out onto inner courtyards rather than the street, so is very quiet.  Tayler was very accommodating with check-in and was a gracious host."
11229070,67537811,2016-03-30,44861394,Matt,We had a great experience with Tayler. Her place was right next to a bunch of restaurants and bars and was very clean. Tayler was very nice and helpful and gave us a great restaurant recommendation for dinner.

The apartment was neat and clean, with a great bed and hot shower. The is relevant it snowed in April!  The North End location was perfect, because I was attending events at TD garden arena. The TD, the Freedom Trail, many historical sites, and the BEST  Italian food was were all in walking distance. Tayler  is a nice person and made me feel welcome."

Regarding some unexpected issues,we were very late behind our scheduled check-in time,however Tayler kept waiting for us until 11pm. When the door was open,she gave us a bright smiles rather than claims. She also shared some interesting place hints,which was helpful to tourists like us.,
The house is located in the central of little Italy,North end. So it is convenience to get the famous sites on foot – surely it might be better if you rent a bike here.,,,,
"Anyway it is a great experience to meet Tayler at AirBNB.\"",,,,,

We had great pre-communication as well as throughout our stay.,,,,,
The apartment was just perfect for what we needed! Very clean and uncluttered! City building exterior with a very modern interior feel. There was even a dog bed for our boy!,,,,,

7749568,64654832,2016-03-06,58862550,Taylor,"Had a great experience at Loren's place! It was charming, clean and spacious! My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by a kind welcome card, a list of places to eat or go out for a drink, and she even stocked a mini fridge full of water bottles and craft beer that we were asked to help ourselves to! This beautiful apartment made all parts of Boston accessible. We chose to do a lot of walking but there are plenty of taxis and a train station steps away. Loren was attentive and accommodative before, during, and after our stay. We would definitely stay here again!"
7749568,66136325,2016-03-19,63153238,Dylan,"Loren's apartment is beautiful. I stayed the night and then used it for a video shoot in the morning. The place was clean and had everything I needed. The location is great - right near the Mass Ave bridge, Newbury Street, and a short walk to public transportation. Great place to stay if you want to explore Boston!"

The furniture was set up in a way to maximize the available room. The location was perfect, located smack dab in the middle of Boston. Only a few minute walk from the tee as well!"
We were surprised by a welcome card,which was really kind and thoughtful. It was filled with suggestions of places to go depending on the type of setting we wanted to visit. We ended up going to a few of the places suggested,and they were great!,,,
"Thanks again Loren! I would definitely want to stay here again. \"",,,,,
7749568,68396249,2016-04-04,59945051,Allyson,Loren had everything ready when we arrived. She kept in constant communication with me and even checked in with us the first night to see if everything was okay. It was a great location and a beautiful clean and tidy apartment. Would highly recommend.

Lorens place was in a great location and very clean. She made sure that we had information for area and felt comfortable in apartment before she left. Loren was great in communication with us through the whole process from booking to leaving. I hope I can come back and stay again when I travel to Boston again in future.  Thanks Loren for a wonderful place stay in Boston and all your help.

Great location, blocks away from Newbury street and copley square. Loved it! Made me feel young and back in school!"
7749568,84107267,2016-07-05,28097163,Samantha,My family of four used Loren's apartment for the Fourth of July weekend and it was perfect for our needs!
The apartment is walking distance from lots including Fenway and Prudential center.  It was an easy uber ride anywhere else.,,,,,
The apartment itself was very clean and had plenty of hot water for four showers each morning.,,,,,
There was a quality mart on first floor so we were able to buy basic grocery easily.,,,,,
The host was the best host that we have ever experienced.  Loren check on us daily and gave us lots of ideas for our stay.,,,,,

7749568,86872920,2016-07-17,49368105,Brandon,Loren was ready and available at the appointed time and welcomed me to her home. Everything was spotless and comfortable.
7749568,91772889,2016-08-06,58015888,Bryan,Loren's communication was great throughout.  The place was ready on time and spotless.  Loren was also very willing to be flexible with check in and check out times.  Our overall Back Bay experience was great and in many ways this was due to the convenience of the location; it is within walking distance to everything the Back Bay has to offer and Fenway Park as well.
7749568,92043853,2016-08-07,65145033,Matthew,Loren was extremely accommodating for the check-in procedure and the apartment was extremely well maintained.
The apartment,building,neighborhood,and area could not have been better. The area is very walkable and safe. The architecture only adds to the already perfect environment. The proximity of the apartment to restaurants,stores,"and parks is magnificent. \""

The apartment is exactly as pictured and very neat/clean. She left us a list of things to do and places to eat in the city and gave clear instructions of what to do before checking out. We couldn't have asked for a better night in the city. I would 100% stay here again. The location is perfect and Tai was super accommodating. I would recommend this to anyone!

6543678,46657012,2015-09-12,43119687,Rishi,I was in Boston for a conference and all the hotels were booked up and/or super expensive.  I messaged Tai wondering if there was any chance I could rent her place and she was incredibly accommodating on such short notice to agree.  It was easy to communicate with her as she replied to all messages very quickly.  Check-in was well laid out and simple.  The place resembled the photos and was clean.  They even had complementary beer in the fridge (which I didn't drink ha ha).  It was less than $10/day to Uber to the BCEC.
6543678,49152935,2015-10-01,44029716,Harpreet,Nice and comfortable stay. We would stay here again. Tai was very accommodating with check-in and check-out.

Tai was very responsive with messages and promptly answered all our questions. We would definitely stay at Tai's place again when we visit Boston - awesome place!
6543678,51820314,2015-10-24,46555495,Scott,"Tai was quick to respond whenever I had a question. My first time airbnb so I had a few. Apartment was clean and as described, 5 minute uber to convention center where I was working for the week. Thanks!"

6543678,83884976,2016-07-04,47647615,Mareike,Es War alles super. Die Kommunikation hat super geklappt und die Lage ist perfekt. (2 min vom Strand entfernt und auch nur ein paar Gehminuten bis zu einigen Restaurants in South Boston )
6543678,90086673,2016-07-31,28341776,Josh,Tai's apartment is beautiful and easy to find. Parking is available on the street free on the weekends however I believe a resident permit is required during the week. Everything was as expected during our stay we had no problems at all. AC worked great and the bedroom was clean and comfortable. Tai was easy to communicate with and let us check in early.
6543678,95365368,2016-08-19,11337178,Betsy,"The communication was good and it is in a great area, but we had some troubles with our stay. The electricity went out in the middle of the night (so did the AC) and even though we tried, they could not get it turned back on before we had to leave for a full work day at an exhibition. So, we had to get ready in the dark with no electricity for hair/steamer/breakfast and this was the day of our main event. They then had to enter the apartment while we were out even though we rented the whole space, because they had forgotten something. Overall, the area is nice and if it hadn't been for the lack of electricity (or way to fix it) before heading to work, then I would have given a higher review."
6543678,98420071,2016-08-30,58736080,Abdullah,We liked our stay in there.
519272,12092227,2014-04-22,10974137,Katelyn,"David and Felicia made us feel so welcome, it felt like we were staying with distant relatives rather than renting from strangers!  Their home is beautiful, clean, and in a wonderful location.  We enjoyed their travel tips and the passion for their city they shared with us, and we so appreciated all the ways they went above and beyond as hosts."
519272,12519365,2014-05-04,12928544,Frenck,"David and Felicia helped us out when we had difficulty finding accommodation on short notice and it worked out great! The room was cosy and private, and the bathroom clean and neat. The hosts were extremely welcoming, friendly and helpful in many ways. Jamaica Plains has some nice pubs and restaurants and a great park next door. Within 20 minutes you are downtown Boston with public transport."
519272,12805424,2014-05-11,9243259,Mia,I and my baby sun had a graet time in this house.

519272,14536192,2014-06-21,16471357,Christine,My stay with David & Felicia worked out very well. David met me at a time that worked for both of us.  My room was very clean and charming. The private bath was very clean and easily accessible. A third room was available for reading/relaxing - a nice touch.  David was very gracious and invited me to join the evening's dinner party. I had to decline as I was off to visit my daughter and newborn granddaughter. The location was perfect for me and I hope to stay with David & Felicia on a future visit to Jamaica Plain.  Thank you.
519272,19814469,2014-09-19,13635069,Edna,We had a really good time in Felicia's and David's beautiful house in Jamaica Plain.
They both welcomed us with a cup of tea and good recommendations for places to have dinner. They also provided useful information how to navigate in the city and things worth to visit. Thanks to them I possess a beautiful new hat :-),,,,,

519272,77363954,2016-05-31,27551708,Wynn,We had the best time staying in David's house in JP. They had everything we needed and were amazing hosts. JP is also the cutest area and close to all the great spots to check out in Boston. Would definitely stay again and recommend their home to anyone going to Boston.
4653267,39011139,2015-07-20,7323908,Sheri,This is the place to stay in the North End. Hans was an incredible host and was quick to respond to any question  and was more than accommodating. His place is very quaint and clean. I look forward to coming back here next year.

13017162,75546054,2016-05-22,47868372,Sihang,"I spent three great night at the suite. It is a very good place to stay: the suite itself is very new and built in a quiet neighborhood. It is also a very convenient place if you want to travel in Boston since there is only 4min walk to Fenway station. All in all, wonderful place!"

I would definitely recommend this company and will definitely use them next time I am in Boston!"
13017162,78790243,2016-06-09,12733878,Pam,Great location literally adjacent to the Green Line and super close to Fenway.  The unit we stayed in was not the same layout as the photo.  Ours had a bar table and stools and the kitchen was all along one wall rather than galley style.  It was clean and comfortable.  Having laundry in the entry closet was great and they even included some detergent.
13017162,80127220,2016-06-16,72943758,Regina,"The apartment was beautiful and very clean and new. It was a great location too. My only complaint was that there was no one there when we arrived for check in at 4. We waited outside for 20 minutes. When a woman finally arrived she seemed irritated about having to let us in. We had to be somewhere by 4:30, so this was a pretty big let down. Other than that, everything about our stay was fabulous."

I was mis lead in thinking the place was as it looked in the photos but when I arrived Julio told me that the pictures don't represent what you get. My wife and I got a place facing a ugly wall and he said I just has to accept it because they had nothing else. I would be very cautious in renting this air bnb.
13017162,86857491,2016-07-17,74532164,Christine,"We were able to check into our suite little early, as we arrived in town, which was appreciated. Felicia gave us the rundown. The suite was clean and COOL, as it was super stifling hot outside. Towels fresh out of the dryer clean, and the apartment was immaculate. Took the refrigerator a little white to get cold, but there was plenty of ice to ride us over. All the amenities were there, and it was a nice quiet location, though out the window was great people watching.  Convenience and location were better than expected. My friend had an injured foot, but we were still able to get about easily. We would definitely come back, and recommend to friends."

13017162,91070344,2016-08-03,18454861,Ileen,"Our stay with Beantown was rather disappointing. The space was very clean, large, and modern and the host politely helped me check in although I could not locate the email instructions. Although it was a very nice place and certainly recommended for someone who might as easily enjoy a hotel room, for a seasoned Airbnb user this lacked any of the ambiance or amenities of our usual stays. There was no personality, small touches, personal interactions or gracious amenities. The supplies were parsed out- one dish washer soap ball, one small container of shampoo, no cream rinse, and one trash bag. The furniture was very uncomfortable and obviously for show not human comfort. The tiny TV was unwatchable and the lack of art or color was stark. Nothing was set up for real people, just to look good in pictures it seems. The book provided had no city ideas, warmth, local color just strict rules and consequences and instructions for using the high end appliances. As my husband said it was like staying in a Marriott without the concierge , pool and room service. The crowning insult was trying to take the trash to the trash room( without doing so there would be a fine) and having the tissue thin small bag break and cleaning garbage from the trash room floor. I would recommend this is you are looking for a hotel this is a great option. If you are looking for a classic Airbnb experience make another coice."

4314054,28061465,2015-03-16,19701324,Joshua,"Due to flight delays, I was only able to crash here for a few hours, but the room and bed were much appreciated."
4314054,28190210,2015-03-19,19701324,Joshua,"This was my second stay with Tom. I was a bit exhausted from travel, but Tom still welcomed me in. The room was the same as a few nights prior and the bed was incredibly comfortable, especially after 23 hours of travel."
4314054,29680873,2015-04-11,28575682,Michelle,Stayed here as had an early flight in the morning. Was a clean room in a shared living area. The room mates were friendly. Good for an overnight stay. Thank you Tom!
4314054,30403646,2015-04-21,5309396,Mick,"We had a very quick stay at Tom's for a layover, but it was perfect! Super close to the airport (within walking distance) and his friend Monica's restaurant La Sanghita was delicious and healthy (so much better than airport food). Thanks again so much!"
4314054,30605042,2015-04-25,21563818,Esther,"My boyfriend and I have stayed in Tom's house for a night. The private room is cozy with a large comfortable bed where you can take a good rest before your early flight or sight-seeing on the next day. There is a shared living room which you can cook at you wish with plenty of kitchenware. Or else, Maverick Square with restaurants, convenient stores and bakery etc is just within walking distance and airport is just 20 minutes by walk. The roommates of our nights were also nice and there was no such problem of queuing up for the shared washroom. Overall, we enjoyed the stay overall."
4314054,31003638,2015-04-30,2470681,Laura,Alex and I arrived very late from the airport.  when we got inside the flat we were warmly shown to our room and amenities. I chatted with tom in the morning and he was very gracious. The food at his cafe was lovely. His room mate was so kind as to give me a pound of private reserve coffee beans. We felt safe and happy to have a place to land in Boston.
4314054,31466869,2015-05-05,31087005,Mohit,"I stayed at Tom's place for two nights. The room was good, and the bed was very comfortable. The place was very close to the airport, several nearby restaurants, and a metro station, it is therefore very convenient for travellers. Tom was a good host, and made me feel very welcome."
4314054,31533690,2015-05-06,30940658,Jordan,"My wife and I did not have a great experience at this location. We had been told that a key would be in a lock box but it wasn't, after an hour and a half of waiting (and contacting airbnb) we finally got in touch with the host and were able to get in. Once inside the apartment complex smelled of smoke. The apartment was a mess and the room we stayed in was not the one pictured. It was far worse. Woke up to a cat litter box outside our door and the apartment itself smelling of smoke. We never actually met Tom, and the only time we spoke with him was after the hour and a half of waiting and him letting us know his roommate was upstairs to let us in."
This listing is certainly not family friendly as it suggests. In addition,even after all the we went through I have yet to receive any type of apology from Tom.,,,,
"Very unimpressed.\"",,,,,
4314054,31655590,2015-05-08,6638709,Kathleen,Location is perfect for transit through Logan Airport and is amazingly quiet at night. Tom is an extremely warm and welcoming host so I wish I could have stayed longer. The room was very basic but extremely clean and bed was really comfy. Would definitely recommend to others.
4314054,31951140,2015-05-12,8778006,Yue,"Tom is very welcoming and easy to communicate. Although we arrived very late at 2 am, Tom did not have a problem. The room is clean and has a super comfortable bed. it's just perfect for a layover as it is so close the the airport."
4314054,32253504,2015-05-16,30775176,Anna,"I had difficulty getting in touch with Tom to arrange picking up the keys - I had to reach out to Airbnb to get him to respond to my message. When he did respond, I asked a follow up question that was never answered. That said, once we arrived at the apartment it was easy to find the lockbox and let ourselves in. The couple of times I interacted with Tom he was very kind and welcoming."
The room itself was nice - bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size. If it's warm enough to leave the windows open,the school across the street can be very noisy during the morning weekday hours. You can't beat the location - a five minute walk to the T Maverick station,"which is one stop away from the airport and one stop away from downtown Boston. \"",,,
4314054,32341012,2015-05-17,29886639,Tom,Tom King was very accommodating. Room was as described. Neighbors very helpful. Saturday night was a bit noisy. All in all it met our needs after a 30hr return trip from Turkey..
4314054,32562366,2015-05-19,31762070,Jon,"The apartment was in a good location next to the blue line and in walking distance of the airport shuttle. We found it to be a tad warm and a bit cramped, but Tom was on time and inviting."
4314054,32639959,2015-05-19,5368833,Marvin,Tom was communicative during the entire process from reservation to check in. He let me know where the key to his place was and was there to greet me when I arrived. The room is clean and quiet.
4314054,32867570,2015-05-22,166312,Jack And Eve,"Regrettably, I did not stay with Tom.  I let him know and he was really lovely about the cancellation.  Will certainly stay with him (if he'll have me) on my next trip to Boston"
4314054,33213993,2015-05-25,12841008,Stefan,"The place is in walking distance to the airport and still very close to downtown via Metro. Communicating with Tom was really easy, no problems at all. The room is really nice, very clean. We recommend this place!"
4314054,33444214,2015-05-28,20560187,Yifan,I like the kitten in da house ;)))) So cute !
4314054,33577797,2015-05-30,19605863,Sven,"First I like to mention that Tom is a very friendly and humble host and he did his very best to accommodate us in the best possible way. I noticed that some other guests mentioned that it was hard to get in touch with him. I suggest to call him, he always got back to us within the hour (he's a busy guy, maintaining 5 other locations and shooting some videos with students so he's not always able to answer the phone right away)"
Pro's:,,,,,
- Affordable (Boston is a Creasy expensive place when it comes to hotel rooms),,,,,
- Location,5-10 minutes walk to the airport/rental car location. Ideal if you have a long layover. Also a 5-10 minutes walk to the Maverick train station (blue line) and some restaurants and grocery stores.,,,,
- Room is clean.,,,,,
Con's:,,,,,
-You share one bathroom with 4 guest rooms,,,,,
- Rooms are at the 3rd floor (top level) and can get very hot is summertime. By default there's no air conditioner or fan. According to Tom they will provide portable AC's soon (it really gets hot in the rooms so you might want to check the status first before you book).,,,,,
- If you have a lot of luggage it can be quite a hassle to bring it all up and also to store it in the room (we had 6pc and had to juggle quite a lot),,,,,
Bad:,,,,,
- During our stay there was a very present smell of marihuana in the building and in our room. We complaint about it and Tom took action towards one of the guests. Although it cleared it somewhat it was still noticeable. Same guests also created a mess in the kitchen. Problem is that these guests are there to stay for a longer while,so you might want to check on the status.,,,,
Conclusion: Tom is an awesome host,"the place is okayish but could be much better if the \"\"Bad's\"\" are fully being taken care off and some sort of cooling is provided during the summer time.\"",,,,
4314054,34113054,2015-06-05,15028524,Brooke,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4314054,34300579,2015-06-07,31475960,Luca,"Tom's place is in walking distance to the car rental of the airport. I had a great stay, although it was a little noisy on saturday night. I would definitely stay again."
4314054,34745634,2015-06-11,28363881,Lia,"Tom was a gracious host. He is very interesting to talk to and made me feel welcome. My GPS(TomTom) got me there correctly. The bed was very comfortable, and if I would not hesitate to contact him again for accommodations in the future if I come back to Boston again. Neighborhood is very tight row houses. Glad there was a fan in the room, as it was a very warm night."

4314054,36268886,2015-06-27,27273482,Verena,Tom was a nice host and we felt very welcome. The room is clean and the mattress comfortable. The location is in walking distance to the airport and only 2 stations with the T to the city center. Made it perfect for us :)
4314054,36751469,2015-06-30,191251,Nathan,"Avoid if your sensitive to cat dander or cigarette smoke. Room was clean, common area was... collegiate? Comfortable bed and hot shower with good water pressure. Tom answered my first call and was helpful."
4314054,37177438,2015-07-05,34232365,Duane,Tom was a great host.  Gracious with my need for a late check-out.  Plenty of privacy.  Convenient to the airport.  Close to the T subway.
4314054,37933841,2015-07-11,6459610,Brian,"Nice, clean, quiet, comfortable room & apt. Take the embassy suites shuttle instead of the rental car. ;-) the building entryway and hallways are a bit dark & damp & you have to walk up 3 flights of stairs but other than that it was great for the money."
4314054,38039172,2015-07-12,37039834,Deb,"Tom met us at the front door and showed us through the apartment. He was gracious and accommodating. This was our first experience with Airbnb so we were cautious about participating. Some of the other guests had traveled extensively with Airbnb with mostly great results, so we look forward to the next time we can use Airbnb"
4314054,38421900,2015-07-15,33465666,Yangjun,Tom is a gracious host and provided a small bed to my kid. The apartment is very close to airport. Glad there was a fan in the room since a hot night. Tom also prepared water to drink for us. A pleasant experience for our first time use of air nob.
4314054,39555739,2015-07-24,33126006,Dian,The guest room that we were staying is clean and fine. We enjoy talking with Tom and feel welcomed here.
4314054,39744221,2015-07-26,9694045,Julien,We spent a great time at Tom's. He was a pleasant host and took time to discuss with us. The apartment is very close to the airport and in a pleasant neighbourhood.
4314054,40261597,2015-07-29,17377356,Rashida,Place was ok.
4314054,40400864,2015-07-30,32452648,Barry,Very close to airport. Convenient because I got n on a late flight -- 11 pm. I took  Uber to Cottage Street room. Comfortable bed and air conditioning. Tom is a very gracious host.

4314054,40660878,2015-08-01,38860890,Rachel,"Tom was hard to get ahold of initially, but the room was comfortable and close to the airport ($15 cab ride). He had just purchased a new memory foam mattress. His apartment is on the third floor through both of the doors - there are no apartment numbers listed."
4314054,41209549,2015-08-05,19481978,Christina,"Our stay was uncomplicated, we found everything well and Tom is an easy-going guy. For us it was great, that the airport is really close. We walked from there in just 10 minutes. Perfect, if you have a stop-over in Boston."
4314054,41678878,2015-08-08,2778214,Danielle And Eric,"We booked this room because it was the least expensive option anywhere near the Boston Logan Airport. For a night or two, it is comfortable enough. It isn't very family friendly, though -- we didn't feel safe in the neighborhood at night, the common areas of the building smell like pot, and we didn't feel comfortable leaving any valuables in the room. We were also sorry that our baby was crying in the night because sound really travels to the other rooms. However, the room was clean and the host was friendly. All in all, the listing description is accurate and we were satisfied with our experience."
4314054,42346406,2015-08-12,40609283,Amy,"We had a great stay with Tom. The location is excellent, very close to the airport with easy access to downtown. There's a free shuttle bus you can take from the airport to the Embassy hotel, which is close to Tom's place. Our bed was very comfortable, and the air conditioner was awesome for the warm summer night. Tom was a great host, offering us pleasant conversation and lots of touristic information."
4314054,43284139,2015-08-18,143232,Autumn,"Comfortable bed, room was clean, location was convenient. Our only complaint was that a lot of people seem to be living or staying there, so it was a little noisy and there is only one bathroom, so we usually had to wait to use it. Overall this is a good and convenient option in an otherwise expensive area!"
4314054,43555771,2015-08-20,40800225,Julie,"I loved the room and cute neighborhood.  Tom was out of town, but quickly rang me and helped navigate me. Super grateful for the stay!"

4314054,44582799,2015-08-27,11020124,Annabel,"Very comfortable and clean room in a quiet neighborhood close to the airport. I couldn't hear any planes, so that was good. Tom was very accomodating when I showed up early and the atmosphere was relaxed and friendly. Everyone keeps to themselves but are around if you need help."
4314054,44800467,2015-08-29,10448723,Amila,Tom was very responsive and helpful. We came in very late as our flight landed after 11pm. Tom worked with us and helped us get to the place and our room. We only stayed for one night but the room was as described and what we needed for our trip.
4314054,45432461,2015-09-02,42413347,Vincent,"Friendly host, clean room, nice furnishings and comfortable bed. Room is equivalent to 2 1/2 to 3 star hotel. Easy to get key and access. Room is on the third or top floor. neighborhood is close into the north end. Its a lower end neighborhood and a little messy on the streets but that's a small price to pay for the value of this room and location"
4314054,46589847,2015-09-12,30066168,David,Tom is a very friendly and approachable gent! The room and property were exactly as per the description.

"Thanks Tom!\"",,,,,
4314054,47306915,2015-09-17,28436869,Jacqueline,The host was welcoming at unsocial hours which is very helpful.  Text and emails received promptly.   Very convenient from the airport and good advise to use hotel shuttle
4314054,47385060,2015-09-18,7058937,Carlos,Room was clean and had AC. The entire building had an interesting aroma.

4314054,48102480,2015-09-23,2623850,Ashley & Derek,"Tom was very friendly and a great host, but the situation wasn't what we expected: he rents out 4 bedrooms in a small turn-of-the-century apartment. When we arrived there was such a strong smell of marijuana (from another guest) that I felt sick to my stomach, and people came and went loudly late at night and early in the morning. Also, all 4 bedrooms share one tiny bathroom, so you might wait in line at 1:30 in the morning. (You also might see guests repeatedly coming out of the bathroom in their underwear, as we did.) With that kind of high-traffic place, cleanliness was also something of an issue. It's convenient to the airport so if you need a quick cheap place to crash, go for it - just be aware that you're getting what you paid for/ that the experience may vary wildly. I wouldn't stay again."
4314054,48314136,2015-09-25,43134980,Yunzhi,"Tom is so nice!he brought us to shopping mall and the shuttles station,we appreciate it a lot!the house is located near the airport .the house is closed to downtown as well,about 2stops,we enjoyed a lot!"
4314054,48566679,2015-09-27,20161162,Katrina,"Pros: The room was clean, comfortable and very convenient for airport travel. We were able to check in late and a window air conditioner was present (which was very helpful for drowning out noise). Cons: The one available/shared bathroom was not very clean. Overall worth the money we saved."
4314054,48915906,2015-09-29,24196256,Nicola,"We stayed at Tom's apartment for two nights. He is such a friendly and openminded person. He answers all of our questions detaily. Our room was nice and clean. The bathroom could be cleaner but it was ok. We get up early in the morning each day, so there were no problems to get into the bathroom."
Thank you for hosting us,"Tom! \"",,,,
4314054,49239781,2015-10-02,42733514,Matt,"Tom was a good host, very friendly and helpful in answering questions about the area. We arrived after midnight and were able to get in with no problem. Very easy walk from blue line station, which you can take the airport shuttle to get to if you are coming into town via airport. One note: When we got in, there were 2 rooms marked as being for AirBNB guests, so we guessed. Wrong, unfortunately, as we woke up someone in the other room. We stood outside Room 2 worried about being in the right spot. Not a huge deal, but may want to ask ahead of time exactly what room you will be located in."
All-in-all,this was a good first experience with AirBNB,thanks to Tom and his hospitality.,,,

4314054,49379570,2015-10-03,7363178,Patrick,Tom was a very nice guy who was very accommodating. The bed and room were clean and it was close to the airport. The building itself was in need of some cleaning. It is definitely more of a hostel like environment. Worked for us for the one night we were there.

The place was exactly what you need for an overnight stay and it's perfectly located between the airport and the car rental place. If I find myself again in need of a place in Boston I will be coming back.
4314054,50314589,2015-10-11,43535794,Zhengdong,I booked this place for my friend. He had a great time here. The location is very close to Logan airport. Hosts are very nice. He's very satisfied.
4314054,50701040,2015-10-13,43478476,Alexandra,"We stayed at Tom's for one night after we got to Boston by bus. Tom was very helpful and quickly showed us around when we got there. The room was nice and clean, provided with towels and a good bed. It was very easy to get downtown by metro and even easier to get to the airport the next day. Tom gave us clear directions, stored our luggage for a couple of hours and was even so kind to help us getting our boarding passes. While we stayed at Tom's there were some other airbnb-ers aswell but they kept to themselves and weren't of any distburance. There is one bathroom for all rooms so that could get crowded but for us it was no problem. Thanks again Tom!"

Several rooms in the unit, all sharing one rather small bathroom, which still worked out OK for us."
"Unit is on third floor with steep steps. Nevertheless it worked well for a relatively economical last-night stay very near the Logan airport.\"",,,,,

My husband and I needed a place to lay our heads for a couple of hours as I had a very early flight the next morning and we did get in late as well. Tom gave us pretty good instructions on how to find the place, although we did get a little confused as to which door it was in the building and we weren't sure where the bathroom was in the apartment."

His home is easily walkable from Boston-Logan (take the terminal shuttle bus to the airport train station and walk for 15-20 minutes). Tom had plenty of good intel on nearby restaurants both for dinner and breakfast the next morning and was pleasant and polite in providing it. La Sanghita Cafe, the affiliated restaurant, is also fantastic."

4314054,53897214,2015-11-14,3961331,Lucie,"Tom's place is a really good choice when you want to spend some time in Boston. Even though we were there just for 1 night, it was a pleasant experience. The bed is EXTREMELY comfortable, the room is clean and looks exactly as (URL HIDDEN) for light sleepers: the house makes a lot of noises itself and you can also hear when someone is walking in the hall by the room. So earbuds would be a good idea maybe :)"
"But I would definitely recommend this place!\"",,,,,
4314054,54128575,2015-11-16,46334817,Michael,"Overall I had an enjoyable time, although it was more of a very expensive Couchsurfing experience than what I have come to expect from an Air BnB. The room was exactly as pictured and described. The bed was very comfortable and there were plenty of blankets and towels. As a previous lodger pointed out, the house is very creaky and the one bathroom is very small. Tom, the host seems like a nice guy but he is a morning person so expect to hear him by 7 am."
Make sure you get explicit instructions from Tom on how to get inside the apartment. I won't go into details here but make sure he tells you exactly where the key lock box is and which room is yours (they aren't numbered). The apartment is on the third floor and if you get there after dark,the only light past the entrance is a 60 watt bulb in a work light on the third floor. Kinda sketchy.  Parking SUCKS! Get there early or you may not find a place anywhere near the apartment.,,,,
"The Maverick Street Market is a great place for breakfast and coffee and is only a 3 minute walk. There are a bunch of other restaurants in the same area.\"",,,,,
4314054,54340964,2015-11-18,16224002,Carolyn,"The building was easy to find, though the listing doesn't say there is a narrow staircase, and that's on the third floor."
I got in late from Southern Massachusetts,and just needed a place to lay my head for the night before my early flight. The bed is SO comfortable!! I slept the whole night. The water was hot,only one other room was occupied during my stay and there was no fighting over the bathroom.,,,
The house,but not the room,smelled like cigarettes,which is fine,as my parents both smoke,so it was fine for me
I was a little confused about which door to go in (I blame my insane travel schedule) and Tom answered the phone right away and opened it for me. It wasn't too late,"I was just not sure!! He was very welcoming. \"",,,,
4314054,54376290,2015-11-19,19238461,Yuika,"Tom is a wonderful host, full of wit and humor. His own short films are so beautiful (you can ask him if you're interested!) The room is clean and cozy, i hope to stay again :)"
4314054,54446007,2015-11-20,45625746,Haruka,"Tom was really nice person. I was little nervous before I see him because this was my first time using Airbnb. But he welcomed me warmly so my worry left soon after I met him. The room was clean, and I felt really comfortable being there. As I talk him a lot, I come to like him more. Thank you so much Tom!"
4314054,54929188,2015-11-25,18732582,Meredith,Tom was very welcoming and easy to work with.  We enjoyed our room as well as watching Netflix in the living room.  The location was great as we could walk places and to train.
4314054,55009286,2015-11-27,545823,Noah,No contact even after the introductory email. First time from an AirBNB host.
4314054,55225839,2015-11-29,30320519,Chi,"My stay was amazing. Tom was such a friendly host and his room was so comfy (memory foam, yes). It's only a short walk from the T and not that far from center Boston. The neighborhood was so cute and safe, I didn't even want to leave. Would definitely stay at his place next time I'm in Boston."
4314054,55403861,2015-12-01,46863739,Steve,Tom has been very kind and gave me useful information for my stay.
4314054,55499820,2015-12-01,48879667,Timothy,Really like this place. Clean sheets and very comfortable bed. The owner gives me great tips on how to goes around the area and catch shuttle to the airport. Really friendly guy.
4314054,55670408,2015-12-04,30354193,Angel,"Tom is really a nice host and always willing to help. His place is comfy, clean and very close to subway station(around 10 mins walk). It's my first time using Airbnb but he makes me feel like I'm home. Highly recommend!"

4314054,56294156,2015-12-11,51020780,Eric,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4314054,56395659,2015-12-13,38578562,Minhui,Tom's room is very close  to the airport and very clean also. Although there is something wrong  with the heater and no hot warter served on that day. I feel good when he told me in advance. Thank you Tom.

4314054,58096954,2015-12-31,51475159,Leo,"The place is right next to the airport so it's very convenient for travelers. There's a T station five minutes walk away from it that can basically get you anywhere you want. The room itself is perfect - Tom puts in a lot of effort making it look like a hotel room, and also provides clean towels and stuff. Tom is a very accomplished guy, and fairly easy to talk to. He's always done to share his stories and give advice on things to check out. Anyway, it is a place I would recommend to my friends who are visiting Boston looking for a reasonable place to stay."
4314054,58850112,2016-01-05,34487423,Anne,"Tom is an experienced air b and b host and a very interesting guy. He was helpful and gave information regarding maps and tourist attractions.Very convenient to the Mavarick Subway. The room was as pictured, small but adequate and we were welcome to use the kitchen freely. The B and B was busy with the other guest rooms also occupied during our stay. Outside the temperatures were very COLD nut the apartment was warm and cosy."
4314054,59097516,2016-01-06,52556309,Angie,Tom was very kind and welcoming. The room was neat and tidy. We definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Boston for a day to two.

4314054,59694062,2016-01-14,48636023,Casey,"Stayed here 3 nights with my boyfriend to explore Boston for our first time. While we weren't in the heart of the city, it was very easy to get anywhere via the T. The room was small but comfortable and we could come and go at our leisure. Would definitely recommend for someone looking for an affordable place to stay with a short walk to the airport."
4314054,59987961,2016-01-17,31597510,Charles,j'ai vraiment eu la sensation d'etre accueilli à la maison et la chambre était très propre. Tom connait très bien sa ville et sa maison est idéalement située pour qui veut se rendre à l'aeroport.

"Host is a phenomenal person!\"",,,,,
4314054,61116561,2016-01-31,34541511,Balint,"The place is in a quiet and calm neighborhood in East Boston just a short walk away from the tram that takes you right into the city center in 10 minutes. The room is small but comfortable, and, as the rest of the house, clean and has a kind of warm atmosphere."
Tom was very welcoming and communicative from the first second on,"and he is quite knowledgeable in a variety of fields and topics which only adds to his great storytelling skills :) \"",,,,

4314054,65104699,2016-03-10,2143004,Ann,"Tom's room was comfortable, clean and cozy. As others have mentioned, his room is very near and convenient to BOS; Uber can be there in a jiffy to give you a ride (or Lyft, I think, as well.) My first night there, he directed me to a vegan/vegetarian/non-GMO restaurant owned and run by his friend, Monica. Delicious, healthy offerings there. But it's the friendship and sense of community that give this space its uniqueness. Time for me to go ~ I found myself a little too comfortable in the TV room, binge-watching the last season of House of Cards! Had to get up and go! Learned so much while there; Tom teaches, and isn't stingy about giving free seminars to his guests -- or maybe I just came at an opportune time. Thanks so much for the extras, Tom."
4314054,65272110,2016-03-12,25718273,Wenjun,"The apartment building has easy access to the metro station and is super close to the airport. The description of the room is accurate. Moreover, Tom is a fun host to chat with and get tips on traveling/dining in East Boston and Boston in general! Tom also offered to help me move my heavy suitcase as I head out for the airport. I am grateful for Tom's help. Overall, I had a great stay."

4314054,66100816,2016-03-19,38823387,Alexander,"I stayed at Tom's place for one night during a layover in Boston, which I used to explore the city. Tom was an outstanding host. He took the time to explain me everything I should see in Boston and was very helpful to me. The place has a great location in walking distance to the airport and to the public transport. The neighborhood is really quiet and nice. I can highly recommend staying with Tom."

We had an early morning flight to catch (5 am) and it was easy to navigate to the airport from Tom's place. Also, Tom helped us with the numerous enquiries that we had about the journey to the airport and town. A few metro stations were near his place and the journey to Boston city centre was hassle free."
4314054,68197696,2016-04-02,46656888,Mike,"Tom was a wonderful host.  Room was simple, clean and Tom was thoughtful to have a separate lock/key for it.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe.  Being so close to the airport was a major plus!"

Decent accommodation for an overnight layover. We didn't spend much time there since it was a quick stop, but Tom was friendly."
4314054,69679302,2016-04-12,2722907,Cindy,I didn't get a chance to meet him due to my arrival time and that's one of the things i liked about him (didn't have a check in time). I also liked that he let my friend sleep on the couch due to a last minute arrangement needed. Tom was  also great with communicating with me every time I had a question. I would recommend his place to anyone that needs a quick place to stay/sleep near the airport.
4314054,70467120,2016-04-18,48596572,Robert,Tom was a great host and provided lots of helpful information about getting around the city.

Dropped off the rental car and walked back. On the way,we stopped by Tom's recommended vegan restaurant - La Sanghita. This is the best vegan food we've ever had. The people at the restaurant are amazing - they really care about what goes into the food they make.,,,,

4314054,84853082,2016-07-09,56952485,Andie,"Tom was a great host and the location was perfect, just a few minutes walk from the airport (the free shuttle bus takes you out of the airport complex) and the room had everything I needed for a comfortable nights sleep before a connection the next morning."

4314054,89154054,2016-07-27,45375646,Niels,"Tom reminded me of a personal friend, both in terms of life story and appearance. And to be accurate, that's a pleasant similarity and I therefore did - although it was shortly - enjoy my chats with him on various topics."
Besides Tom,the room was all I needed and more. I wanted a clean quiet room to retract in,and got that with keys and all. What I didn't assume was to be able to use his entire kitchen,grab the foods stuffed in the fridge and on the table,"so that generous edge totally made it for me.\"",
4314054,89323999,2016-07-28,24370996,Heather,"Tom was a great host! He was very accommodating and the apartment was very nice and clean. It was a very simple check-in/check-out process.

The room itself isn't near the hustle and bustle of the main of Boston,but it's easily within a few minutes of the train + bus station,which is incredibly easy to figure out - it's also within walking distance of plenty of places to eat,convenience stores,"and a few parks. Overall during our time there (2 days) we ended up walking around 24 miles - so there is absolutely plenty to do and see.\"",

4314054,92038033,2016-08-07,9704787,Susan,"Tom was very friendly and helpful. He even carried my very heavy suitcase up 3 flights of stairs. The room is very basic but clean. The neighborhood is in the inner city but I felt safe walking from Logan's car rental before dark. This was the most I've paid for a room, but if you need to stay minutes from Logan -- it works."
4314054,92718509,2016-08-09,68110397,Victor,Tom is a really nice an talkative guy. He makes you feel really comfortable as soon as you enter the door of the house. The room was clean and he provided towels and access to kitchen and bathroom plus he stored the luggage to a later pickup. Really recommendable!
4314054,93353393,2016-08-12,4385563,Paul,"Tom was a fantastic host and came down to greet me upon arrival. The location is perfect meeting all of my criteria of being within a short walk of transit, running options (track and waterfront!) and even the airport. Wow. Room is relatively simple, but fine sleeping and zipping in and out for a business trip."
4314054,93967091,2016-08-14,84954443,Mariah,We had a great time in Boston. Tom is very nice and the apartment is cozy. It's a 10 minute walk from the train station which we used to get to many places. The guidebook Tom has put together is very useful and helped us find things to do in the city.
4314054,94910427,2016-08-17,87671007,Souban Zayeem,"The place is great. It's a calm and peaceful neighbourhood that's just a few minutes walk from the train station. It's very close to the airport too, about a 10 min drive at the most. You will be sharing the whole floor with guests in two other rooms, so keep in mind that the bathroom may not be as clean as you would like at all times. Tom's a brilliant host; approachable, interesting and very fun to have a conversation with. I wish I had more time to speak with him and been lucky enough to spend some more time with the cat living downstairs. In all, it's a satisfactory stay for the price you will be paying."
4314054,95256937,2016-08-19,57288744,Sake Jan,"Prima plek om te overnachten. Het is vlak bij de metro, dus je bent net zo makkelijk in de stad als op het vliegveld."
4314054,95378921,2016-08-19,21788325,Montia,"Tom is incredibly gracious and flexible. He was super understanding of the late check-in needed due to a flight delay. The room was clean, comfortable and the a/c crisp and cold despite the muggy August weather. Great location for an airport stay with wifi and comfortable bed."
4314054,96445533,2016-08-22,85992524,Katie,"Tom was a fantastic host. Very friendly and talkative. He is passionate about his work, people, and the city of Boston. He is very knowledgable about the surrounding areas. Very clean living space in rooms with AC. Felt very comfortable and welcomed. Easy walk to the T for a short trip into the city!"

The area was very clean and ready for a guest. Mini fridge and microwave in the room was great. They have taken the time to place personal touches throughout the area,tons of little items to make the stay enjoyable. I visit Boston regularly,"I hope to stay with Gwen and Michael again. \"",,,

The kitchen has everything that you need. The property is located on a quiet street in a very beautiful area of Boston. A 2 min walk will give you access to public transport.

The place was perfect for the two of us and was in a great location. Very easy to hop onto the subway and get around the city. Great experience -- we would definitely stay here again!"
5661246,33015038,2015-05-24,22169285,Jennifer,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Mark's Private Studio Apartment during memorial day weekend.  Mark was a great host.  He was very communicative and easy to get in contact with.  The room is in a good location.  It is walking distance to coffee shops, restaurants, and stores, plus it is very easy to hop on the subway and travel to other parts of the city.  If you are looking for a place with lots of bells and whistles this is not it.  It is simply a room with a futon, a kitchenette, a mini fridge and a full bath attached.  It is a perfect place if you need a place to sleep, store you things, and shower while you are exploring Boston."
5661246,33519904,2015-05-29,30923232,Nick,"good neighborhood, nice folks. They were informative upon arrival and then kept to themselves. Pretty close to the schools which helped me. Still took forever to get anywhere but thats just Boston traffic i guess."
5661246,33942657,2015-06-02,32769832,Gaël,"The flat was simple, but comfortable. The hosts were charming. The neighboorhood is quiet but still quite lively. The only down side was that the green line to go downtown is so slow."
5661246,36161184,2015-06-25,10877337,Elliott,Great stay in an old college neighborhood of mine! Very clean and modern. Liked the location a lot. For Allston it definitely is a deal!
5661246,37885747,2015-07-11,8890910,Paul,"The owners of the apartment made us feel right at home. We arrived and got into the apartment no problem. We were worried about there not being an air conditioner (what with it being Boston in the summer) but it was cool enough down there (the ac seems to seep from upstairs) and the fan at night was sufficient. The location is great too, right near Harvard/Comm for B line and the 57 bus in case you actually want to get somewhere in a timely fashion. We stayed 3 nights which was probably all we could stand on the futon. It was fine for a night or two but by the third night we were very much looking forward to a real bed. That being said, there is a tv with tons of channels and your own entrance so for the price it is a good deal, especially if you're looking to enjoy Allston's night-life offerings."
5661246,38083328,2015-07-12,37045078,Edcel,"Simple basement studio a block away from metro, restaurants, and shops. Mark was easy to communicate with and seems like he up keeps the apartment regularly. Would recommend if you're looking for a no frills place to crash for the night."
5661246,38962626,2015-07-19,263394,Lori,"My husband and I needed a place to stay for the night and Mark's place was just perfect!  There are tons of things to do in the immediate area and access to the T was only about a block away.  The apartment was really clean and looked exactly like it does in the pictures.  The apartment stayed nice and cool even though it was really humid outside.  I did not meet Mark, but met Roman and his wife who live above the apartment and they were the sweetest people ever!  Roman showed us the apartment and made sure we were all set.  Next time we are in Boston for a night or two we will be back.  Thank you for renting to us."
5661246,44429063,2015-08-26,36392742,Mitchell,"Staying at Mark's place was great.  While totally affordable, I found the apartment to be totally comfortable with all the necessary amenities.  Particularly useful was a microwave, a refrigerator, and a kitchenette.  Also the TV has any channel you might want to watch if that's your thing."
Mark made me feel totally welcome and at ease.  He was extremely accommodating with my check-in and check-out times,which was great since I was flying in for a conference.  Also,"he made it clear he was available and usually in the area to help me out if I had any problems but otherwise gave me total privacy.  The apartment has it's own entry and exit to the street which is great. Also the apartment is very close to the Harvard Avenue stop of the Boston College transit line which made it extremely easy and cheap for me to get to my conference each day.  There are also lots of good restaurants and food in safe walking distance.\"",,,

Location is excellent, both for walking around and also getting in and out of Boston or, in our case, Cambridge."
5661246,51170023,2015-10-18,4724293,Wes,Mark's place was perfect for a weekend in Boston. Mark was super helpful with checking in and helping us out and the apartment was great.

Location is great, with nearby restaurants, shopping, grocery stores, and café. (including a delicious Brazilian bakery just minutes away!) The green line is also very close, and the Ubers we took into various parts of the city never cost more than $15."
Mark and Roman were lovely hosts and Mark is very available to answer questions and accommodate requests. I definitely recommend this place to people looking for a good,"affordable option in Boston. \"",,,,
5661246,68360488,2016-04-04,57548247,Victor,"Mark's dad Roman was a very nice Russian man. He shared that he had a friend in Russia that had the same name as me. He was thorough in the description of the place and all that was available to me in the room. The room is underground, which was awesome for me and my girlfriend being from places with no basements or rooms underground. The area was perfect for what i needed. Close to the subway, pizza and bars."

5661246,87078064,2016-07-18,60837681,Michael,"My stay at Mark's studio apartment was just fine.  I was in town visiting my daughter, and just needed a place to sleep and shower.  The place was as described and as shown in the photos.  It is not fancy, but is clean and functional.  It is a studio apt in the basement, half below ground and half above ground.  There were several windows, so there was plenty of daylight.  And the fact that it was part underground made it cool on hot days.  There is a separate entrance from the house, so it is private.  The bathroom is small, with a stand-up shower (no tub), which is all I needed.  There is a refrigerator, microwave, and sink, but no stove.  However, that was fine for me, since I was going out to eat."
This place is only a couple of blocks from the intersection of Harvard and Commonwealth.  So it has great access to the T subway (Green Line - B) and to some main bus lines.  I felt fine walking in the neighborhood.,,,,,
Mark checked in by text several times to make sure everything was OK.  Mark's father Roman let me in.  He is a nice man and was available to let me in even though my flight was delayed and I arrived late.  No key was required,since the door has a push-button lock which Roman programmed with a code unique to me.,,,,
This place was good for my purposes,"and I would stay again if visiting Boston.\"",,,,

The location is perfect, especially if you plan to use public transit when in Boston - so easy and convenient to get anywhere in the city!

There are also a lot of great amenities within a short block or two - restaurants, CVS, an organic grocery store, Dunkin' Donuts - all handy when you're traveling!

The room and the shared bathroom were very clean and welcoming. My first great impression was meeting the very polite and friendly Wellington, a young man from Brazil. He stayed up very late to welcome me to the house. What really put it over the top is the way Andrew went out of his way to make my stay pleasant: offering pick me up from the T stop (I was getting in late, and his offer was very much appreciated), brewing coffee in the morning, and leaving midnight snacking cookies for me when I returned! Andrew is a very together guy his home is a great deal: you simply can't get into the Boston/Cambridge area and be treated this well for less than this.  Thank you Andrew, Wellington, and AirBNB!"

Even though we were only there for a night, Andrew went above and beyond to make sure our stay was pleasant and carefree. This was my first time using AirBNB and I am glad I tried it out after the positive experience I had staying there. The home is beautiful and situated in a part of Boston that is quiet and yet authentically provides a vibrant experience of a charming part of the city that is often hidden from tourists. While not in the city center itself, the house is a convienent walk from the T trolly that connects to the Red Line and an affordable car share distance from the heart of Boston or Cambridge. I highly recommend Andrew's place to anyone who wants to wholistically experience Boston and its hospitality beyond Havard Square or the Freedom Trail."
8133752,51237749,2015-10-18,13742800,Matthew,Andrew made it super easy to get in and was an amazing host. His house is very uniquely decorated and clean. He had fresh pie and coffee for us and was incredibly friendly. Highly recommend staying at his beautiful house!
8133752,84091275,2016-07-05,58764022,Kait,"Staying with Andrew was an absolute treat! His home is lovely, he and his partner were very friendly, and the neighborhood is relaxed but also close enough to shops, restaurants, walking distance from a grocery store, city center, and a great park. Would definitely recommend!"
8133752,91246106,2016-08-04,86863208,Mischa,"Andrew was a very welcoming host and provided everything we needed during our stay. The neighborhood was nice with a grocery store just down the street, and a quick walk to the trolley which connects with the Red line. Andrew's home was very clean, comfortable, and classy. Andrew provided us with great recommendations for attractions in the city. Their dog Lola was a total cutie and loved attention! Would definitely recommend for travelers to Boston."
8133752,92996568,2016-08-11,10043007,ShouYu,"Andrew was a great host, and his place is clean. The location is great, easy to find a dinning place, near grocery stores, and convenient to commute to downtown Boston. I enjoyed my stay in Boston. Thanks, Andrew."
8133752,94366514,2016-08-15,89083884,Betsalel,"We had a wonderful stay here! The hosts were very friendly and kind, and helpful in guiding us to places we were looking for in the neighborhood. There was a very nice selection of eateries and shopping within easy walking distance, from restaurants to necessities. The neighborhood itself was very safe and quiet, and people that we passed by were always friendly. The house itself is a very cute house from the late 1800's that has been as modernized as it could or should be, and the hosts have a very interesting collection of memorabilia from travels to peek at. They offered us a train card to load and take public transport, but we wanted the autonomy of being able to say 'What's that? let's look now!'  Our room was absolutely perfect for us, with closet space, a mini-fridge, a robe, and some towels. There was also bottled water in the mini-fridge. There was no A/C, but the window and ceiling fan did the trick. They were really nice to talk with, and had all needs covered (I didn't bring my own espresso pot as I usually do, but they let us use theirs). We would very gladly stay with them again, and even be proud to call them friends."

2043541,12486689,2014-05-04,2325715,Anne,"Stayed two nights with 5 people so we could walk to an event at the TD Garden.  Location was great if you want to be in the North End.  Jan was very nice, but the phone number on the listing is not hers, and the office doesn't know all the details on these rentals, so I was not entirely confident going in. However, it worked out fine, luggage storage was available, and that worked fine.  However, the unit needs some attention if it wants to meet the standards we've experienced at other Airbnb's.  Things that need attention:  dishes, broken blinds, windows that won't stay open, one tiny kitchen towel, maid service (a greasy broiler pan was still there). The rest was clean enough, though.  The place is classic old Boston, so expect creaky floors, and close living with others around and above you."
Pros: location,sleeps 7,price is ok,love old buildings,free wifi (though inconsistent),comfortable platform beds
Cons: kitchen accessories. 2 toasters,but no mixing/serving spoons,no sink drain cover,not enough dishes to serve 7 people at one time,LR chairs in photo are not there,silverware was tiny
It served our purposes,but a couple hundred dollars would make the place appear much more welcoming and organized,and I think Jan really was very nice,although we never met.  For students,those used to hostels,"etc. this is fine.  I've used Airbnb all over Europe and in much of US.\""
2043541,14179919,2014-06-14,12237332,Scott,This apartment is in the perfect spot to enjoy.  It's in an awesome neighborhood with tons of good restaurants and bakeries.  It's just steps from the freedom trail. And we felt completely at home here after just a couple of hours.  We are a family of five and this apt was comfortable for us.
2043541,18659564,2014-08-30,2177802,Charlotte,This apt was very nice in a perfect location in North End. Getting the keys went very well and the host was very quick to respond to questions etc. we got towels and nice service. Would highly recommend this!
2043541,21121524,2014-10-12,3414455,Katelin,We had a brilliant time in this apartment during our visit to the delightful Boston! Terrific location - don't miss out on Mike's pastry... It is certainly worth the wait! We walked everywhere- the apartment is everything you need. Very comfortable beds and a really comfortable couch! Jan is lovely to deal with - I had a bunch of questions and she was contactable at any time. Thanks for such a wonderful stay!
2043541,22458021,2014-11-07,21723421,Stefanie,I've spent a couple of nights in this appartment with 3 of my colleagues and we enjoyed our stay very much. The appartment was clean and all necessities were present. Very good shower and nice beds. Jan and Seth were very helpfull and easy to reach.
The location was superb,in the middle of Little Italy,with a dozen of very good restaurants and pubs nearby. Public transport can be accessed after a 5-10 minutes walk,but the city centre can be reached by foot easily.,,

2043541,25547741,2015-01-19,15187517,Steven,"We had a great time staying at 16 Battery! The space was just as advertised.  It was close to tons of great restaurants and it was easy to get to anywhere else in Boston from there.  Some of the furniture seemed like it was either hastily put together or close to falling apart, but we didn't mind too much.  Host was quick to answer our questions."
2043541,26135094,2015-02-04,13043951,Ni,"I enjoyed my stay at 16 Battery st. Before my trip, Jan upgraded my apartment to a remodeled unit for free. My parents and I liked it very much. The unit is clean and warm. The location is great! The building is very close to the Old North Church and some phenomenal Italian restaurants. I recommend anyone to stay here when visit Boston."
2043541,31132293,2015-05-02,15274059,Tom,"Communication with Jan and Seth was great and the apartment was exactly as advertised - clean, comfortable and in a great part of town. I would definitely recommend this property."

2043541,31930146,2015-05-12,24782526,Giuseppe,The apartment was comfortable and set in a good location.
2043541,32227443,2015-05-16,5237162,Trina,Best place to live in Boston. The check in and check out process is fuss free and it was so easy to store luggages even after we had to check out. The place was extremely clean and the kitchen was well equipped. Everything worked well and the location was so convenient. We really couldn't have asked for anything better. Being able to live in a historic and safe part of Boston with low prices is a pretty sweet deal.

2043541,36280831,2015-06-27,32313172,Karen,Apt. Was clean and in a great part of town. Able to pick up keys hour earlier than check in so we could drop off bags. Only communicated with host thru email.
Walked to all the sights we wanted to see. Surrounded by lots of fab Italian restaurants! Some noise from apt above but not bad and not late at night.  Able to access wifi would have been great,"but other than that it was wonderful!\"",,,,
2043541,41593096,2015-08-08,30401733,Catherine,L'appartement était comme dans le descriptif et idéalement situé. Nous avons apprécié notre séjour. Et si un jour je dois revenir à Boston sur nous reviendrons ici et je le conseillerai à mes amies. Nous sommes sortis le soir et aucun problème de sécurité. Tout la famille était heureuse de ce séjour. La communication a été très facile car nous n'avions pas les codes Wifi mais dans l'heure qui a suivie nous avons eu les codes. Merci pour la rapidité de réponse.
2043541,42164411,2015-08-11,37342859,Tania,Everything was flawless during arrival and departure (my apologies for not leaving promptly at check-out time).
Location of apartment was really great - the north end is a great spot,and there was easy access to all the sites/activities we had on our priority list.,,,,
For 6 people,the apartment was on the cozy side.,,,,
-The beds were comfortable,1 person in our group slept comfortably on the futon-style sofa in the living room.,,,,
-The kitchen and dining space were adequate,and as described in the listing.,,,,
-The bathroom was definitely tight.  With no photos,we were slightly disappointed with the small stand-in shower and tight space at sink/toilet.  lucky for us,we managed to stagger our showers and use of the toilet,"so we made it work.\"",,
2043541,42416382,2015-08-13,37434022,Julie,Our family of 6 loved our stay in Boston at Battery McPhee.  Very easy to find; fabulous location just a few steps from the Freedom Trail and the top restaurants of Little Italy; immaculately clean and well equipped with very comfortable beds in an extremely safe neighborhood. Loved the details like extra towel bars and night lights.
2043541,43578450,2015-08-20,41211418,Tom,"We stayed here for 3 nights and didn't come across a single problem. The key collection was smooth and simple and they even allowed us to drop bags off early which was a godsend. Rooms were nice and bed was comfy, air con was phenomenal as it was very hot! Would definitely recommend staying here and the location was ideal, as it was close to a metro station and location was safe :)"
2043541,47243247,2015-09-17,29911323,Jonathon,"Wow. Location, location, location. If you want an apartment in the heart of boston, little italy, north end and the waterfront then this is the place. It was amazing. Central to everything."
Key pick up was simple and easy. Apartment was fantastic for family of 5 with 2 bedrooms and 3 beds. AC was great as the weather was warm. Building is secure and safe.,,,,,
I would stay here again and would recommend others to stay here. I have no complaints.,,,,,
"Excellent.\"",,,,,
2043541,47966441,2015-09-22,26605662,Carol,"We picked up our keys and walked around the corner to our apartment. True to photos, small but spacious at the same time and comfortably slept five adults. It's about a 10 minute walk to the subway from the apartment. Cafes and restaurants are a casual walk around the corner."

2043541,49119896,2015-10-01,9599248,Martha Elena,Fue decepcionante llegar a tal sitio
Era la primera vez q reservaba en airbnb y creo no lo volveré a hacer,,,,,
El lugar es un hueco mal oliente y mal teñido,,,,,
La entrada es lo peor q yo haya estado,,,,,
Era un hueco vergonzoso con cinta en las ventanas el techo casi sobre la cabeza las escaleras de ingreso peligrosas y sucias,,,,,
El apto con tubería expuesta por todo el techo,,,,,
Los descodificadores para la Tv no funcionan as eran tirados en el suelo en un solo enredo y no le cabía mas polvo,,,,,
Los tapetes y cojines de la sala de asco,,,,,
Realmente no entiendo como tienen una propiedad de estas características para alquiler,,,,,
No es para nada digno para habitar y menos por el precio q se pago,,,,,
La ubicación es muy buena pero es tan deprimente el lugar q no se justifica,,,,,
"Mi peor experiencia\"",,,,,
2043541,49586872,2015-10-05,31794548,Katelyn,"We really enjoyed our stay at 16 Battery.  The location couldn't have been more central to almost everything. We took our 2 small children and were impressed by the space in the apartment. We were able to cook have separate bedrooms and did I mention space to spread out. We were thankful they dropped off a pack and play for our youngest to have the best sleeping arrangement. Staying close to little Italy was amazing we found several great restaurants. We will stay here again the next time we visit. Nothing negative to say, it was clean and felt cozy!"
2043541,50619206,2015-10-13,13591797,Kathy,The unit (1R) was in a very convenient location around the corner from many fine Italian restaurants. At the other end of Battery St is a lovely Harbourside walk for a different view of Boston. The unit is in an older style building and a little dark but was immaculately clean with everything needed for a stay as a couple or with a family. I would recommend it to those looking for convenience to tourist attractions and hearty Italian fare.
2043541,50785843,2015-10-14,43542342,Al,"Perfect location, virtually on the Freedom Trail and close to restaurants and bars. Parking is very close and easy to find. We had an excellent stay."
2043541,51269909,2015-10-19,8845282,Juan,Everything work very well. Nice location. They were helpful and responsive with every doubt I had.
2043541,52307802,2015-10-28,4225711,Christophe,"Simply put the worst experience with AirBnB. The place was not only basic, it was dirty, the mattress covers were stained and the comforters were stinking. Avoid this place."
2043541,53747255,2015-11-12,43340117,Laura,"We never met the host as they directed us to pick up our keys around the block that were left in a mailbox.  The location where the keys were and distance to the apartment were very close and convenient.  We didn't have any trouble checking in or out.  The location is right in the heart of Little Italy which was a fun experience to be close to a lot of delicious restaurants.  We were also conveniently located near the T which made it easier to navigate around the city.  The apartment was smaller than I expected, however, fit our needs.  We had six guests stay in the three queen beds which worked out well.  There were kitchen utensils to use if needed and closet space to put suitcases in.  Over all - it worked out well for our first Boston experience."
2043541,54861590,2015-11-25,26437417,Steve,Great little apartment fit my wife and I and our 2 teenage boys. Cool location in heart of little italy in the North End. Walking distance to heaps of sites.
2043541,55219678,2015-11-29,24641937,Marito,"We enjoyed staying at this place for 3 nights. We didn't meet the host, but we received emails prior to our trip with detailed description of the apartment. Checking in/out was easy with the key pick up location nearby and easy access to the T station. The apartment was clean and simple with 3 beds and 1 sofa bed. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a convenient and simple place to stay in the heart of North End. Thank you!"
2043541,61025548,2016-01-31,7660270,Martin,Stayed four people for 30 days.
Pro: Good instructions for key pick-up around the corner from the apartment. Apartment with basic utensils.  Never met the host,but fast reply on the email. Great neighborhood. Walkingsdistence to public transport,restaurants,city center,Mass. General Hospital,
Con: No vacuum cleaner,"had to email everytime we needed vacuuming which was insufficiently done. Not cleaned properly at arrival. No daylight in appartment. \"",,,,
2043541,61698315,2016-02-07,3740942,Stephen,"We had a good overall experience staying at 16 Battery.  We did not end up staying in this particular unit - prior to our trip, Jan asked us if we'd like some additional space, so we ended up staying at 2 other units (1G and 4F) for the same price.  As we had a group of 6, we welcomed this change as it gave us a 2nd bathroom and 2 extra bedrooms."
The building is rather old,but the units we stayed in both seemed to be renovated and were in good condition.  They had the basic essentials (linens,towels,kitchenware),so we had everything we needed for our trip.,
Of the places we've stayed in Boston,the North End is definitely our favorite location.  You can't go far without walking into an Italian or Seafood restaurant,and being right near the freedom trail helps you get your history fix.,,,
We would definitely recommend staying here,"and would love to visit again in the future.\"",,,,
2043541,74060205,2016-05-12,8142188,Hiep,This apartment is at very good location in the Northend area and is very close to all the restaurants and shops around there. It is also within a short walking distance to downtown and other attractions as well.

You were an excellent host and there were zero issues with getting set up. Easily my best Airbnb experience. I highly recommend this condo and the host to anyone looking for Boston and not the hotel thing. 5-10 minute walk to Italian food, T's and Anthony's for breakfast. Made our weekend."
7181950,42327665,2015-08-12,32028237,Christine,Very nice situation; nice and comfortable apartment! Only the view on the backyard wasn't pretty... and a little noisy. It would ne nice to have a Boston's map and some tea or coffee when we arrive.

The apartment is excellent, with modern features and a really nice layout. It also has access to the building's rooftop deck which provides really great views of the city and the water. The historic neighborhood is fantastic too - we really enjoyed having so many great North End restaurants and attractions within walking distance."

The apartment was clean and the location could not have been better or easier to get to from the airport. We would highly recommend this location if you are planning a visit to Boston.  As they say in Boston it was wicked good."
7181950,47709522,2015-09-21,8165628,Kathy And Joe,This unit is very conveniently located for sightseeing in Boston's historic Northend.  Great restaurants and the Freedom Trail are steps outside the door. Everything is nicely remodeled with a very comfortable bed and furnishings.  Thanks Jason for providing a great place to stay.
7181950,49002434,2015-09-30,5506661,Binnie,"This was a perfect apartment in a great neighborhood!  It was so convenient and close to restaurants and sites. It was very clean and functional, even the TV had cable and Netflix/Hulu. Jason was a great host who was available for questions and ideas for where to go, places to do.  I will definitely recommend this apt to friends visiting Boston!"
7181950,49467524,2015-10-04,24890004,Al,"Had a great time exploring the north side of the city. The location is perfect. Be prepared to pay for parking if you have a car, since the north district has zero on street parking. If I were to do it again, I'd skip the car rental, since you can get around easily by foot. Again, he location is perfect! Jason is a great host, you will be happy with the accommodations and hospitality."
7181950,50015345,2015-10-08,3501104,Andrew,"I was sent a detailed manual for the apartment well-before arriving which made the process of getting in a breeze!  The apartment is in a fantastic location in the North End, close to everything, and lots of great places to eat very close nearby, not to mention a Starbucks practically across the street; very convenient in the morning if you choose not to use the fully-stocked Keurig.  This place was absolutely impeccable, with great furnishings, spotlessly clean... the sort of amenities you would expect in a very nice hotel room but a LOT more space."
Jason was amazingly helpful and communication was easy.  I can't recommend this place highly enough,"this is exactly what you want from a place to stay and nothing that you don't; perfect!\"",,,,
7181950,50857268,2015-10-15,44033358,Andy,"We loved staying here.  The flat is exactly as described, and provides excellent accommodation for exploring Boston.  The bed is particularly comfortable.  In the North End, it is very convenient for a large number of Italian restaurants, and within easy walking distance of central Boston.  The T stations are really close if you want to travel further afield.  Jason provides a good and detailed set of notes on the flat, and is always ready and willing to help with any advice you need.  He responded really quickly to emails we sent to him both before and during our stay."
7181950,51279782,2015-10-19,18992661,Adrienne,"Fabulous apartment in a great location - just as described and very roomy for 2. Despite initial reservations about being on the ground floor, it made everything so easy!"
Jason was very helpful prior to our arrival with information and so accommodating even to the point of being there to meet us before check in time so we could drop our bags. Appreciated having a generous supply of towels and consumables (e.g. paper towels and body wash) so unlike a hotel!,,,,,
Oh and access to the rooftop - what a great place to relax after a long day with a drink at sundown :),,,,,
"Definitely recommend.\"",,,,,

The electronic locks were nice so that I did not have to keep track of a key or remember to leave it behind. Communication from the host was clear and timely. I have stayed in several other Boston area airbnbs, and this is one of the best overall."
7181950,53076196,2015-11-04,8522753,Monika,Jason was a great host and made sure I was all good to go prior to my arrival and after check-in. The apartment is so clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. It was the perfect place to stay for a quick business trip!

Jason sent us a very nice welcome letter with all of the details about the place as well as suggestions for the surrounding area.

We were able to walk the entire North End and enjoy all the North End has to offer. It is also very close to Faneuil Hall, Chinatown, and endless places to shop. The apartment was very clean and had all you need for a delightful stay."

He seems to be willing to accommodate any reasonable request.  The apartment is beautiful and spotless.  Also very quiet.  The North-End is an experience in itself -- with the Freedom Trail running through it and being able to walk to Boston's best (our opinion) restaurants within 5 minutes.  We look forward to coming back.

I was just in town for a short business trip.  I couldn't stay long, however it's places like Jason's home in North End that is going to be giving local hotels in the area problems.  I would much rather spend my time here then at one of the super high end hotels.  It was just a great all around experience."

The spot has a great rooftop,and small closed in patio. Can sleep 4 pretty easily,and has a fully stocked kitchen. Anything that you might need is right around the corner at a local grocer that has a good stock.,,,
Jason was very responsive and helpful,and the place is meticulously maintained. Pretty much everything in it was recently refreshed and top notch quality.,,,,

Check in was a breeze and he was in contact during our stay in case we needed anything.  The apartment is absolutely beautiful... modern decor and immaculately clean. The bed was very comfortable and it was quiet making it very easy to relax at the end of the day. We would definitely stay here again when we return to Boston!!

Parking was challenging but expected (parked in the lot on Commercial and had no issues - pricey but smooth). LOVED that there was a Starbucks there. Great restaurants and bakeries. Everyone we encountered was super friendly. We loved all the info Jason and his dad provided (you must go to Modern Pastry). Jason was available via text and responded super quick. We had a great stay. thank you.
7181950,87845469,2016-07-22,72019610,Elizabeth,The North End home was in a ideal location  in a quiet neighbor. Walking distance to the Long Wharf. Many options to eat within a few blocks. Apartment was very comfortable and we enjoyed staying there. The roof top patio had great view.  Jason's arrangements to use the apartment were great. We would certainly stay there again when in Boston.
7181950,87953318,2016-07-22,83794962,Dave,"Jason was fast to respond to questions before the visit -- which thanks to his good planning was a breeze, and his guide to staying in Boston  was generous and informative to even a knowledgable locals."
The unit was perfect for cooking a casual dinner (his guide notes where to grab groceries),and its location makes it close to the city and North End fun. It is comfortable,well cooled in the summer,and welcoming. For the adventurous,"don't miss the walk to the building's roof as the shared deck has a beautiful view and sea breezes.\"",

A Krups Coffee Maker with plenty of pods, dishwasher detergent, a few kitchen staples, iron, ironing board, laundry detergent, hair dryer, and shampoo/conditioner/body wash. The apartment was very clean."
We absolutely loved the North End neighborhood. Just one block off of the Freedom Trail,it was always easy to find our way home wherever we ventured in the city.,,,,
Jason was responsive,and worked with us to accommodate an early check-in. The pre-stay materials were thorough and helpful.,,,,
We did find that the pull-out couch lacked support - this would be a better option for a child than an adult.,,,,,

7181950,93695175,2016-08-13,78659086,Carlos,Excellent place in great condition and location. Check in and out was a breeze with a combination lock. Walking distance from just about everything and for things that are farther away the train is a short 10 min walk.
If you're looking to save money by cooking a few meals there then make sure you bring your own groceries or be willing to drive a bit as there are no grocery stores within 2 miles. You can get a few things at pharmacy and other small stores but not a whole lot. You can also have your groceries delivered with peadod.,,,,,

Irv was very response to our messages and made sure we had what we needed to access the room in his apartment. For the purposes of my son and I who were in Boston for just a couple of days to look at Universities it was fine. If you are comfortable in a bachelor pad, this is it. It wasn't clear what towels we could use after showering, there was a computer monitor in the room, but nothing hooked up to it, so no TV (we were fine with our laptop). There was dust in the bathroom and it was obvious the room had been thrown together before we got there. Again, it was acceptable, just be ready for that. We didn't meet Irv in person, which is fine, he was great in communicating and we really appreciated that! The location is great for our purposes - right next to the subway!!"

Mike had great communication with me and I never felt nervous about things being in place. Very clean and comfortable place. I would love to stay again next time I head to Boston."
4553903,22995916,2014-11-19,1023404,Matthew,I would not recommend the unit due to the high noise day and night.  Property is at street level on a major thoroughfare.  24 hours of traffic and construction noise made for no sleep at all and i am a pretty heavy sleeper.  Street lights kept the unit interior bright all night.
"Interior is as described.  Very attractive unit nicely appointed.  No TV.  Wi-fi was not working.  Available workout room which is a big plus for AirBNB places.\"",,,,,

4553903,23185468,2014-11-24,9129187,Jack,This might have been the cleanest airbnb apartment that I have stayed in - I'm pretty sure my group was the first or second party to stay there.
The unit was a good size,in a convenient location,and was quiet.  The Wifi was great (although we were rather confused about how to connect at first).,,,
Our only complaint was that we were a little confused about the sleeping arrangement when we arrived.  The second queen bed is an air mattress that we set up in the living room,and it's not quite described that way in the listing.  However,once we set up the second bed,"we were very happy with the apartment overall.\"",,
4553903,24270487,2014-12-24,23563601,Suzanne,"This was my first experience with airbnb. Frank and his brother Dan were excellent hosts. The unit was impeccably clean and located in a building that was recently renovated, so the bathroom and kitchen were up-to-date. For any inquiries or problems I had they responded very quickly to answer my question or to resolve a problem."
Location-wise the unit is on the edge of the North End and very close to public transit,stores,restaurants,the Freedom Trail and the Boston Garden. It is on one of the heavier trafficked streets,but before I left they installed curtains that darken and muffle street sounds,which was helpful for me because I am a light sleeper.
I'd recommend this unit for anyone who wants a truly urban experience in one of the most coveted neighborhoods in Boston. Frank and Dave were terrific.,,,,,

Ideally situated for all of central Boston, and only 10 mins walk from the TD Garden / centre town. The tube and buses. There are lots of great Italian restaurants/cafes on the doorstep. We were snowed in and our flight cancelled when we stayed and Frank was extremely helpful and we stayed an extra two nights. We will definitely be recommending to friends who want to visit Boston!! Thanks Julie and Joe Salisbury England"
4553903,26127381,2015-02-04,24127836,Joette,"Our total experience - both with Frank Glaser and the apartment we rented from him - was absolutely fabulous! Frank was welcoming and helpful,  and the apartment was just beautiful! The quality of the space was excellent - plus the thoughtful quality of such details as the bedding, towels, etc. was unexpected and appreciated! The location was ideal for our stay in Boston - immediate access to the North End but also in very close proximity to the many landmarks, the harbor and the Garden. And when the winter weather threatened our ability to leave Boston, Frank offered to let us stay in the apartment another night if necessary! With such a gracious host and beautiful property, we look forward to future trips to Boston that will include another reservation on this great space!"
4553903,27258888,2015-03-01,25805047,Monique,"We had a colleague visiting Boston from London for 3 weeks and we couldn't have asked for a better experience! Frank was quick to reply to all my questions and inquires. I felt comfortable asking him last minute questions because he was efficient. The unit is exactly what the pictures show, if not better. Extremely clean, amazing location, utilities and furniture in excellent condition. This was our first time using Airbnb and we will continue to work with Frank for all our Boston hospitality needs. I rate 5 stars because the communication, unit, and the stress free process blew me away."
4553903,27510842,2015-03-06,7669478,Nell,"We had a fabulous 4 days in Frank's lovely apartment! The place was spotless, brilliantly comfortable and toasty warm on our arrival (which was very welcome considering the multiple feet of snow outside). Bed linen and towels were dreamy. Bright cream interior...you feel that if JR from Dallas had a Boston pad, this would be it! :) The shower was strong enough to blow any sleeping cobwebs away...followed by a filter coffee in the apt...or a trot to one of the nearby cafés. The area is lively and quirky during the day and it's so close to everything."
The apt is (currently) opposite a building site (which by it's nature is not a long term issue!) which isn't so pleasing on the eye but it did provide a great marker so we never had trouble finding our way back to the apt :) Frank came straight back to any of our questions...and really I can't think of one reason not to stay here! :)  ps We are a couple in our 30s,"no kids (it may not be the best location for kids as by a busy road but we are not in the best position to comment on that one! For a pair of big kids like us it was just perfect!)\"",,,,
4553903,27638519,2015-03-09,23908185,Carter,The apt was great! We really enjoyed the place and everything was very nice!  Frank was easy to get in touch with beforehand as well. Thanks again.

4553903,28019120,2015-03-16,2930482,Ashley,Great Place! Very clean and fantastic location. Frank was very accommodating and very easy to communicate with. I would highly recommend this place!
4553903,28301914,2015-03-22,25803760,Amber,This was our first time in Boston and Franks apt was perfect. Everything is just as it looks in the pictures. Great location for walking the whole freedom trail and visiting lots of historical sites. There are tons of great restaurants and shopping areas. We were very comfortable and had a great stay.
4553903,28603097,2015-03-27,27005351,Maika,"Estuvimos muy a gusto en el apartamento de Frank. Es muy céntrico, limpio, cómodo y dado lo caro que es Boston tenia un precio muy razonable. Por poner algún inconveniente, el apartamento ganaría mucho con un suelo un poco más cálido y algo más de menaje de cocina, también se oye el trafico bastante."
Recomiendo este alojamiento.,,,,,

4553903,28778496,2015-03-30,10665879,Andrew,Check-in was simple.  The apartment was immaculate.  The location was amazing.  It is a little noisy as it is on a major traffic arterial but it did not diminish our experience a bit.  (Ear plugs solved the noise at night)
4553903,30148706,2015-04-18,4899653,Christopher,Experience was great.. Location is less then 10 min from Logan Airport.  Central to downtown.  Apartment is really nice and right on the main level of the street.  Great location.
4553903,30791101,2015-04-27,6129922,Kenworth,"Great location, central to everything. Frank was helpful and the description was accurate. Would stay again!"
4553903,31202868,2015-05-03,25503446,Richard,"Beautiful, clean apartment in a superb North End location, a short walk across the street to the T.  Frank provided all the comforts of home...linens, towels, soaps/shampoos, kitchen needs, etc.  I would highly recommend this property for anyone visiting the Boston area."
4553903,31514564,2015-05-06,28555589,Mandi,"This is truly an amazing, very comfortable apartment in a fantastic location. My husband and I were extremely pleased with the proximity to restaurants and historic landmarks. From previous reviews we knew there would be traffic noise, but honestly the noise never disturbed either of us, and I'm a light sleeper. We intend to stay here again on future Boston vacations."
4553903,31621465,2015-05-07,21524649,Marcela,The place was as described and in a great location.
4553903,31661209,2015-05-08,2279539,Suzanne,"I had to leave Boston after I arrived at the airport, so I didn't get a chance to utilize the flat. I did however use it to store my bags for an hour. The flat is clean & you couldn't ask for a better location. It's steps to everything in the North End, North Station, Orange, Blue, Green, Red lines & Fanueil Hall, Aquarium & more. Next time I come to Boston, I'll definitely stay here."
4553903,31706161,2015-05-09,880105,Mary Ellen,We enjoyed our stay at this great apartment. The location was key with awesome access to the North End and TD Garden. I really wish we had more time to stay.
Frank was a good host and communicator. We found everything we needed quickly. This apartment was really clean and well cared for and it's actually larger than the pictures depict. Highly recommended!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
4553903,31911503,2015-05-11,11927604,Douglas,"Frank's communication when we first booked the place was very clear, instructive and easy to use. We arrived to a really nice place in a great location with absolutely no hassle. The whole process was very easy and is set up to be very convenient!"
"The only downside was the advert suggested it could host up to 4 people. We tried to contact Frank a few days beforehand to let them know we would be 4 for one evening but did not receive a response. We then discovered the extra room was in fact a blow up air mattress which was not what we were expecting. \"",,,,,
4553903,32107120,2015-05-14,27080430,Mary,Very convenient. Pictures depict accurate portrayal of interior.  Needed help adjusting air conditioning controls. Called owner and he responded very promptly and was very nice about helping.
4553903,32191726,2015-05-15,31996633,Hau,"Franks place was super nice and clean.  The place was larger than we thought and its close to the subway and a shirt walking distance to faneuil hall and the aquarium. Frank was able to accommodate us with our early check in request.  Did not meet him, but I guess we didn't have to!  Great stay and would do it again!"
4553903,33075242,2015-05-25,19319558,Bart,"We had an amazing time staying at Frank's apartment, whilst we didn't actually meet our experience was hassle free and Frank Did touch base with us during our stay."
The apartment is large and comfortable,"clean and in a good location in North End and near Haymarket for the trains. I would recommend staying here.\"",,,,
4553903,33232869,2015-05-26,5819409,Carey,Frank's apartment was absolutely beautiful and located in the heart of the North End. The apartment was clean and my communication with Frank throughout the process was seamless.
4553903,33379733,2015-05-27,10953467,Joe,"Looks just like the pictures. Great location, clean and spacious. Communication was easy and Frank was very accommodating."
4553903,33569471,2015-05-30,19692596,Don,The location was perfect and very convenient to see the sights of Boston. A few minute walk to the T allowed us to visit friends in Cambridge. Will try to book the next time we come to Boston.
4553903,34008039,2015-06-03,5504612,Sarah,"We loved our stay here. We were initially meant to stay in Frank's other apartment but had to change to this one, and it was sorted quickly and easily before we even got there."
The location was great for The Freedom Trail and the apartment is basically in the Italian district,so we had lots of choice for places to eat and go for a drink. It's also really close to Impov Asylum,which we went to on one of our nights.,,,
The apartment was clean,well-kept,"spacious and very comfortable. I'd stay here again.\"",,,
4553903,34212071,2015-06-06,31974689,Angel,Frank's apartment was beautiful! He provided all the essentials and even more. The bed was very comfy and the kitchen was complete. The apartment itself is in an ideal location. Frank also responded quickly when we had questions. It was definitely a good experience!
4553903,34692896,2015-06-11,11577197,John,"Frank's apartment is a spacious, modern and well-appointed loft on the very edge of North End. The bed is comfortable and the apartment contains everything required for a pleasant stay. The only issue is that it is very noisy. Despite the address being in one of the small North End streets, the main entrance is on the multi-lane highway at the entrance/exit of the Logan Tunnel by Haymarket Station. The consequence is the constant noise of traffic and horns, and the occasional emergency vehicle siren, both day and night."
When I selected the apartment,part of the decision was based on the location,which from the flag appeared to be deep in the heart of North End close to the Old North Church. As this is the second time I have made a reservation on the basis of inaccurate information,I have taken up the issue with AirBnB (clearly it is not Frank's fault). They justify their not precisely identifying locations for reasons of confidentiality. However when the location is indicated at some 1000 feet from the correct one,in a densely populated city,this is a pretty poor justification.
I would nevertheless recommend Frank's apartment - it is close to the T (Haymarket) and to North End action,and very comfortable. It would be much improved with proper sound insulation,and in the interim,"would strongly recommend ear-plugs.\"",,
4553903,35295522,2015-06-17,28294235,Heather,There were plenty of basic supplies to use and we appreciated that there was coffee available. The welcome sheet and provided maps to borrow were very helpful. Overall the space was very nice and met the needs we were looking for.
4553903,36002300,2015-06-24,28521794,Linda,"The apartment was wonderful!  It was everything we could have hoped for.  Location was great, close proximity to the Long Wharf and to the Commuter Rail station if you want to go outside of Boston.  You can even get on the Freedom Trail just a few short blocks away!  The size and comfort of the apartment was perfect.  We used the air mattress and it was incredibly comfortable.  My mother (age 77) and I spend a week here visiting and we were always happy to come back, usually stopping at Bova's Bakery on the way home :-)  I hope to come back to Boston some time in the future and this will be the first place I'll check to book my next stay."
4553903,36107097,2015-06-25,18588075,Aurore,Très bel appartement qui correspond aux images publiées dans l'annonce. L'hôte a était à notre disposition et facilement joignable. Horaire du Check in flexible. Je recommande cet appartement.
4553903,36375313,2015-06-28,14980834,Therese,"Our family of 4 found Frank's apartment to be spacious, classy and comfortable. Great location to hang out in the North End or hop on the T at Haymarket. Busy street but the unit is quiet. The air bed in the living room turned out to be fine for our teen sons. They didn't seem to mind the light coming in through the transom but other guests may find an eye mask helpful."
4553903,36612774,2015-06-29,4831584,Benjamin,"Franklin's place was beautiful. It was very clean and comfortable. The location of this apartment is perfect.

4553903,36952465,2015-07-03,19956276,Jf,"Had a great time at this apartment. The location is incredibly convenient : we parked our car near by (74$ for 2 nights - we took the closest one and did not shop around) then we did everything we wanted to do on foot and by subway (we walk s around the North End, walked to the aquarium and explored some nice neighbourhoods close by.) The apartment was nice and very clean. The only downside is that it is a bit noisy as it is close to a some major roads."
"The host was very responsive and did everything he could to ensure we had a good stay. \"",,,,,
4553903,37377360,2015-07-06,36280315,Brandon,"We had a lovely time staying here. The condo was very clean, nice and comfortable. And what an AMAZING LOCATION. We toured all the historical sights and were always a 15 minute walk away from the condo. I couldn't have selected a better spot for our stay!"
4553903,37774175,2015-07-10,918116,Francis,The apartment was very nice and a convenient location. We had expected a quiet location but it is actually on a busy street. In our opinion it is better suited for only two people unless the other two don´t mind the street noice in the living room. Had some trouble with the air conditioner in the beginning but that was later resolved.  Over all we had a great stay and loved being able to walk everywhere. The apartment is very comfortable and nicely furnished. Franklin did respond to us in a timely manner.
4553903,37900118,2015-07-11,17672067,Stephanie,"Beautiful appartment, excellent location, really good size all mod cons. Great experience over all, advice anyone looking for accommodation to stay here."
4553903,38284217,2015-07-14,19119910,Philippa,"This is a great Place to stay in the North end of boston, it was like a 5-6  minute walk to Faneuil Hall and 8 minutes to the Aquarium.  We were in Boston for a concert at TD garden and it was only 3-4  minutes away. There is a T stop across the street and the place was immaculate and spacious.  The bed was super comfy and it is a great place to stay.  it was surprisingly quiet considering how close to a busy road it was.  Franklin got back to us quickly when we had questions and we look forward to staying here again in the future. Accommodation is exactly as pictured and was far nicer than several hotels we have stayed at in Boston, a lot more space and convenient."
4553903,38465760,2015-07-15,38236688,Deb,Great place. Comfy bed! Like brand new. Enjoyed our stay immensely!
4553903,38884023,2015-07-19,36391301,Brad,"This place is near perfect for those that want an authentic experience in Boston. FANTASTIC location within walking distance of everything you'd want to see in Boston--Freedom Trail, Bunker Hill, Boston Common...everything.  You likely will not need a car if you stay here.  Minutes away from Logan airport, you won't pay much for a cab, either. The loft is exactly as you see in the pictures and even includes a washer/dryer. The owner left great directions to nearly amenities and was incredibly responsive during the reservation process.  The only (slightly) negative is that the loft is on a loud street--if you're going to use the front living room as sleeping quarters, just be advised. It's not a deal breaker at all...Would recommend this location to anyone and would definitely come back again."
4553903,39089806,2015-07-20,36821162,Christina,Great place to stay! It had everything we needed. Would love to come back whenever I need a place to stay in Boston!
4553903,39502177,2015-07-24,34592354,Mary,"Great local if you'll be staying in Boston and don't want to deal with having a car. We were traveling with a 10 & 12 year old and we walked everywhere with no problem - Science Museum, Aquarium, Boston Commons, Freedom Trail, etc. And of course, you are just footsteps to some of the best Italian dining and bakeries in the Northeast!"
The apartment was very comfortable and roomy for the 4 of us. Surprise bonus was the in-apartment laundry!,,,,,
Next time we're in Boston,"we know exactly where we'll be staying - Franklins!\"",,,,

The apartment is nice for a family of four and walking distance from restaurants and Fanuel hall market place.  We did not get a chance to meet our host but he communicated via msgs on airbnb. Essentially you pay for the apartment and the nice location."

"Would definitely stay here again.\"",,,,,
4553903,46848606,2015-09-13,12519166,Adrian,"I requested to book the apartment for that night at 5pm. Franklin responded immediately with a pre-approval to make my booking the easiest it's ever been! The place was spotless, 2 blocks from the best of little Italy, hotel height sinks (shout out to girls that understand), a big tub, and most importantly... that. bed. The Tempur-Pedic bed was so comfortable that I skipped some of my sightseeing just to enjoy an extra hour : ) I also loved that I could do a quick load of laundry so I had fresh clothes to go home with! I will be booking again!"

The loft was even better in person than the pictures.  It is a peaceful oasis right in the heart of the city.  It was very nicely decorated with updated appliances,super clean,and had everything we could need.  I even took a picture of the flooring as a possible update idea for our home.  We also enjoyed the convenience of the washer and dryer.  The bedroom is away from the street,so outside noise did not impact our sleep at all.,,
The location was perfect for us,with easy access to the Freedom Trail.  In one day of walking we were able to take in so many of the historical sites. It was also an easy walk to MANY great Italian restaurants and bakeries.,,,,
We loved immersing ourselves in the culture and history of Boston,"and Franklin's loft was the perfect home base.\"",,,,

4553903,48884787,2015-09-29,40192248,Tiffany,Frank was a great host! Quick to answer questions and no hitch in the process of booking. The place was nice and clean just like the photos. The location is great. It's walking distance to attractions and great restaurants.
4553903,49203013,2015-10-02,31516064,Nigel,Frank's beautiful loft appartment was the perfect base for our brief stay in Boston. The North End of the City is full of character with many great places to eat and relax.
The appartment itself was modern,well equipped,stylishly furnished and immaculately clean. Our stay went without a hitch from the moment we arrived at the front door. Frank's helpful instructions and emails both before and during our stay ensured that we felt well supported without any unnecessary intrusion.,,,

Easy to walk to Charlestown or the Common, and a quick jaunt to Cambridge too."
The apartment itself was larger than I expected,with a large bedroom and still plenty of room to inflate an air mattress in the living room. The kitchen had the stuff we needed and the Wi-Fi was fast enough to download 12 episodes of the Mindy Project lightening fast.,,,,
Our host responded to a couple of quick questions within minutes and was kind and welcoming.,,,,,
In short,"everything you could want for a great trip to the best city in America. \"",,,,
4553903,50045155,2015-10-08,22048859,Nathan,This was a great place to stay in Boston. My wife and I only had the opportunity to stay one night at the loft but we really enjoyed our stay for that night. The place is well kept and very comfortable.
4553903,50623000,2015-10-13,13915032,Catherine,"We had a really enjoyable stay at our apartment - it was ideal in every way. Franklin contacted us well ahead of time and was very friendly and helpful. He responded quickly and consistently when we were communicating which was great as we were moving around on the road a lot. The apartment was very spacious and well fitted out, we were very comfortable and as we enjoy cooking, made the most of the kitchen which has a full stove,  oven and microwave. The washer and dryer is a gem to have and both are new and quiet. The location is excellent, very central to all sights likely to be of interest as a tourist. Being able to walk to the beautiful fresh food markets a short distance away, and from the doorstep to the amazing array of Italian delis and restaurants right behind the apartment was fabulous. Coming from Australia we thought a ' loft' meant upstairs with a sloping roof - we were delighted to find it was a street level apartment with high ceilings and a feeling of space. It is worth noting that North Washington is a busy road and there is some street noise. We were a little concerned at first but I can honestly say it wasn't an issue in the end. After all this is inner city living and the location is wonderful - there will inevitable be a small tradeoff for being right in the city.  Be aware if you drive into Boston there is no parking available for your car ( we know about this so no problems)"
4553903,50928213,2015-10-16,41136521,Linda,We had a very comfortable stay in Franklin's apartment. It was exactly as depicted in the photos with modern decor and high end furnishings. It was very clean and a full kitchen if you wish to cook.  Considering it is on a busy road it was reasonably quiet with the bedroom situated furtherest away from the road.
If you don't have a car it is very convenient to the subway - an easy 2-3 min walk. If Italian food is your thing you will find an abundance of restaurants just around the corner.,,,,,
We didn't meet Franklin in person but instructions to get the key were very easy and the one time I had a question Franklin replied immediately.,,,,,
"We felt very safe walking around the area and would definitely recommend this apartment for a couple looking for a central place to stay in Boston. \"",,,,,
4553903,51280549,2015-10-19,19771533,Sophie,"Fantastic flat in a great part of Boston. Contact with Franklin was very easy and really organised from start to finish. The flat is a really good size for the location. It is on quite a busy road but given the bedroom is at the back and how well insulated the flat is, you can't here the road while sleeping. The North End is a buzzing area with lots of great cafes and restaurants. You are also only a stones throw away from Boston Common and close to metro/bike rental if want to explore further. Highly recommend this flat!"
4553903,51612093,2015-10-22,40940466,Jim,"Just returned from a week long trip down the east coast, and Franklin's was our first stop. Very comfy and accessible layout, perfect for our needs. Really close to Haymarket T stop for quick and efficient metro travel. Enjoyed very much the North Side location, giving us walking access to all the shopping and eats the area provided."
4553903,51801435,2015-10-24,46229171,Ryan,"Great place to stay in the North End. A friend and I were in town to visit and take in a hockey game, and Franklin's flat was a great place to stay, easily within walking distance to the arena. The flat was nicely furnished, clean, and overall a great place to stay."
4553903,52228543,2015-10-27,43630018,Erin,We stayed 4 nights at Frank's place a loved it! The location is perfect for visiting Boston. It's steps from the Freedom Trial. The kitchen is well-equiped so feel free to cool a few dinners there and save some money :)
I would highly recommend staying here and would stay here again if I ever find myself in Boston again. Thanks,"Frank!\"",,,,
4553903,52354465,2015-10-28,8943944,Patrick,"The apartment is very close to all the attractions in the North End and had great accommodations. Despite being on a major street there was zero noise in the apartment. We parked nearby overnight for $30, which was fine for us but for multiple days would get pricey. Overall it was great!"
4553903,52449855,2015-10-29,8843919,Larry,"Franklin's place is terrific.  Great location, clean, and easy to access.  A block from the TD Garden.  Will definitely stay here again."
4553903,52684340,2015-11-01,41672367,Vandra,"We had a lovely stay at this apartment. The location was very convenient, it was a few miles from Boston Logan airport and steps away from many restaurants in the North End. The apartment was located in front of a busy street, but it did not disturb us since the bedroom was in the back. There was also central heating/air so that was helpful when it was freezing outside. It was easy to locate and simple to gain access. We did not meet directly with Frank, but he was in close contact with us. Thank you so much!"
4553903,53032954,2015-11-03,2812223,Salil,"Frank was very responsive. The location is great, very close to all the good spots in Boston's North End. The place itself was in great shape. I enjoyed my stay."
4553903,53825549,2015-11-13,16438123,Bradley,Franklin was very welcoming and proactive with information on  how to access the unit.   The apartment was well appointed and the bed was very comfortable.
4553903,55008410,2015-11-27,45462782,Kara,We can't say enough about our stay at the Luxury Loft. It is in the perfect location in Boston. Once we got there we parked the car in a lot two blocks behind the building and walked everywhere else we wanted to go in the city. We were new to the area and Franklin responded to our questions immediately every time. The loft was modern and had every amenity you could need for your stay. We can't wait to make another trip so we can visit the loft again.
4553903,55254833,2015-11-29,47277689,Shuyao,Love this luxury apartment! It is very clean and comfortable. Franklin is very welcoming and always available for help. My friend and I had a good time there!
4553903,55551027,2015-12-01,43435843,Reginald,It's was great!! Smooth check in great location loved the space
4553903,56216200,2015-12-10,44619846,Alok,"Franklin's got a great apartment. It is perfectly located to Hanover St & the T. Modern, with great amenities. Would definitely consider staying there again."
4553903,56287341,2015-12-11,24748300,James,Easy to book and great spot and location! Easy to get key and get into the unit.
4553903,57810492,2015-12-29,27429829,Jason,"We had a wonderful stay! The apartment looks exactly the same as what show on the pictures, neat decoration and clean condition. The location of the apartment is great!! The host is responsible and friendly and replies my message very fast. Great experience!"
4553903,58090987,2015-12-31,52042445,Nick,"Franklin was very responsive in the reservation process and the entire stay went smoothly.  He provided contact number in case we needed anything during our stay.  The modern apartment was very clean and comfortable.  It can be a bit noisy during the day because it is on a busy street, but relatively quiet after rush hour traffic."
4553903,58834499,2016-01-05,10894168,Kate,"Franklin was welcoming and communicative before the trip and during.  The description was just as listed/pictured.  Simple clear check in.  The apartment is a beautiful walk-up, very clean, modern, with a washer/dryer and hairdryer."
"Wonderful location for us -- walkable to everything we enjoyed in North End from coffee cafes to restaurants to Mike's Pastry!  \"",,,,,
4553903,59245743,2016-01-08,10161813,Nguyen,"Another great stay.  Easy key exchange process makes it great for business travelers like myself.  Tons of food options in the North End.  TD Center is a few blocks away. Great location, great flat in general."
It was 8 degrees when I arrived,so the baseboard heat in this unit was struggling to keep up,so my first night was a little chilly,but it was fine the next two nights when evening temps were in the 20s and 30s.  Just something to consider when renting the place.,,
"\"",,,,,
4553903,60218294,2016-01-20,32474175,Mk,This place is one of the best apartment I have ever been.
Very clean,and the mattress was very comfortable.,,,,
The location was great as well.,,,,,
"I would more than love to stay in here when I go back to Boston.\"",,,,,
4553903,60613086,2016-01-25,6245015,Jeremy,"The apartment description was accurate. It was quite clean (though not absolutely spotless), had high-quality appliances and furnishings and thoughtful provision of odds-and-ends in the kitchen and bathroom. Franklin provided instructions and information promptly through messages on the site. The apartment is in a good location, right next to the cafes, bars, restaurants, and shops in North End, and also within easy walking distance to the West End/Beacon Hill (including a nice Whole Foods and wine shop on Cambridge St.) and the waterfront. It's on street level right next to a busy intersection of several roads, so it's easy to get in and out of but there's zero privacy if you open the curtains and there's constant soft traffic noise audible from the living room, though inaudible from the bedroom."
Some trivial negative points: It could use some more and slightly nicer pots and pans and kitchen utensils,though the ones there did the trick. All the clocks were either broken or had the wrong time (I just relied on my phone like everyone does). Some of the light bulbs need replacing,"though the ones that worked provided plenty of light.\"",,,
4553903,60848487,2016-01-28,39812502,Rachel,"Franklin was very welcoming.  For my first air bnb this was so simple.  The location was fantastic.  The place was well stocked, private and perfect."
"Thank you for your hospitality!\"",,,,,
4553903,61309659,2016-02-02,53948684,Angela,"\"Great Stay. This was our first trip to Boston, so we did not know what to expect. But friends recommended we stay on the North End. We found Franklin's listing and booked. He helped us with questions from the time we booked through our arrival. The place was clean and comfortable and felt very safe. We loved Boston, and having this place to \"\"come home to\"\" added to our positive experience. \""
4553903,62165613,2016-02-12,24702789,Yiling,it's a lovely home and host take care of what we need very much!I am glad I made the choice to this great apartment!
4553903,63401398,2016-02-22,26244277,Charlie,The apartment was beautiful and much more spacious than we anticipated. Great location within walking distance of many different attractions. Bed was very comfortable.
4553903,64367822,2016-03-03,4074953,Nora,"The neighborhood was amazing, great restaurants, coffee shops and walk able to all attractions.   Directions were clear and accurate, the property manager was accommodating and easy to work with.  The apartment is on a busy street but the bedroom is situated far from the road and we slept really well!  I would rent this apartment again and loved Boston, the friendly people and amazing history."
4553903,64558139,2016-03-05,39851958,Latoya,My first time experience with Air Bnb and It was simply amazing!
Franklin was a great host of whom even tho we never met,he made himself accessible to me via email!,,,,
That plus the special Little things such as my welcome book and a personal message addressed to me made it that much more special.,,,,,
People told me that the places never look the way they do in the picture,they were right...,,,,
IT WAS MUCH BETTER!!,,,,,
Anytime I'm in Boston,Franklins home will be my first stop when looking for accommodations. I can only pray that he won't be too overwhelmed with reservations and will have an opening for me but,as cute and charming as his place was,I won't hold my breath!,,
"\"",,,,,
4553903,65549661,2016-03-15,56558376,Anthony,"This is my first time using Airbnb and it was a pleasurable experience. The unit is located on a busy street that is easily accessible to various transportation. More importantly, the neighborhood is quite populated and we never feel unsafe when walking through it at night. Franklin really tried to make us feel like we are at home as it was well equipped with everyday necessities and all the little things that we have at home. He also composed a list of things to do in Boston according to our needs! Furthermore, the unit is very very clean and the pictures of the unit on Airbnb are accurate representations. Thanks Franklin for this wonderful experience!"
4553903,65995073,2016-03-18,23311449,Carson,This was our first experience with Airbnb and it couldn't have been better!  The place was very clean and in the perfect location to explore the city!  I would definitely come back to this place when visiting Boston again.

The neighborhood is very cool and it was fun to walk around and check out the architecture.  We will definitely stay here again if it's available next time we're in this part of the city.
4553903,67204939,2016-03-27,26470858,Nam,"Location, location, location! It was our first time in Boston, and we are so thankful that we chose to make this apartment our base for the trip."
The location is steps away from the picturesque North End with its numerous restaurants and shops. It is also conveniently located a block away from the T.,,,,,
The apartment was clean and spacious,and the Kitchen was fully equipped. All in all,"great place and we would happily use again if we ever come back to Boston.\"",,,

No dudéis en reservar, no encontraréis nada mejor por la zona al precio de este apartamento."
4553903,72546341,2016-05-03,61370953,Michael,"Franklin was just great to work with.  He answered any questions we had very promptly and with highly accurate information. He is very friendly and really concerned that you will have a good experience in Boston. The unit is pretty close to the presentation . It is easy to access and was clean and homey. Furniture was very comfortable. The bed is just great .We would definitely stay here over a hotel when we return to Boston.  The location is just fantastic. Easy access to many nice areas and locations. Great restaurants in easy walking distance. Transportation to anywhere is in a short walk. Traffic is a bit noisy, but not bothersome. It is quiet in the bedroom. I am from Chicago and just consider the traffic as part of the big city experience. I would like to thank Franklin again for all his help and the use of a great place. I encourage anyone to rent this unit and not be disappointed."

It's also located in the North End neighborhood which has so many unique restaurants and bars nearby. I've never discovered this part of the city. It's truly a hidden gem.
4553903,76194501,2016-05-25,2054912,Lin,Fantastic location! The apartment is 8-minutes from the airport and right off the Green next to all of North End's popular places like Mike's and Regina's. We walked downtown and to the Boston Commons. Definitely would stay there again.
"Minor note: the kitchen is stocked with the bare basics so plan on eating out.\"",,,,,
4553903,76506479,2016-05-27,4099387,Rachel,"Franklin's lovely apartment was the perfect HQ for a whirlwind visit to Boston. It is as pristine as advertised, and very convenient for weary travelers arriving from Logan Airport!

He was extremely responsive throughout, and a gracious host, even though we were not able to meet in person. Thank you!"

The condo was spacious, clean, and exactly as described and shown in pictures. Located in the bustling North End, we were close to great Italian food and pastries, and not more than a 5 minute walk to the T. We couldn't have asked for a better location or experience! We would definitely stay again!!"
4553903,77964064,2016-06-04,66477162,Heidi,"We had a fantastic experience in Boston!  The place was wonderful - spacious and clean.

4553903,78866809,2016-06-09,24347716,Christina,"My stay at Franklin's lovely apartment was in a word, AWESOME.  He was very helpful prior to arrival with communications.  Upon arrival, all was as described and more.  A small chalkboard message welcomed me into a well appointed, spotless, comfortable apartment conveniently located to all the North End of Boston has to offer."
4553903,79273074,2016-06-12,8595252,Sylvia,"This was our (my husband and I) first trip to Boston and we are so glad we stayed at Franklin's place. Couldn't ask for a better location - everything was within walking distance. The apartment was renovated, spacious and clean. The main bed was very big and super comfortable. Even the inflatable bed was very comfortable. We did not meet Franklin in person, but he was always available/quick to answer via text and made everything very easy.

Thanks for a great stay."
4553903,80745480,2016-06-19,37623020,Jennifer,"The apartment was a nice size and a fairly good location - a little noisy as it is street level in a busy location. The air conditioning was not working properly and could not be fixed during our stay therefore we were uncomfortable. Franklin stated that he would like to host us again if we were in Boston, but that is unlikely and I probably wouldn't choose this location again."

4553903,82770376,2016-06-29,32450380,Yvonne,"On our first visit to Boston, we were very pleased with the location in the North End and the Freedom Trail. The apartment was clean, spacious and comfortable and a safe neighborhood to explore the many restaurants and cafes.  We left for Newport to attend a wedding. When we got there we realized that we forgot the mother of the bride dresses so we frantically called Anya about the situation.  Luckily, a nephew was visiting in Boston and he was able to retrieve the dresses from Anya before he left to meet us in Newport.  Cheers to Anya.  We know she had to make adjustments to her schedule in retrieving the dresses for us when the apartment was occupied.  The wedding would not have been as great without her help.  Thanks so much."

"I would stay again.\"",,,,,
4553903,85526567,2016-07-11,72915658,Brenda,"The apartment is spacious, clean, comfortable and fully equipped. It's in a great, lively neighbourhood brimming with restaurants, bars, cafes and renowned pizza and pastry shops.  Fresh food markets are handy, as well.  The location is great for walking.  The Quincy Market, Freedom Trail and downtown are all very close.  If you like walking like we do, you can even walk to Fenway and Harvard.  The apartment is on a busy street, however, so if you are a light sleeper the traffic noise might be problematic."

Loved walking out and being so close to all the great restaurants in the north end as well as the tours that come out of the harbor. Took the biking tour of the city w adventours down the street- a highlight of the trip. The apartment was perfect for my son and I and our annual guys trip. Clean , quiet, and spacious.

4553903,90964621,2016-08-03,14693601,Amy,We had a wonderful stay here. Location was perfect for us foodies. Close to all sorts of great restaurants and food stops. Our favorites is to wait for Regina's Pizza while having drinks at Ward 8 after a long fun day. Both places are just a few blocks from the loft. Plus the T is across the street so we were able go check out other neighborhoods too. North station is also within walking distance so we were able to take commuter line into town and skip the issue of where to park. (We parked at a friend's house a few towns away and go to meet up with her too!) Can't wait to come back again next time!
4553903,91351220,2016-08-05,3132322,Lana,"My husband and I stayed in this loft for two nights in August 2016. I chose it because of it's great reviews and location. I never met Franklin, but he was quick to respond to messages/questions via Airbnb Messaging and provided us with a comprehensive list of things to do/eat/see during our stay."
Best things about this loft:,,,,,
Extremely clean,,,,,
Convenient location (less than 10 minute drive to Logan Airport and a short walk from a lot of good restaurants,Italian bakeries,points of interest,etc),,
Good wifi signal,,,,,
May want to consider:,,,,,
Really loud. I lived in Manhattan for 3 years and this place reminded me of that time. There is a major construction site across the street (with workers who start very early),tons of cars honking,and random pedestrians arguing outside at all hours of the night.,,,
"Very little natural light. There are no windows in the bedroom or the bathroom. Only large \"\"store front windows\"\" in the living room area that open up to the very busy/loud street so we kept them closed the whole time.",,,,,
Overall,"I think this would a good place for short stays (one or two nights) but I don't think we could have stayed for longer than that because of the noise. \"",,,,
4553903,91890618,2016-08-07,14491135,Mayrel,"Good location, a bit noisy with the construction near by and the traffic but the unit was very spacious, well maintained and cozy."

4553903,92695272,2016-08-09,84989870,Anwar Hussain,A spacious cosy apartment at a very convenient location. We neither experienced any problems with facilities nor noticed any noise - probably  construction work noise has been controlled  or we were very tired to notice.
4553903,94935406,2016-08-17,27322844,Steve,"The apartment is in the perfect location.  The North End is so cool, and this place is in the  heart of Little Italy.  Many shops and restaurants are just a short 5-7 min. walk away.  We could also walk easily to other areas of town, from our loft, as well.  The owner left us a notebook  with lots of information about the apartment and recommendations for Boston.  It was very clean and easy to check in and out, using the box lock on the railing, outside the front door.  There was quite a bit of traffic, on the main street, outside the front door, where we heard quite a few sirens during the night.  However, the bedroom is in the far back of the apartment, so that helped.  Aside from the noise, the apartment and the location definitely out weighed the noise outside. If you want to stay in a lively area, there is going to be a bit of noise.  This place is as close as you can get to many, many restaurants, without being on the main drag.  We will definitely stay here again, when we come back to visit."
6106955,37245112,2015-07-05,22305141,Carli,"The listing/pictures were very accurate. Cara was extremely accommodating and even left an extra high chair and stroller for us to use. The apartment isn't right in Boston, but we actually preferred that because it's a nice and quiet neighborhood. The location was very close to the train and there are several walkable parks if you're traveling with kids."
6106955,39339754,2015-07-22,21152464,James,"Cara's place was perfect and exactly what we were looking for. The outdoor space was incredible! Two porches. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. She left a nice list of suggestions and provided a guide for us to use. She even left us a pass to get into the aquarium for free. The franklin park zoo is a 10 minute walk from the apartment. There is also a very adorable, friendly, playful cat. We really enjoyed his company. We had such a great time we asked to extend our stay by one more day and were so thrilled when she said it was available. Couldn't recommend Cara's  place more!"
6106955,40005481,2015-07-27,1881087,Jean-Yves,"We loved our weekend at Cara's place. It's really well located, next to a metro and to a big park, in a very calm neighbourhood. Cara had prepared everything for us with plenty of details of what to do in Boston. We felt at home right away. And Kitaroo, their cat, adopted us at first sight too :)"
"We'll definitely recommend Cara's listing to friends and book again if we come back to Boston (which we will because there is so much to see!).\"",,,,,
6106955,50335861,2015-10-11,42724198,Germaine,"I feel like we stumbled upon a jewel!  The apartment is nestled into one of Boston's charming neighborhoods with a wonderful park system steps from the door, and the T station just a five minute walk. The apartment was comfortable, cozy and clean. And the cherry on top:  their wonderful kitty!  I would definitely stay again!"
6106955,60046534,2016-01-18,52825187,Cavanagh,It was our pleasure to have stayed at the home of Cara and family. The condo was just as described - possibly even better than described. It was such a peaceful environment with a cozy and inviting setting and a wonderful view into the woods of Franklin Park.
Cara was quite communicative and helpful throughout the whole process.,,,,,
"When we need a place to stay near our daughter again I hope the \"\"treetop condo\"\" will be available - it was a delight!\"",,,,,
6106955,88035287,2016-07-23,72522679,Mariana,Cara  is kind and positive.  Her apartment is cozy and pleasant. I really enjoyed my stay and highly recommend  everyone to be her guests. The pictures of the apartment are accurate and everything was as described in the announcement. The neighborhood is very interesting and the metro is very close. Canto 6 Bakery worth the visit.
6106955,89733534,2016-07-29,58243165,Lilian,"This charming condo was everything and more! A beautiful home, with plenty of space for all of us. I loved the decor, and the location was fantastic. Street parking was easy to find, the T was just a short walk away. Next time I hope we get the chance to explore Franklin Park, which was just mere steps away. Cara and her family thought of everything, and our daughter loved the hammock in particular. So many thanks to Cara and her family for making our trip so memorable!"
6106955,92749600,2016-08-09,68873701,Birgit,"Cara has a wonderful home and we enjoyed staying there very much. With the entrance of Franklin Park at the doorstep, the kids enjoyed exploring the environment and street parking was easy to find. The T-line is just a short walk away. So many thanks to Cara and her family for making our trip so memorable!"
6644330,43867388,2015-08-22,8104627,Thore,Excellent host and accommodation!  The room was nice and clean with a fair price.  Jason is very helpful and friendly.  I will ask him again next time I come to JP.
6644330,47162125,2015-09-16,39427460,Sonia,Jason was a very welcoming and friendly host and offered to collect me from the airport. On arrival Jason left me a welcome card and candy which was a lovely touch! The condo was very clean and I had access to all amenities. My room was very comfortable and clean and the decking/ garden area was perfect for relaxing and reading. I very much enjoyed my stay here and would definitely come again!
6644330,47306861,2015-09-17,43499018,Nick,Jason is an extremely welcoming and accommodating host. It was a delight to meet such a nice person and to spend a week in his apartment that was exceptionally clean and tidy and had everything we required.
"We were made to feel completely at home. I would definitely recommend Jason and his apartment for anyone wanting to stay in the Jamaica Plain area of Boston\"",,,,,
6644330,76607033,2016-05-28,45490752,Samantha,I lived at Jason's for three months as a travel nurse. Very easy commute by bus (20-25 mins door to door) to Childrens as well as other hospitals in the Longwood Medical area. The apartment is also a five minute walk to the Orange Line train station that gets you all over the city.
Jason is easy to communicate with and will accommodate to any need. He was extremely respectful of my crazy sleep schedule and made sure I always felt at home. When I had out of town visitors,Jason was welcoming and made sure they had everything they needed. Jason's dog,Cairo,is very friendly and low maintenance (and so cute!),,
As far the apartment itself,Jason keeps it clean and comfortable. The room and bathroom had everything I needed since I didn't come with furniture. The washer was temporarily out of service and Jason paid for drop off/ folding laundry service.,,,,
Jamaica Plains is charming and quiet,which was a nice break from the hectic city. The apartment is a five minute walk away from lots of tastey restaurants and unique shops on Centre street. The pond and arboretum are good places for running/ walking/ just being outside.,,,,
I would recommend staying at Jason's to anyone visiting Boston for short or long periods of time. Thanks again Jason!,,,,,

6644330,98302484,2016-08-30,83822297,Kelly,"I can't imagine what else Jaaon could have done to make me feel welcomed and accepted. He even did FaceTime with me when I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong with the lockbox, though he had sent me an excellent video demo."
13830152,94587643,2016-08-16,82370501,Krissy,The room was exactly as advertised. Gaining access was easy. It was one of the hottest weekends in Boston and we were happy to see the window unit. The bedding was clean and new and the full size bed was very comfortable.
The shared bathroom was clean and it wasn't too much trouble to share with the other couple in the second room. Bring your own washcloth as the towels are provided but washcloths are not.,,,,,
"We will book again when needing a place in Boston. \"",,,,,

The location itself was very nice,clean and spacious. There was breakfast and coffee provided in the kitchen,which was very nice!,,,
Only downside was the aircon which was a bit loud,but there were earplugs provided.,,,,
Jurek was there in the morning,he was very nice and communication was nice and easy!,,,,
"All in all I would totally recommend staying here - there was nothing to complain about.\"",,,,,
13830152,99037185,2016-09-03,85393882,Hao,"Jurek is a very kind person! Room is clean and beautiful, we really enjoyed a good time."

A deux pas du métro, tout près de Main Street (Charlestown), facile d'accès depuis l'autoroute et stationnement facile. Appartement complet et assez spatieux.

The apartment is freshly renovated and has everything someone could dream about.,,,,,
I enjoyed my stay from start to finish and I have absolutely nothing to complain about.,,,,,
"I would definitely come again.\"",,,,,
9575439,73535082,2016-05-08,67267444,Mary,"Maria's place was great. It has just been renovated, and was nice and spacious. Maria greeted us warmly, and visited with us several times. We were made to feel right at home. The bed was very comfortable, and she even had dust mite covers on both the pillows and mattress. This was a nice touch for me as I have allergies. Ray enjoyed the coffee. Parking is on the street, but we were always able to find a space. The neighborhood is fine and close to the T. Will will stay with her again if our daughter stays in the area."
9575439,78970983,2016-06-10,46865053,Bárbara,"Essa foi minha primeira experiência no Airbnb. Desde o momento da reserva, Maria se preocupou em ajudar com informações e minha chegada na casa foi muito tranquila. O lugar é exatamente como descrito: completamente renovado, lindo e aconchegante. Maria é uma anfitriã atenciosa e sempre por perto quando precisamos de alguma ajuda. JP é um bairro com várias opções de bares, restaurantes e mercados, e seus moradores são extremamente amigáveis. A casa fica a 5 minutos de caminhada da Orange Line. Estou muito feliz de ter encontrado esse lugar para minha temporada em Boston!"
9575439,86427214,2016-07-16,8989220,Hailey,"Staying with Maria was comfortable, clean, safe and easy. Great communication the whole time. The house is lovely and has everything you could need."
9575439,91469961,2016-08-05,29510451,Rekha,"I was perfectly happy staying in Maria's house: it was cosy, spacious, very tidy and clean. Maria was very kind, and our communication worked very well. In addition to the house itself, the neighborhood was safe and peaceful, and there were good connections to the town and the university where I was visiting. At weekend I was able to enjoy the green areas of Jamaica Pond and the paths of Emerald necklace. I would definitely be glad to visit Maria's house again."
9575439,92658893,2016-08-09,2795243,Malin And Jacob,We enjoyed our stay at Marias very much. The house is really beautiful and newly renovated with wooden floors and nice tiled bathroom.
The house isn't brand new,which we loved,and it's good to know that it's not very soundproof if you're easily disturbed. This wasn't any problem for us at all and it was always nice and quiet during the evenings and nights.,,,
Maria was a great host and made it easy for us on our arrival and departure. Even though we didn't have a working us-phone Maria made it easy for us to communicate via the airbnb chat.,,,,,
The neighborhood felt safe and quiet with just a few minutes walk to the T-station which took you to Back Bay in about five stops.,,,,,
"Overall we had a great experience staying with Maria and we would gladly stay with her again. \"",,,,,
9575439,94532645,2016-08-16,56259421,Peter,"We found Maria to be very welcoming on our arrival even though we arrived a little early. Everything in the apartment is high quality. We had some long conversations with her and felt that a friendship was quickly developing. Maria's house is about an 8 minute walk to the station so we had easy access to the sights of Boston. Food,shops and restaurants are within a short walking distance. Maria was a delightful host and we  highly recommend her apartment. Should we be in  Boston again, we would certainly stay with Maria."
9575439,95135736,2016-08-18,44551997,Samuel,Maria's home is very beautiful. It is newly renovated. The room I stayed in was decent sized and has a decent amount of privacy. The neighbourhood is quite friendly too and not far from shops and public transport. It is a nice haven away from the down town. Maria is also a very friendly and helpful host. She will communicate with you often enough to ensure everything is OK. The bathroom is also very clean.
9575439,96232973,2016-08-22,49726363,Mc,A fantastic stay in JP! Thank you Maria for being such a great host :-) Great location close to the T. Spotless flat with fantastic amenities. The area feels very safe and Maria did everything to make my visit stress free and comfortable. I'll be back!
9575439,97942973,2016-08-29,75633134,Andrei,Maria war eine sehr herzliche Gastgeberin die immer hilfsbereit war.
Bei Fragen stand Sie immer zur Verfügung und beantwortete die Fragen schnell und ausführlich.,,,,,
Auch die Kommunikation vor der Anreise verlief gut. Maria Antwortete immer schnell auf Anfragen.,,,,,
Das Haus ist frisch renoviert und man hat ein eigenes Zimmer für sich alleine. Auch ein Badezimmer mit Duschewanne gehört dazu.,,,,,
Die Fotos bei Air BnB entsprechen der Realität.,,,,,
Es ist wirklich ein schönes Haus.,,,,,
Das Haus liegt in einer ruhigen Seitenstraße.,,,,,
Die Orange Line ist zu fuß schnell zu erreichen,womit eine schnelle Verbindung in die Innenstadt von Boston gegeben ist. Aber auch der Stadtteil Jamaica Plain selbst bietet Supermärkte,Imbisse und Restaurants. Ein besonderes Highlight sind meiner Meinung nach die Parks Olmsted Park und Jamaica Pond.,,,
Ich hatte nichts zu bemängeln und bereue es nicht die Unterkunft von Maria gewählt zu haben. Ich kann Marias Unterkunft nur weiter empfehlen und werde sicher auch noch einmal zu Maria nach Boston kommen.,,,,,

This location is 1.5 blocks from the Hynes Convention center which was the reason we were in Boston. If you are attending a conference at the HCC, this is the place to stay.

Use the parking garage on Dalton (approx $30 per day). Its a short walk to the apartment.  Street parking is reserved for Boston residence only.,,,,,
The apartment had everything a person could need. Nice firm beds and clean sheets if you had a need to change your bedding. The kitchen was fully equipped with all the necessities.

197146,7982780,2013-10-11,5391910,David,The apartment is very well located in a great part of Boston to access the town by foot. It was ideal for our 14 year old son and 11 year old daughter with the sofa bed meaning they did not have to share!! The website photos were a very fair representation of the apartment.
The neighborhood was great with a huge variety of shopping locally - food,fashion you name it. The Freedom Trail was my highlight of our 3 week trip to Washington/ New York/New Hampshire/Boston,,,,

10032327,85258215,2016-07-10,72023249,Yishen,"Cristina is very patient and friendly. She sent her husband to meet us, tell us everything and gave us the parking space. The apartment is very good, neat and comfortable. I enjoyed my stay there."
10032327,86880355,2016-07-17,15238740,Pam,"Our stay was great! Clean, comfortable and accurate according to the description and pictures. Nice, safe neighborhood and convenient to the T-train. Modern amenities. Would definitely stay again! Christina was accommodating and easy to communicate with."

10032327,89116572,2016-07-26,4856488,Nikolas,Cristina was more than great in helping me host some family members coming from Greece for medical reasons. She was kind and accommodating and very friendly. I have only positive things to say!! Great host!!
10032327,89919388,2016-07-30,8141389,Masa,"We are a family of three, with a six year old daughter.  Having good access to the T and a parking lot was our biggest motivation, but the apartment itself was certainly pleasant and felt good as well.  Very clean, well decorated, and certainly made us feel welcome and excited.  The bathroom is big and well equipped.  The bedroom very cozy, and extra pillows and blankets allow sleeping comfortably on the couch.  Living room and kitchen very well equipped and organized / user friendly.  We enjoyed cooking, working, going out, and relaxing quite a bit.  Oh and you have to take your shoes off, which for us Japanese was perfect.  Easy access to grocery shopping, and lots of good places to eat within short driving distance.  My wife really didn't want to leave.  Although we couldn't see her in person, Cristina is extremely responsive and helpful, which made us feel secure throughout the experience.  If you are a couple or family of three with a young one, looking for good access to public transportation, want to feel more like living rather than staying at a hotel, this place is highly recommended."
10032327,92022784,2016-08-07,21805709,Sai,"The stay was great in Cristina's apartment. The apartment has everything that we need. Cristina is very considerable and kind. She replied quickly every time I asked her anything. Also, we really enjoyed the rooftop and entertainment room on the second floor. Great experience. Thanks Cristina!"
10032327,93942359,2016-08-14,44337519,Santiago,"Everything was as described! Great location, public transport really close from home what makes it easy to go to the city center."
The apartment was very clean,and the building pretty new. Communication was very good since before our arrival until we left.,,,,

The apartment has such an amazing old charm, nestled in a fantastic neighborhood. If you're going to Boston, this is the way to do it."
3873776,19561134,2014-09-14,9249276,Andria & Justin,Matteo's property is right in the heart of Boston and perfect for multiple people looking to wake up in the city just a stone's throw from everything. Matteo was extremely accommodating during check-in and able to recommend a number of Boston hot-spots for my friends and I.
The building was clearly from another era and does have some quirks like a 2x4 supporting some decorative molding,but the bedrooms were clean,well made,and the common room was comfortable for relaxing.,,
Overall,"a great experience; I'd love to return the next time I'm in the city.\"",,,,
3873776,20775870,2014-10-05,21492404,Ryan,"\"Matteo did a great job having the apartment ready in time, describing the location, making me feel welcome.  He had the apartment cleaned, and even filled the fridge with a flat of bottled water.  The apartment, though clean, was a bit more run-down than I expected.  For example, in the file picture, there is now a 2x4 propped up against the wall, holding up a support beam which runs across the ceiling.  On it is written, \"\"do not move\"\".  I"
The rest of the apartment is similarly in need of TLC (bent door hinges,a closet door which looks like someone had to kick their way out of,etc),but it is very livable.  Probably $1k worth of work + the structural work on the ceiling and it would be great.,,
The location is both the biggest pro and con of the apartment. It is right on Charles street which has a lot going on,making it great to access shops,"bars and restaurants.  It is thus also loud.  \"",,,
3873776,20972823,2014-10-08,2818830,Cronan,Great neighbourhood and location - close to everything. Spacious comfortable apartment. I would recommend Matteo and his apartment.
3873776,21224782,2014-10-13,19951583,Amélie,"My family and I traveled to Boston for a long weekend. Matteo's apartment is in a PRIME location. If your priority is to be in the best possible location, this is a very good option. It's an old Boston apartment, in old Beacon Hill, a beautiful, stunning neighborhood. In spite of being quite old, the apartment was clean and very big, so it's perfect for families or bigger groups. Although we didn't get to meet Matteo, he was attentive to our needs: we wanted a pot and a pan so we could cook breakfast, and he brought them to us. He answered all my questions and willingly provided recommendations for restaurants.  We enjoyed our weekend in Boston. Thanks Matteo!"
3873776,21387094,2014-10-16,4905113,Fan,"Die Wohnung liegt sehr gut, mitten in Beacon Hill, und das ist auch ein idealer Ausgangspunkt um die Stadt zu erkunden. Die Wohnung befindet sich im ersten Stock eines historischen Gebäudes und ist schon ein wenig in die Jahre gekommen."
"Matteo war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit und es gab keinerlei Probleme. \"",,,,,

4934600,42791533,2015-08-15,34566051,Sabrina,Yonatan was a great host. They made us feel so welcome and the place was in perfect condition. Even gave us a gift. I would definitely stay there again.
4934600,42977600,2015-08-16,28480878,Rachel,"Yonatan was a fantastic host! He was very helpful, accommodating, and kind. Even though we arrived kind of late he was there to show us around and make sure we were comfortable. The place was amazingly beautiful and had everything we needed for a great night."
4934600,43337475,2015-08-18,41379975,Roman,"I was frantically trying to find a place for me and my friends to stay when I found this place. It's exactly like the pictures, no gimmicks. The place was amazing with cool amenities, humble host willing to share his knowledge of the area in terms of attractions. Felt right at home and super comfortable with all it had to offer. If I'm ever in Boston again surely i know exactly where I'll be sleeping."

The location was ideal, close to public transportation, a short ride to the center of the city with local neighborhood conveniences to make us comfortable and wanting for nothing.  The apartment was well appointed and very comfortable. I would book with him again."
4934600,45154363,2015-08-31,7220076,Nicky,"Yonatan was a fantastic host. He greeted us warmly, even though we arrived after 11pm. The space was spotless, well stocked with linens (and a few snacks and wine!), and just as pictured. We had a short, 5 minute, walk to the train station and it was just a quick and cheap train ride to get into the heart of downtown Boston. We enjoyed our stay in Dorchester, MA! Thanks so much!"
4934600,45753886,2015-09-05,27558082,Lamar,Awesome! First on my list anytime I am in the Boston area. Thanks again!
4934600,46066999,2015-09-07,35421838,Peiran,"The place is really modern and hi-tech. The air condition system is needed for hot summer in Boston. They provided some snacks and soft drink for us, even a bottle of wine! The bathroom is so huge! If next time I go to Boston, I will definitely choose this place again."
4934600,46628980,2015-09-12,16732361,Thomas,Yonatan met me and explained everything. Neighborhood is ok. Public transport not far.
4934600,46974393,2015-09-14,43106160,Stephanie,This airbnb was amazing! The pictures show true justice! It is very close to the path and I would highly recommend staying here!

Yonathan a été disponible tout le long de notre présence et il y avait des snacks ainsi que des boissons à disposition. Je recommande vivement et j'espère pouvoir revenir prochainement lors d'une autre visite à Boston. Merci !

4934600,49066724,2015-09-30,42033037,Aymeric,We had a really pleasant stay at Yonatan. His place was really clean. He lives upstair the apartment and it's really close to the redline (5-10mins walk and then 5 stops to the city center). We also enjoyed is complimentary wine and sodas.
4934600,49537456,2015-10-04,44913670,Lynn,Newly renovated basement apartment with private access.  Location in Dorchester not heart of Boston.  VERY clean but decorated by a man.  Not enough towels and what's with the VERY large  (used)shampoo bottles and toiletries?  Don't most people bring their own?
"Giant TV great to watch the game.  I came for business.\"",,,,,
4934600,50342578,2015-10-11,1036465,Vanessa,Yonatan was a great host always willing to help us.  The apartment was clean and confortable with everything that you need. 10 min walk to the train station. We definetly will stay here again!
4934600,50664423,2015-10-13,44214193,Cassandra,"Our trip to Boston was fantastic! Yonatan was very welcoming and his apartment was just as we expected it to be. There was no kitchen but we didn't mind that at all; everything was nicely furnished and he left plenty of linens and snacks for us. He also left us a nice bottle of wine which, sadly, we didn't have time to enjoy. The apartment was cozy and close to a lot of things. We never heard a lot of noise and the neighborhood was quiet. We have been raving about our experience to friends and hope we can visit Boston again soon!"
4934600,51441901,2015-10-20,36255177,Bethany,"A girlfriend and I stayed at Yonotan and Yamicia's for our first trip to Boston and we loved it! Yonotan was incredibly flexible from the start and easy to communicate with when working out the details of our stay. The studio has a ton of space while also being very homey and comfortable. They left nice touches, like snacks, wine, a check-in/check-out sheet, as well as a little book of places nearby for dining which we appreciated. The few times we needed to ask Yonotan anything or ran in to him in passing he was always available and extremely friendly. The location of the home is a comfortable walk from the train station and we had absolutely no issues quickly getting to and from many of the popular attractions in Boston or downtown. The only thing I need to mention, which isn't at all a reflection of the hosts, is that the neighborhood surrounding theirs seemed a little seedy in places and, as two young women, we didn't always feel comfortable walking at night. Overall it was a great trip and that's largely because of how well Yonotan and Yamicia have prepared their home for guests. We would recommend it!"
4934600,51780756,2015-10-24,27592805,Hélène,"yonatan was friendly, available by telephone."
the place is good situated,near the metro,at 25 minutes from center of boston.,,,
It's not a real kitchen,you can't coocking. And there are no flatware.,,,,
The mattress is very soft (too much for us).,,,,,
"The place was clean.\"",,,,,
4934600,52321096,2015-10-28,1339562,Nicole,Yonatans place was just as pictured. We were able to park our car in the street and it was easy access to the house.  The living room was very comfy and we enjoyed watching TV on the massive cozy couch.  The bathroom was beautiful.  Better than high class hotel bathrooms!  At least I would assume :) The bedroom was also lovely.  The bed was very comfortable and we also had a TV to watch in there. If I had any questions Yonatan was quick to reply.  I'm bummed we didn't get to meet face to face.  But a very great host nonetheless.
4934600,52602914,2015-10-31,41543486,Laura,"Yonatan's apartment was perfect for our stay, great location and beautiful apartment! The apartment is exactly as shown in the photos (spotlessly clean) and the welcome treats were a lovely surprise! Yonatan was a fantastic host! He was very accommodating,helping us with any queries that we had! :)"
4934600,52969674,2015-11-03,14752794,Steven,"I had a great time staying at Yonatans place, nice little basement unit, private entrance, street parking. It was pretty close to a few eateries and a stores. He left us a few complimentary drinks in the refrigerator as well as snacks and a bottle of wine (which we didn't get around to opening). All in all a great stat and he kept in touch well, I even didn't arrive at the place until about 11:30 at night and he was still available to call when I got there for instructions on how to enter. If you are looking for a place only about 10-15 minutes from the city of Boston consider staying here."
4934600,53333933,2015-11-08,6948913,Chelsea,"Yonatan was a fantastic host. He was responsive and gave great recommendations for restaurants and things to do in Boston since it was my first time visiting the city.

He was friendly, helpful and the apartment was beautiful!  Everything I could have needed was there, including water bottles, wine and snacks, as well as toiletries, cups, bedding, etc.  The apartment was clean, nicely decorated, comfortable and spacious, all at half the price of the cheapest hotel I could find.

Not to mention that I loved that the TV had Netflix installed . Yonatan was great and really nice even left me snacks and soft drinks to have while my stay . Supper close to the train station and not far from downtown Boston that was great :) ! I would recommend anyone to stay at this studio while there stay in Boston .
4934600,57924795,2015-12-30,14043147,Sue,The place was super clean and spacious! I went with two friends and it more than enough room for us and we really enjoyed our stay.

4934600,59299755,2016-01-09,26213482,Devika,"Yonatan was amazingly welcoming. He was very accommodating for check in and check out based on my needs from traveling. He gave amazing recommendations for restaurants to try in the city. It was nice to have Yonatan nearby with text, but didn't feel like he was hovering over my stay. Overall this stay was wonderful and if I ever stayed in Boston again then I would love to stay in the same place again."

4934600,61333443,2016-02-02,52881979,Lovley,It was a great place as far as space. But the parking was the worse I had to drive around to find parking. They have a driveway but they do not allow the guest to park there. Other than that its was cool place to stay.
4934600,61860872,2016-02-08,34831903,Haynden,"The stay was great. He was very nice and let me stay a little longer after my check out time. The place was clean, hotel-like stays. I would definitely come back there in the near future."

4934600,64119223,2016-02-29,37590352,Howard,The space is PERFECT! The entire home was very nicely decorated and the smart TV was a very welcomed surprise. My only feedback from my stay is I would prefer bigger bath towels to dry off with and there were several strands of hair in the bathroom and living room. I would HIGHLY recommend anyone stay here. It's literally blocks from the train and just 12 mins to downtown.
4934600,65107601,2016-03-10,11157142,Char,I stayed in this beautiful downstairs apartment for two nights in early March. Our flight was scheduled to arrive way earlier than expected and I  contacted Yonotan to see if I could drop off our things in the unit and explore the city and come back to check in later. He was so kind to let us come and check in as soon as we landed instead because the unit wasn't being used the previous day. There was a hiccup with getting inside the apartment because the code was incorrect and we had to wait 15 minutes for someone to come but we were grateful to get in much earlier than 4pm. The complimentary beverages and snacks were a nice touch as well. On the flip side of things it stayed extremely cold and we could only keep the temp at 75 because it gets much hotter upstairs in their above home(where the actual owners lived). We had a small space heater that was included but didn't help too much since the outside temp was in the mid 60s. The shower was amazing but it didn't get hot enough -at most it was like warm. Overall a good place to stay but not during the chillier times of the year.
4934600,66050443,2016-03-19,56488913,Adrian,Overall 10/10: Nice Unit. 10 Min Drive to Newberry St. Great Hosts. Very Clean!
CLEANLINESS 10/10: The unit was very clean and very organized. Very easy to navigate.,,,,,
FEATURES 10/10: Alarm for added security. Excellent entertainment setup. Free Wifi. Nest thermometer for personalization.   Comfortable accommodations.,,,,,
HOSTS 10/10: Welcome gift is an amazing touch. Very accommodating to early check-in. This was my experience yours may very based on availability. Great communication.,,,,,

His apartment is really comfortable and  is  even  better  than  the  pictures. The only  thing  to have  in mind is  that  it  isn't located downtown in the  City-center.  However, it was  just a 15 minutes train  and  the  neighbourhood  was  nice  and quite. I Would  definetly recommend  this  place.  One more thing, the bed  was the most  Amazing  bed  I ever  slept  on!"

He provided us with extra towels, toiletries, and complimentary snacks, drinks, and a bottle of wine! Honestly, this studio is better than staying at an expensive hotel. You have everything you need and more: washer and dryer, huge flat screen with Netflix, and Bose sound system. The neighborhood is quiet and the studio is very close to the city. You can either uber or take the T. Overall, we definitely recommend Yonatan's studio and will be booking it again in the future when we visit Boston."

I really liked how you could change the temperature of the room with the phone he had left there for us. There was a lot of extra utilities and amenities that he left for us and they were really useful. The only problem we really had was when we were trying to get into the studio, we had arrived at 10pm and he said the housekeeper would be able to let us in but there was no one there for us. But luckily I found her number on the place ad and we got in no problem with her instructions. Other than that it was a great stay. :) would recommend."
4934600,72774973,2016-05-04,29188276,Michael,Instructions were very clear. Amazing place in a great location. Extremely comfortable and clean space. My next trip back to Boston I will definitely be checking for this place first!

The host was very responsive to our requests for more utensils, plates and a later checkout time. My only complaint is that we heard a lot of noise in the bedroom from the upstairs neighbors. It would have been nice to have more of a kitchen, but we knew up-front that there was only a mini-fridge and microwave."
4934600,75564684,2016-05-22,63787962,Jaime Ann,"Very spacious and clean. 10 minute walk to the nearest train station, dimly lit lower class neighborhood but did not feel unsafe. House keeper and hosts were very helpful getting into the apartment and throughout the stay. Would highly recommend."
4934600,80688078,2016-06-19,5794797,Hristina,Appartement très proche de la station de train. Idéal pour se rendre en centre ville
4934600,82515886,2016-06-27,77990783,Richard,"Very clean house. Nice amenities, like being in a hotel!"
4934600,84857879,2016-07-09,74361099,Shahina,Great experience. Was clean and easy to get to from downtown Boston. All four of us were comfortable and felt safe. Only ask would be to provide extra bedding if accommodating four adults. Thanks for the wonderful experience. We look forward to coming back!
4934600,85869778,2016-07-13,69527567,Toru,"Overall, our stay at Yonatan's was nice. Yonatan is quite responsible. Though it isn't located downtown, it's quite convenient!"
4934600,87783417,2016-07-21,34884495,Steve,"Worst Airbnb experience yet. I'm not sure where all the positive reviews come from. Especially since the purpose of my negative review has been mentioned in numerous reviews. First off, check in time is ridiculous. 4pm?! Hotels don't even have check in that late. This is and will be a problem if you're arriving anytime before 2 pm. I contacted Yonantan about dropping off my luggage while the cleaning lady prepared the place. I was told to contact the cleaning lady. Her information is on the listing as a person of contact. I proceeded to call the number and was greeted with a very rude and unprofessional woman on the other end. She told me I needed to call Yonantan back and arrange a drop off time. They would then relay the information to her. Already a lack of communication. So and so messaged me to let me know he spoke to the cleaning lady and she is aware that I will be arriving at 130 to get the key and drop off my luggage. Mind you, the previous guest checked out by 11am. I arrived to the place at 130 and come in contact with the cleaning lady. Once again she was very rude and unprofessional. She told me she was never notified by Yonantan and was not aware of me stopping by. More lack of communication. She didn't want to give me the key and refused to let me leave my luggage inside. She said I could leave it outside on the porch. Negative. When I tried to show her the message from Yonantan she quickly slammed the door in my face while I was still talking. I was shocked. After 30 minutes I was finally able to get a hold of Yonantan. He told me to leave my luggage on the porch and he would have the cleaning lady put it inside once he got a hold of her. I returned at 11pm later that night to find my luggage sitting outside on the porch!! This isn't the best neighborhood so im lucky it wasn't stolen. I'm not sure the relationship to the cleaning lady but I feel she is a friend or family member. Any employee of mine who is irresponsible, rude and unprofessional would no longer be an employee of mine. Seems like this is a normal pattern for her based on reviews. Nothing has been done and it will cost the owner of this studio money. Oh and no need to set your alarm clock. You will be awakened every morning around 7am by the people upstairs. They are loud! The unit itself is nice on the inside. Newer, remodeled unit. No problems with the wifi, ac, or , hot water. There are complimentary snacks and drinks for guest. Also body wash and shampoo. However the place was a little dirty. There was hair all over the floor. Restroom, bedroom, living room had black hair everywhere. Taking 5 hours to clean a unit, one..."

4934600,92468648,2016-08-08,69925884,Jim,Our stay was perfect. Everything was as described or better. Neighborhood is fine and the redline is a short walk away making all of Boston easily accessible. Thanks Yonatan
4934600,93216412,2016-08-11,27599566,Michelle,Yonatan was very responsive. Upon arrival we were unable to get in touch with the cleaning woman to gain access to the apartment. Yonatan came over in less than 30 minutes to give us the key. The apartment was exactly as shown in the pictures. Very comfortable and perfect for families. The location had plenty of street parking and was walking distance to the train. We were able to explore many areas and neighborhoods of Boston conveniently. The neighborhood is not that great and I don't recommend taking the train home late at night. Best to Uber. During the day and evening it was safe.
4934600,94100739,2016-08-14,36947023,Kristi,The apartment worked great for my daughter and I.  It was accessible to the red line and Uber which was very handy. It also had great air conditioning and was cool in the 90 degree weather which is a bonus. The communication was also great. A good choice for Boston.
4934600,96173467,2016-08-22,36454729,Stefano,"Ho ricevuto indicazioni dettagliate su come accedere all'appartamento e degli snack di benvenuto accompagnati da una bottiglia di vino. L'appartamento è esattamente come nelle foto ma la pulizia ha lasciato a desiderare (dal bagno, al pavimento con alcune formiche, fino alle lenzuola). L'host é stato rapido e disponibile nell'organizzare una pulizia non prevista. Avvistati topi nei pressi dell'ingresso della casa."

4934600,96805320,2016-08-24,74253712,Peter,"We had a great time staying at Yonatan's AirBnB. The place was well furnished and cozy. Street parking is available for those with cars and we never had a issue finding a free space to park in. Great place, definitely worth staying there."
4934600,97240781,2016-08-26,83195013,Sara,"The space is great & very clean. The host left a bottle of wine & snacks for us complimentary. That was very nice. We knew that the location was a good 25-30 minutes from downtown on the subway, however the stop is on a very quiet side street that you would not want to come back to at night if you were not totally at home in this neighborhood. The street that the house is on is very transitional. We have lived in a transitional neighborhood in Chicago so this was not a problem for us, but it may be for others. Parking on the street was fine. There is very little food of interest in the neighborhood. However, we did go to a cute cafe suggested by the host- it is a .4 miles walk."
4934600,98353383,2016-08-30,85984945,Glen,"\"This was a great place to stay. Less than 0.5 mi. from Shawmut for the T and an affordable, convenient spot for visiting Boston. Trip into Boston by car or \"\"T\"\" was easy and the place is comfortably appointed (washer and dryer was a nice bonus). We would not hesitate to stay again.\""
4934600,99352721,2016-09-04,67122966,Stephen,Overall great experience. It was very comfortable and more spacious than I expected. I would definitely stay here again.
7420789,45115082,2015-08-31,38752120,Xinran,"It's been a very good experience. The room is very large, clean and reasonably quiet. Cook is convenient and Ms. Qiu provided pans and flavors. Ms.Qiu is  very nice and gave me useful information for me to better emerse into the new culture."
7420789,47295642,2015-09-17,41902733,Sunny,"It was my fire experience in airbnb and it  made me feel at home.If you have any problem,just ask her,She will tell you tell you everything she know with patience.The taiwan girl living there is very nice  too.I like her very much!She had many traveling experience,so you can hear different stories from her.Everything is wonderful,I recommend everyone to try it!"
7420789,47835557,2015-09-21,43740235,Greta,They were very helpful and polite. I am happy that I took this place!
7420789,51024215,2015-10-17,40954009,John,"I stayed with Ai-Ying, Daniel, and Lily for a month, and they were all super affable and respectful to me. The room was small and shared, but I needed a comfortable place to sleep and work, so it worked out perfectly for me. The place is clean and for the most part quiet. There's a train line right across the street, which truth be told would wake me up at night occasionally, but I got used it to it after a little while. Another nice thing: everyone's a musician in the house, so it was a personal treat for me to listen to whoever was practicing while lazing around. This was my first time using Airbnb, and I hope my future stays goes as smoothly as this one did."
7420789,52416241,2015-10-29,45018181,Pablo,"Great host! Close to bus, and quite easy going. Would recommend!"
7420789,53075229,2015-11-04,18775666,Kevin,"Ay-Ying is a very friendly host. I had to change my plans a couple of times, and she was very easy-going about it. The place itself is very convenient by bus to Harvard and Central square. As others have noted, the train runs very close to the house. I wasn't disturbed by it, but I can imagine others might want to use ear-plugs. All in all, a good place to stay if you are fine with sharing a room."
7420789,53831287,2015-11-13,37691102,Meng,"的位置非常便捷,到哈佛大学、downtown、Newbury street都非常方便,房东提供了出行线路图、地图、charlie card,免去了初来乍到的所有麻烦。house的周围有我最爱的牛排店,味道不错的中餐自助店,CVS和donut,啊啊啊啊,都还没有呆够就该回去了。谢谢你们热情的招待和照顾,很期待下次的相遇:)"
7420789,54200279,2015-11-16,48187201,Sayn,"The host Ai-Ying welcomed in a thoughtful way that she contacted me 2 days earlier before my arrival as the reminder and inquiry to see if I need help, thats so sweet. She was so helpful in everything no matter on accommodation and transpiration approach at her house. She's a pianist and graceful lady with a warm heart. It was a lovely and absolutely comfortable stay. High cost performance even it's like sharing the same room with another lovely and decent lady but since everyone was so decent and thoughtful for others, no awkwardness and embarrassment. It's almost the same as living in an individual room with separated bathroom. I felt very easy and relaxed during my stay, very nice surprise. The house is not close to the subway but very convenient to take buses and also near Harvard and MIT."
这次在Ai-ying家的住宿很开心,性价比很高。感觉就跟在自己家里有独立房间的住宿一样。大家互不干扰还互相关心帮助。很温暖的感觉。感觉波士顿也因此不那么寒冷了。顺便说一句波士顿秋天冬天真的好冷好冷 所以找到一个好的房东真的很重要哦 不但可以让你外面感觉温暖,心里也暖暖的。 怪不得她家都好抢手的。一会就被订掉了。虽然离地铁站有点距离 但是坐公交很方便,"车子来得也不慢。家附近就是CVS 和 餐馆 很方便。\"",,

She was very helpful in helping me with the public transport system, giving useful bus and train maps, and even giving her extra bus/train card. Also the house was just as listed, very \"\"homy\"\" and inviting. The room was also cozy. It's partitioned to give privacy from a super wonderful roommate who is equally helpful.  The location is super close to the bus stop to get to downtown or across the river. Also if you're lucky"
7420789,54730686,2015-11-23,46726543,渠,"It is really a nice experience! The house is located in Havard! Havard is really nice, it has beautiful streets and good cafes. Ai-ying and Daniel are very nice too. The house is clean so as the shared room. They have a curtain to separate the room into two spaces so don't worry about your roommate will bother you. The only thing you need to care about is the bus schedule . It only takes 10minutes to go to Havard sq by bus. But the bus doesn't come very often on weekends , so be sure you check the bus schedule online before going out."
7420789,55030525,2015-11-27,37741119,Kinder,Ar Ying has provided me a looooot of useful information for me to get into her place and she is very thoughtful about whether I can reach her place or not .

Living in sharing room is comfortable and let me feels like at home. The place is very convenient by bus to Harvard, MIT and Boston center. There are New Balance Factory, Starbucks, iHoop and Chinese restaurant nearby the place. If I have an opportunity to go to Boston again, I will choose sharing room again. If you are planning to go to Boston, but haven't decide where to live. Don't hesitate to book the sharing room."

If you love New Balance , there is a big NB factory on the street~lol~    Nice and warm  Ai-ying and her hubby are. The roommate is a girl from Taiwan. All of them are musicians!! The house is tiny and tidy, with big mattress and fast wifi. it is a bit too close to the railway. I was occasionally  waken up by the noise during the night. But I got used to that soon, coz the pillow was very comfortable, maybe  LoL~  Again, Ai-ying is really nice and sweet. I left early in the morning, 3:20 am. And she even left a bottle of water for me on the kitchen table! Really appreciated for that. Oh, my Amazon package was delayed, she also helped me with the Return and Refund.. Oh, Ai-ying, thank you soooo much~"

While  Ai-Ying was out at the time, Daniel was able to greet me, show me around and settle me in. They were both warm and friendly to having me. I thoroughly enjoyed the place, it felt so warm and cozy, especially after a long day out in Boston. The bus line 86 was great and allowed for good access to Harvard and connections to MIT and downtown Boston. The parking next to place was accessible and safe. I enjoyed my stay at Boston, with Ai-Ying and Daniel contributing to that!"

I enjoyed my conversation with Lily (roommate), and I definitely appreciated being able to park right in front of Ai-Ying's home. Like in any major cities where parking spaces are very far and few in between, ample parking space so close to the accommodation  is definitely a plus!

4995033,65019216,2016-03-10,1225015,Martin,"I had an amazing stay at Natasha's apartment. It's smack in the middle of Boston in it's most beautiful neighborhood, and you're just steps away from the Common, Downtown, and Back Bay. There are great restaurants, coffee shops, etc nearby and a Whole Foods/CVS a block away."
The apartment itself is as you see in the photos: surprisingly spacious for Beacon Hill,beautifully appointed and just a light-filled,comfortable place to be when you want to escape the city around you.,,,

It is in the perfect location-in the beautiful Beacon Hill neighborhood and within walking distance to many restaurants, bars, and shops.

However, there was not a closet or a space to put away our clothes and luggage. Also, the apartment was not heated and it was cold inside."
4995033,73625221,2016-05-09,5042121,Rick & Trudi,"Natasha was an extremely prompt and great communicator. Her space was clean, comfortable and very spacious for a Beacon Hill apartment. The space is well-stocked with two beds (one single, one double) a very nice bathroom and comfortable kitchen and living room."
The Beacon Hill location offers great walk-ability of downtown Boston and the surrounding area. It is also close to the T.,,,,,
If I return to Boston in the future,"I would love to stay here again. Thanks!\"",,,,

Natasha left a lot of helpful information for us regarding lights, TV, kitchen, etc. Natasha also responded immediately when I reached out to her with questions. Natasha also had a book on Boston which was informative for me as a newcomer to the area. Thanks for making our stay as great as it could be, Natasha!"
4995033,82157762,2016-06-26,29128814,Kyle,"\"Natasha's place was just as advertised. It was an excellent location in the middle of Beacon Hill. Many of the locations that are \"\"must sees\"\" in Boston are a 10 to 15 min walk or a short uber ride away. Communication with Natasha was good and everything was as she said it would be. The apartment was clean and nicely appointed. The bed and bedding was by far the most comfortable we have experienced with Airbnb! Highly recommend!\""
4995033,86856510,2016-07-17,61581391,Dana,"The apartment was just as described and expected.  It was clean, comfortable, had all the essential amenities, and was very centrally located. Natasha was easy to communicate with and provided us with all the pertinent information regarding our stay.  The proximity of the Whole Foods and Starbucks were very convenient throughout our 4 night stay, and we loved the walk to Charles St. shops and restaurants. The shared roof deck was a very nice bonus. We invited local friends over one evening and enjoyed drinks during the sunset. It was perfect! My husband and I highly recommend this Airbnb."
4995033,92469407,2016-08-08,575290,Jason,"This was a very well-kept, clean, and HOME-feeling kind of place! I especially love the modern design, look, and feel. The lighting was amazing and while I arrived Friday evening one day ahead of my parents (this was a gift for my parents visiting from the west coast), I opted not to go out at all in Boston that Friday (my first time too in this city!) and got some much needed R&R listening to music and relaxing here."

8537786,49385042,2015-10-03,4098047,Matthew,"Room is in a great location, right at the top of historical beacon hill. The house itself has other tenants in the other rooms, sharing a couple of bathrooms. The room itself was fine, had a closet and old fireplace. The window doesn't close all the way, so it was a bit drafty when it was windy outside. Another tenant had made a mess in the bathroom, and after I mentioned this to Sean, he cleaned it up promptly. Sean was easy to communicate with. Overall, the room was very basic but the location was nice."

After reading reviews I knew to expect the stairs up, and the shared bathroom.  Perfect for being able to stay in a historic and beautiful neighborhood, right in the heart of Boston.  The challenge will be staying warm through the cold winter with a drafty window; however knowing Sean, he'll come up with a solution."

Also,I am pretty sure that the room is going to be more and more restored (especially the window that could use some help) as Sean is really a dedicated host and manager of the building. So this comment is going to be obsolete soon I guess. Be advised that there is a 4 stories climb to do,"but Sean has offered me help. Also Sean could help you locate the cool places to hangout or go to eat as well as how works the public transportation.\"",,,
8537786,54899132,2015-11-25,44800413,Francis,The location was great really close to the train station and downtown. I was able to get around easily on foot. Don't rent a car there is no parking. Sean was really helpful and always responsive.

I highly recommend staying here and plan on doing so again!"
13251243,81597509,2016-06-24,68903842,Bethany,"\"This was my first Airbnb experience and I am thrilled with how Carl & Judy took care of everything so I didn't have to put forth any mental effort.  From the time I booked (they sent me a warm welcome within minutes) to the minute I checked out (Carl met me as I walked out with suit case and helped me into my uber), I felt like I was staying with friends, without being smothered.  Examples include a welcome basket with mineral water and microwave popcorn, plus a couple yogurts for breakfast - totally not things I had expected or would expect again.  When I first arrived, I was greeted at the door (!) and shown into the cutest loft cottage I've ever seen.  The place looks like a professional designer set it up - I couldn't believe how simple and high-quality everything was.  I took about 5 uber rides to/from Arborside Guest Cottage and every single driver remarked on what a treasure the area was - so my feeling of a \"\"safe neighborhood\"\" started strong and was affirmed over and over.  When I had a question"
13251243,83517754,2016-07-03,76743016,Sandra,"\"We found Carl & Judy's cottage on a referral from a customer service rep I was working with while registering my teen son for a conference in the Boston area. We were quite happy in \"\"our\"\" little home during our stay at Arborside Cottage. Most amenities of home were provided as well as some wonderful welcome gifts. Quiet and Private. Very close to downtown via train or car. Neighborhood diner is just up the street for breakfast. Was convenient to travel to most areas. Charming community. A walk away from the Arnold Arboretum - you have to visit here"
13251243,83971773,2016-07-05,52246720,Uma,"I visited the place with my parents on the Fourth of July extended weekend, so couldn't bump into either Carl or Judy. But they were both readily available over text and were very prompt. For example, I couldn't find the hair dryer, they had a friend drop by and give one."
The locality is quite peaceful and serene. But it's advisable to have a car if you're staying there with kids or elders. There are frequent buses with a 10 min walk from the stop but if you've gone sightseeing all day and then expect your kids or elders to walk 10/15 min it might be a bit difficult; my mom was a bit tiered.The park/ area around the place is quite tour-worthy though.,,,,,
The place is very home-like in terms of its feel,along with high ceilings and windows that let quanta of the outdoors in. In terms of the facilities everything on the description and much more is there; just like a home. The dry kitchen area was the best,as it had a few pieces of crockery (disposable and regular),a microwave oven,a coffee maker,a kettle
I loved the place,"and the next time I plan to visit with my family I plan to bring a car along. \"",,,,

There is a binder which includes \"\"need to knows/getting around\"\" etc. which was very helpful along with several Boston guide books."
The cottage was very clean & amenities were great! Extra touches such as a snack basket,chilled beverages,and misc. bathroom necessities - all wonderful. You can really tell they went the extra mile to make guests feel comfortable & happy!,,,
The location was great and loved how it’s tucked away in the trees off the street. Easy street parking and access to a quick Uber ride to downtown Boston.,,,,,

The cottage is perfect for a couple and has everything you need. When we got to the house I realized that I had forgotten my toiletries back at home (6 hours away),but thankfully,Carl and Judy had stocked everything to help me get through the weekend.,,,
The cottage doesn't have a full kitchen,but for us this wasn't an inconvenience. The blinds are a bit tricky,but if you read the instructions and persist,you should get them where you want them. I wish the wifi would have been fast enough to be functional,but besides that,this was an excellent place to stay.
Unfortunately,because of our agenda while in Boston and because we arrived much later than we had planned,we didn't get to meet our hosts in person,but they were always communicating with us and making sure our stay was satisfactory.,,

The Arborside Cottage is one of the most amazing retreats I could have hoped for! Truly an oasis just outside the city, it is both beautiful and practical. From the spacious loft style bedroom to well appointed living space and gorgeous high ceilings, the cottage is a real gem! The little touches, welcome basket, decor, and available toiletries make the cottage feel a bit more like home. A close walk to both the commuter rail and the Forest Hills T stop, its easy access to the city made my stay that much more enjoyable.   Hopefully, my future trips to the Boston area will all include a stay at Arborside!"

1340649,82532966,2016-06-28,58513998,Laurin,"My two week stay at Michaela's South Boston home was everything I needed. Subway was literally a 2 minute walk and just three stops to downtown where I was working. The short commute to and from work was a life saver as I was working very long hours. Although the bed is a single, I found it very comfortable (for a petite person). The room had a humidifier, a de-humidifier, a himalayan rock salt lamp that all added to a very relaxing ambience at the end of a long day. Michaela was very accommodating to my needs. She had everything for airbnb guests labeled throughout the house and made things easy to find. The day I arrived was a busy monday and she was very apologetic that she was not able to receive me (although I did not find it bothersome). I was able to easily retrieve the house keys from a lock box out front and navigate the home comfortably. I would recommend the stay for anyone looking for good value, accessibility (subway, uber) and proximity to the beach! Thanks Michaela for a great stay."

We got a great condo in a great area. Initially we booked the condo right after someone else did, and were told that it was unavailable. After I called the company, Kitty and her staff spent hours rearranging things to make us sure that we were back in our original property. Only one star off because I called the local manager with a question about WiFi, and did not receive a call back."

The apartment is at a perfect location,very central,yet very quiet. The unit itself was very spacious,furnished just enough (not too crowded,but everything you need is there). Some items could use some updating,but purely from cosmetic p.o.v. Evenything worked perfectly.

We had a minor issue in our unit (the a/c system drain became clogged and we had a fairly large resulting water leak into the foyer) but a call to Churchill resulted in a quick response."
The location of this unit at Garrison Sq couldn't be much better,you are one block from the Prudential Center (Prudential T station) & Copley Place and about one block from Back Bay Station (take the Greenway if it is nice out).  There is an excellent grocery store within a 5 minute walk.  Everything in Back Bay is within walking distance.  If you like to walk,pretty much all of Boston is within walking distance.,,,
The unit served its purpose in that it gave us needed space for a family of 4 plus a guest.  The unit is a little dated but the only real negative is that the carpeting is about 3 years past needing to be replaced. It is getting pretty nasty and the A/C overflow didn't help.,,,,,
I would not hesitate to use Seemless again and I would certainly stay here again if I needed the space that an apartment like this gives you. We also stayed our first three nights at a nearby hotel (before our entire family was there) and it was superb. Boston's tourism product and the associated hospitality is excellent and,as they pointed out in thanking us for our compliments,"we are comparing it to ours in our home of Charleston (SC) which is consistently rated as one of the best.  Can't wait to go back.\"",,,
21337,8378962,2013-10-28,8007690,Florencia,It was a pleasure our stay and our first experience with airbnb.
The location of the apartment is perfect. Near the Prudential Center,the supermarket,restaurants,train station and Newbury St!,,
The apartment is comfortable and spacious with many cabinets but few hangers to hang (only 5) clothes. I suggest adding more,as well as,tablecloths and / or individuals for the table (there were only 2). There were some details to improve as the formica bathroom furniture missing,,,
Both Seamless service as the concierge were magnificent.,,,,,
"Definitely going back.\"",,,,,

The room has a comfy bed and gets great light and air. One nice touch I found was that he provided pillows with different firmness! Matt himself is an accommodating, laid-back, and friendly host. Don't think twice about booking, and be sure to reserve this fantastic B&B!"
973840,5313277,2013-06-24,5691041,Dana,"Matt is a fantastic host, and his place is beautiful.  Wifi included and we had an amazing breakfast including his housemade bacon.  Oh yes - not to be missed!  The location is great - right next to Franklin park, and very close to a T station."

We walked maybe five minutes to the only subway line we needed to get to all of our destinations. The room was cozy and sweet, with everything we needed to make ourselves at home.  (The shower also has awesome water pressure...a thing you tend to remember when your vacation later includes several camp sites...) As for our host, Matt was comfortable, easy to get along with, knowledgable and super friendly. A really interesting and nice guy. We are so glad he shared his home with us. We hope to stay with him again in the future and maybe get to try the bacon we were too busy to enjoy! Two hearty thumbs up!"

973840,6744470,2013-08-23,595294,Julie,"Matt's place was great for our needs and he is a friendly, generous, and accommodating host. It's just a quick walk to the T station and an easy ride into the city, but Jamaica Plain has plenty of its own charms to explore. We were quite comfortable and I would recommend Matt to anyone coming to Boston, especially those like me who have allergies and sensitivities because he is accommodates such needs by not using strong-smelling detergents on the sheets and towels (which I very much appreciated), keeping the cat out of the bedroom, etc., . Go stay at Matt's!"
973840,7073481,2013-09-05,7984382,Melanie,"We really enjoyed our stay at Matt's house! It's really close to the subway station (5 min walk to Green station) which is very convenient to visit Boston. Matt is really nice, we arrived late thursday night because we had to drive for 7h (we are sorry again) and he waited for us. We really appreciate that. The place was clean and we had enough space in the room for our luggage. The neighborhood was also really quiet. Thank you for your hospitality!"
973840,7710041,2013-09-30,498533,Shervin,My girlfriend and I stayed at Matt's place for 2 nights and really enjoyed it. Matt is a great host who was able to recommend some great places to eat and visit. I look forward to using his place sometime in the future!

L'appartement de Matt est le meilleur rapport qualité/prix pour explorer Boston. Tranquille,confortable et impeccable. Matt a même créé un petit guide touristique de son cru pour nous indiquer les meilleurs restos et activités du coins. Coup de coeur pour le petit café Canto 6 qui se trouve sur le chemin pour se rendre au métro. Pâtisseries artisanales et café divin,"de quoi donner des forces pour marcher toute la journée. Thank's Matt!\"",,,
973840,17225871,2014-08-09,170957,D L,"Matt was a fantastic host.  He accommodated my late arrival, gave me clear directions about the home, and made me feel welcome.  The home itself is spacious and has nice personal touches.  The room was good and I  slept well.  The location is walking distance to the subway so getting downtown was easy.  I would recommend this place to friends and, if I'm visiting Boston, I would not hesitate to stay here again.  Thanks, Matt."
973840,17452303,2014-08-12,6695914,Kristen,"We were very happy with our stay at Matt's place in Jamaica Plain.  The apartment is clean and had everything we needed for our brief visit.  We didn't see Matt much after the first evening, but the communication at the beginning was very good, and he was extremely helpful in helping us find the place when we had issues with our GPS.  There's a big park for jogging right nearby, and plenty of good restaurants within walking distance."
973840,17882145,2014-08-18,19448947,Travis,"Our visit went very smoothly. Communication with Matt was good via cell phone as we made our way to his apartment. His neighborhood was very quiet in the evenings and nights, with only the occasional car stereo driving by. We slept like rocks. The apartment is clean and classy with a nice blend of antique and kitsch. Very hip. Glen road is a short walk from a great park full of trails and wilderness, and if you walk through that park (or take the Forest Hills stop on the Orange line) you can wander the Forest Hills cemetery, which is amazing. There are a couple great places to get food/coffee/pastries on the way to the T (a 5-minute or so walk), and everything is accessible. We parked our car for three days and didn't use it at all. Our stay was peaceful and private, Matt gave us the tour, then made some dinner with a friend and shared a taste of a fine Belgian Ale. We only saw him two more times: the next morning when he showed us where the bacon was, and as we were packing the car. I think our plans just caused us to not really cross paths much, but it was OK. He had some good suggestions for food and stuff, like others have said. When we go to Boston again, we would 100% for sure try to stay at his place again."
973840,18155392,2014-08-22,20214020,Martin,"I felt very welcomed. Matt helped my cab driver to find the place, because his satnav didn't work, then helped me with the luggage up the stairs and gave me a nice quick overview of the house and the city."
973840,18636898,2014-08-29,16581019,Pavel,"I had great experience in Matt's apartment. Matt was very accommodating host, the apartment is in great condition, and actual room is very pleasant and comfortable. Location is in 7 minutes walk from Orange line T station, which worked well for me. Recommended!"
973840,19016720,2014-09-04,19910721,Sophia,"We had a great brief stay. Matt has a lovely, clean home which is in a really vibrant neighbourhood and an easy train ride to the city centre."
973840,19631474,2014-09-15,15541268,Shelby,"Everything was just as expected! Matt was a friendly, funny host who gave us great recommendations for local things to do (including some breweries off of the beaten path, which ended up being some of the highlights of our trip). He even invited us to hang out one evening we got back early, but we had to sleep to get up for our early flight. Matt was prompt to respond to any messages, and he provided clean sheets, towels and blankets, as well as fridge space for any leftovers we had--he even offered the use of toiletries if we had forgotten any, but we had brought our own."
The house is a bit chilly,but with the bedroom door closed + blankets,it's very cozy. Bedroom is also the closest room to the bathroom in the apartment,so it's literally right there for you to use! Though the bed's a full,my tall husband and I were able to fit for a really nice,cozy fit; it's very comfortable and we slept well.
The neighborhood is quiet,but be aware that this means that most things are closed (cafes,convenience stores) at 10 p.m. or later (we had come in a bit late at night and didn't have anywhere to stop for a bite--Matt did very kindly offer us food,but we managed with our airport leftovers). The Sam Adams Brewery is an easy walk,though,from Matt's. House is old
We didn't hear about the famous bacon,"but that's okay ;)\"",,,,

Parking so easy and safe on the street. Overall, great place to stay."

The neighborhood is a funky place where a lot of twenty-something's go to live and buy property.  Good access to the T, bars and restaurants from Matt's place.  I also had a place to park my rental car, which was a must for me."

He provided us with great info on the city and advice for where to go, what to see, and where to eat. His place is right on the subway line which made access to the downtown core easy.

He was very accessible while we were in the house but definitely gave us space. We loved that we were steps away from hiking in Franklin Park as well as a major train station. The house is so clean and orderly while still being welcoming and inviting. The room was a great size and very comfortable and we enjoyed cooking in the whimsical kitchen. Awesome stay!
973840,45826920,2015-09-06,7704463,Julie,"We had a great stay at Matt's! The place was located in a lovely neighbourhood with cute shops and restaurants, lots of green space, and a short walk to the subway line. The price is incredible for the size, quality, and location of the the apartment, compared to many other airbnbs in Boston we'd looked at prior to booking. Though we only had a few minutes to chat upon check-in as we arrived late in the evening, Matt was very welcoming and made himself available for any questions we had before and during our stay. Highly recommend! :)"

The bed and the room in general were very comfortable. The neighborhood felt very safe and walkable as well. Matt made us feel welcome, and basically gave us the run of the place, though admittedly we were barely there to make use of it. He also gave us much appreciated bar and restaurant recommendations, and recommended Salmagundi's hat shop, which was basically our favorite place in the area. Matt's place is close to everything worth seeing in Boston, and all in all, it's a great place to stay! Thanks Matt, sorry we dipped out super early, we were going to miss our flight!"
973840,54199491,2015-11-16,4594986,Sunny,Matt is awesome! He waited till late night for us upon our arrival. The rooms are cozy and comfortable! We love the neighborhood as well. Thank you!

Shoulda gone with Matt in the first place!  I appreciated the flexible check in and check out as well.  I chose the neighborhood because I'd once lived there and was pleased to see that it's even trendier than when I left!  Walking to the Green St. T takes maybe 5 or 6 minutes and feels incredibly safe.  Matt's place and the room are spotless, BTW.  He was gracious with kitchen use, even laundry.  The bed is comfy and the wifi reliable and fast.  I was there for a biz trip so interaction was limited but always coupled with him making sure I had everything I needed.  Very happy to recommend."

Joseph was quick to respond at booking or questions, and he provided detailed write up of his home, appliances, electronics/internet and procedures for check in/out. On this trip, was looking for a well located spot with easy walking/cycling access to the city and it worked out perfectly. This neighborhood if right in front of the park and was just minutes from all the downtown action."
Joseph's place was easy to find,although free parking is a challenge in that area. You can find small grocery and cafe just steps away,and convenient to all Boston sights/activities,making it a great choice for any length stay. I did not get to meet Joseph in person,but after staying in but I would definitely stay there again in the future,and recommend it to anyone seeking accommodations in Boston.

Across the park is the T and downtown crossing. Everything is walking distance. I did a bit of shopping, went to trader Joe's which wasn't too far but a nice walk down a main street with lots of stores. The check in and checkout was simple and easy and the apartment was perfect. Beautifully decorated, clean and cozy. Joseph was very kind. He asked me things I like or what kind of food and made a really nice long list of suggestions for me. It was nice being able to go to the laundry room and do a couple of loads. The people in the building were very nice and polite (Met a few tenants in the elevator) . It was a great experience and it was very homey and comfortable! The bed was very comfortable also. I absolutely recommend this place, and I would love to rent it again sometime! :) Thanks again Joseph!"

The location is convenient - very central and walking distance to Newbury street and right across from Boston Commons (start point to Freedom Trail). While we didn't meet Joseph we communicated with him prior to and during the trip and he was available and gracious. He provided a lot of information on the area, places to eat, grocery shop and parking. I would definitely recommend this place to friends traveling to Boston."

The studio was in a great neighborhood near so many things. We were able to walk to most everything to sight see. The only issue we had was the cleanliness of the studio. Dirt on the windowsills and the bathtub looked like it had never been cleaned. I had terrible allergies while staying there.

The apartment is big enough for 3 (2 on the bed, 1 on couch) but was perfect for 2 singles. The place was clean and neat, with plenty of towels & blankets.  The kitchen was small, but efficient (but I couldn't find the toaster) with a microwave, stove, refrig. & coffee pot...you know, the essentials! He has a big TV & internet, but we were too busy to even turn them on."
Next time I come to Boston I hope that I can rent Joseph's place again,"I know my husband would love it too. Thanks Joseph for letting us enjoy \"\"being locals\"\" in your home!\"",,,,
3432321,20499961,2014-09-30,7424902,Yoav,The place was great!

Joseph was also great,very responsive and helpful.,,,,

3432321,20747126,2014-10-05,2172960,Sarah,"Checkin was fairly easy.  We picked up the keys at The Taj concierge desk 2 blocks away from the property.  The location was perfect.  2 blocks from the Arlington stop on the Green Line, but we walked to just about everything.  Freedom trail started at Boston Common not far from the property.  Apt was perfect for 2 people or maybe 3.  We never saw the owner of the property, but he was reachable by text message when needed.  I would recommend this property!"
3432321,20901605,2014-10-07,12244711,Steven,I stayed at this apartment for 2 nights and the apartment is perfectly situated. We were able to walk to everything in and around Boston.
The apartment itself is clean,basic and has everything you would need for a short stay.,,,,

3432321,21290089,2014-10-14,19919328,James,"We had a great short stay here :) The apartment is in a fantastic location, we loved the beacon hill area with lots of boutique shops nearby and the public gardens directly opposite the apartment. The studio is clean, in a very well maintained building with everything you need for the stay. Joseph was very helpful in accommodating our late night arrival and late checkout."
3432321,21392778,2014-10-16,3710859,Kim,Joseph was a wonderful host.  He was very prompt and thorough in his communications with us.  His apartment is in a perfect location.  It was clean and very comfortable.  Highly recommend!!

3432321,21961177,2014-10-27,21661506,Tom,"Our host Joseph was very accommodating - He provided basic groceries, and some unexpected treats. The apartment was lovely as described. We felt that it was in the best possible location across from the Public Garden- near the Boston Commons, and the Charles River, all terrific walks. There is easy access to transportation, shopping and restaurants (Just a block away from famous Cheers pub which we enjoyed). Hope to return there again on our next visit."
3432321,22171810,2014-10-31,8774569,Nicole,"Great apartment in the ideal location for downtown Boston. Joseph was easy to contact, replied back to us right away and was very flexible with check in/check out times.  The  studio apartment was as described.  The keys were easy to get to access the apartment.  The best part was the location which is ideal for getting anywhere in Boston and is in the beautiful Beacon Hill location. Thanks for a great stay Joseph and for being so accomodating"
3432321,22380875,2014-11-04,22857266,Britany,"We really enjoyed our 4 night stay in the apartment. The location is great and the apartment was clean, comfortable and welcoming. Joseph was responsive and very helpful in accommodating our late check out request. The recommendations for the area were also very much appreciated and enjoyed."
3432321,22532894,2014-11-09,21734258,Sarah,"This studio apartment was wonderful for two people.  The location is absolutely perfect for exploring Boston.  Quiet building, with windows on a side street so it is also quiet at night.  Lovely space.  Joseph made it so easy for us and made us feel very welcome.  We'd definitely come back.  Thanks so much."
3432321,22725208,2014-11-12,1877838,Nick,Place was exactly as described. Pleasent clean and perfect location for wandering Boston. Host was great even though I did not meet him his instructions were clear and he left some helpful information in the apartment. Roofdeck was awesome!
3432321,22766578,2014-11-14,12152966,Cathy,"Joseph was a prompt and thoughtful host who communicated regularly at key points during my stay.  This apartment is all about location, which is superb.  It is surprisingly quiet, despite its easy access to many Boston destinations. I appreciated the invitation to eat any food in the fridge (I made a fried egg for breakfast - Thanks!). The couch and easy chair are comfortable, but are the only places to sit, even while eating a meal.  The building is older with well-kept common areas but the apartment shows its age (drafty windows, discolored bathtub, etc).  Thoughtful decisions about furnishings and layout, sparkling bathroom sink and fixtures, and good quality pots and pans tip the balance for me, so I'd happily stay here again for a longer stay to leverage the steep cleaning fee. Rooftop deck was a great place to watch the National Guard flyover!"
3432321,22897322,2014-11-17,11615075,Sam,Joseph's place is in a fantastic location and well presented.

3432321,26451069,2015-02-13,25734770,Jenny,"We initially planned to stay in Joseph's apartment for two weeks while we searched for longer term accommodation in the city. It has now been six weeks and we still don't want to leave. The location is perfect for exploring all that Boston has to offer, the studio is cozy and warming and Joseph has been extremely helpful and responsive during our stay. I can't recommend this place highly enough."

It was in a fabulous location within walking distance to just about everything (even in the midst of a crazy snowstorm when we were there) and had plenty of space. The kitchen was big, the living room area was sunny and comfy, and the bed was warm and cozy. Joseph was great about being in touch via airbnb and making sure we got the keys and arrived and everything was OK. He gave us great recommendations for dinner and activities since it was my first time in Boston. Would definitely recommend staying here if you're in the city!!"

3432321,30872317,2015-04-28,413505,Kazuo,"Two of us stayed at Joseph's studio for five nights in April 2015. It is well located, the Boston Public Garden is across the street and Arlington metro station is a 450m walk along the Arlington Street. Joseph is easily reachable and replies quickly.  We picked up the keys at the Taj Hotel concierge, 300m from the apartment building. Some few furnishings in the studio are different as in the pictures, but overall is the same. Nothing that will impact your stay. Internet Wi-Fi worked well. The coin laundry in the ground floor was very convenient. I would stay here again."

3432321,32821062,2015-05-22,2734031,Asya,We had an excellent trip to Boston in large part thanks to Joseph. He was super responsive and accommodating. The condo is on Beacon Hill and in a perfect location for walking or taking the T. We loved exploring the area and running on the esplanade by the Charles River.
Joseph provided everything we could possibly need and the condo was spacious,"comfortable and clean. We would highly recommend this booking to everyone who wants a perfect location to explore Boston.\"",,,,

Joseph was very attentive and accommodating about parking information, where to pick up and drop off keys, transit options and area restaurants, and even offered additional information he thought we might find helpful.  We had a wonderful visit and would love to come back!"

3432321,33495210,2015-05-29,27371573,Michele,Finding a reasonably-priced place to stay for Harvard graduation in May 2015 was a nightmare.  This location - close to the Boston Park (for relaxation) and close to the T for  travelling back and forth to Cambridge was the best.
The apartment met all our needs except there was no cable for sports as hoped by my husband. (smile),,,,,
Joseph always answered questions in a timely manner. He was personable wishing our family well for graduation.,,,,,
It took the stress out of graduation.  Thank you Joseph for being the best host ever.,,,,,

3432321,33804888,2015-06-01,15398086,Aj,"Joseph did a great job of staying in touch and responding to any questions I had. He went above and beyond to ensure we were able to get the keys even with a complicated travel schedule. The property itself was ideal. It was spacious and located in a beautiful neighborhood. Within a 10 minute walk to the T for easy transportation.  It had A/C which was nice for the warm weather we had during our stay. There was a kitchen, laundry (pay laundry) and a rooftop deck available to use. Overall a wonderful stay, I will definitely be back my next trip to Boston."
3432321,34074647,2015-06-04,19890892,Brad,Excellent communication by Joseph. Location is ideal and would not hesitate to book again. Apartment was warm and inviting as well.

3432321,34575918,2015-06-09,9172325,Sarah,"Joseph's Beacon Hill apartment is perfectly located, spotless, and has all the authentic charm of its surroundings. I found it to be just the right size for one or two. You have everything you need - a well equipped kitchen, bathroom, and a comfortable living space with a sleeping alcove. It is well decorated, and since it faces the side street, reasonably quiet. I loved being just a block or two from the restaurants and shops on Charles St. as well as right across the street from the Public Garden. You can easily walk almost anywhere in the city. Joseph was easy to communicate with and the arrival and departure procedures couldn't have been simpler. I would highly recommend a stay in this lovely studio in the best neighborhood in Boston! Thanks for making this place available Joseph!"
3432321,34774101,2015-06-12,19719893,Peter,"with only 2 days to explore Boston, the location was perfect for us. Easy to access all major attractions, and across road from public garden and Boston Common, block from Cheers bar. Whilst we did not get to meet Joseph, he was quick, clear and easy to communicate with. The unit was as described, clean, comfortable and well appointed with all cooking appliances & utensils also large refrigerator. Highly recommend this apartment for single or couple looking for special stay in Boston."
3432321,35227130,2015-06-16,32627149,Carolyn,"Joe was great to work with from beginning to end. The studio apartment was lovely and even better than I expected - just perfect for my son and I to use as home base for our 4-day sightseeing trip to Boston.  Joe sent the keys in advance (very helpful!), gave advice on what to do in Boston and tips on the apartment, and was in touch periodically during our stay to make sure all was well.  The neighborhood was great - we couldn't have asked for a better location right across from the beautiful Public Garden and with Charles St restaurants rights around the the corner. We highly recommend everything about it!"
3432321,36174788,2015-06-26,29929016,Tiffany,"We had a wonderful time in Boston and Joseph's apartment was a great place to stay.

His studio is cosy, nicely decorated so that you can immediately feel at home. And it is superbly situated, almost everything is within walking distance, but the T is very close if needed."
Joseph was very pleasant to communicate with,was always quick in answering any question and very helpful in all matters. He even spontanously got an air mattress and extra sheet organised so that we could accomodate 2 extra guests for 2 nights (one on the sofa and one on the air mattress).,,,,
If ever we were lucky enough to be back in Boston some day,we definitely would love to stay in your studio again,Joseph! Thanks!,,,

Our flight arrived late, but Joseph had arranged a way for us to get the key. The apartment was clean, had everything we needed, and was in a great location across from the Boston Public Garden (very safe & quiet neighbourhood), near the T, and walking distance from many restaurants & sights. Joseph had even left info on what to do in Boston and handy tips about restaurants, supermarkets, etc, in the neighbourhood, & checked on us via email to see if we needed anything. It was great to have our own space when staying for 10 days, esp when we both had conferences to attend. Would definitely stay again!"
3432321,40365363,2015-07-30,38084849,Mark,"\"In real estate it is all about location.  You can't beat this address.  Truly walking distance from food, sights and transportation.  I even walked back from Fenway Park after the Red Sox forgot how to play baseball on July 28, 2015.  Still, it was a fabulous time.  92 Beacon St. is a great value for lodging.  The only hiccup was a Comcast Cable Box failure which Joseph was \"\"Johnny on the spot\"\" about resolving.  Didn't bother me"

3432321,41877290,2015-08-09,34397887,Balazs,"We spent a weekend in Joseph's nice studio. The location of the apartment is fantastic as it's right next to Boston Public Garden (and the Cheers bar :) ), so it's comfortable to walk to the downtown, follow the Freedom trail, have a dinner on Beacon Hill or a morning walk on the Esplanade."
Unfortunately we haven't met Joseph personally so picking up the keys was a bit more complicated than usually,"but otherwise our stay was perfect.\"",,,,
3432321,42303100,2015-08-12,35253394,Carroll,Great place- location just off the Public Garden is unbeatable. Apartment is old but very neat and clean. I would happily stay here again.

The Beacon Hill neighborhood is the most sought after and prestigious real estate in Boston for a reason,and this location provides the opportunity to enjoy for a price that a well-seasoned traveler would take advantage of in a heartbeat.,,,,
And after spending the day walking all over Boston,this location offers you dinner however you fancy: be it walking a block to Charles Street to order a delicious $19 takeaway ‘upper crust’ pizza to take and enjoy for an evening in the world-renown Boston public gardens across the street,or dine in at a 5-start restaurant four minutes away.,,,
The flat is perfect for those who want to really appreciate Boston for a few days,or weeks; the furnishings and accommodations are exactly as described,and the building itself is quiet,respectable,and subtly requires the same of its visitors in return.,
I give this flat my highest recommendations,"and look forward to staying here on my next visit. \"",,,,

He was gracious enough to allow me to drop off my luggage early to explore the city. The green line on the T was conveniently located and a easy ride - off Arlington. There was a Chi hairdryer and fresh coffee waiting, which I loved. Would highly recommend this location for anyone visiting the city. The public park across the street, commons and Charles river are all near by."
3432321,47109700,2015-09-15,5400941,Mark,Great apartment. Great location. Couldn't have been better.
3432321,47359968,2015-09-18,38603850,Kelly,"Joseph is very responsible who always got back to answer our questions immideatly. The location is the best in Boston that we were able to walk around those major attractions such as Charles River, Puclic Garden and Prodencial mall. Also there are two T stations nearby that we can easily walk to get to go everywhere in city. ...many good restaurants nearby. we were happy to stay in his place for 3 nights."
3432321,48120995,2015-09-23,43358768,Leah,"Nice little efficiency apartment. No frills space with a great location and very clean. A flight of stairs to the basement level is the only entrance to the building. The elevator is a bit fritzy; if you need to carry bags upstairs it is more like 2.5 flights. Cute little space though and the host was very easy with communication and paperwork in the unit. At 300$ a night when you include cleaning and other fees, it rivaled great hotels in the neighborhood in price, but the kitchen and privacy made it a worth-while alternative."
3432321,48937196,2015-09-29,17164694,Paula,"Joseph's apartment is lovely and comfortable. It's kept very clean, is well equipped and stocked with everything you could need. The location is super, right beside Boston Common in a beautiful neighbourhood. Joseph was very responsive to queries and left a helpful guide in the apartment too. Wish I could have stayed for longer!"
3432321,49633066,2015-10-05,40434963,Dan,Joseph's apartment was very convenient and was a nice and cozy apartment.  It is situated one block from Cheers right across the street from Boston Commons and one block from the Charles River.  It was clean and all the amenities were provided.  He was easy to communicate with.  Uber was always easy to get hold of.  The only suggestion I made to him is that the cardboard he has taped around the air conditioner was coming unattached and cold air was getting in.  We had to turn up the heat and I was okay with it but it was still a bit chilly for my girlfriend.  I know the seasons are just now changing so it was probably not a problem until just this past weekend. I am sure Joseph will have it taken care of and it did not impact the trip much at all.  All was as he said it was and he got me the keys in plenty of time.  He was a good host.
3432321,49927744,2015-10-07,44365954,Alexander,"This is a great condo in a fantastic location. The place was very clean and tidy, and had all the amenities we needed.

The apartment was in a fantastic location opposite the beautiful Boston (URL HIDDEN) was warm ; clean and very welcoming. The coffee machine and coffee were a lovely touch. There is a laundry in the building which as a traveller I found very handy. The surrounding area has lots of great eateries on Charles street { Joseph left some great recommendations }Would stay here again .
3432321,51546807,2015-10-21,23614000,Kimberly,The place was exactly as described and actually seemed bigger than shown in the pictures. It was very clean and the location is perfect for walking to many restaurants and attractions. Joseph was very responsive and thorough in his instructions as well as incredibly helpful in places to see and things to do in the area. I would recommend this place to anyone.

Starbucks, local pub, and restaurants were 5 minutes away.  We walked everywhere but the T is close.  Felt very safe there.  Easy to contact Joseph but no need.  Very good instructions and communication.  Would definitely stay there again if we are fortunate to be in Boston again!!  Thanks so much Joseph."
22212,199431,2011-03-15,281464,Inga,"The Location was fabulous! The apartment was not like the pictures, the apartment is on ground level and when you enter it, you have to walk down some stairs before entering the apartment.  The apartment was comfortable, but the refrigerator gave a sound so we had to turn it off during the night.  The apartment was clean, but a bit tired in some places (walls, carpet)."
Few steps away from Newbury street,and I mean few steps away! It is soo close. The next train station is on the right side of Newbury,next to Best Buy. Once we discovered that the subway was 3 minutes away,and Starbucks as well,everything fell into place.,

22212,970769,2012-03-05,1585467,Anna,"The apartment was great and well equipped. The only thing slightly negative was that one of the rooms was not properly separated from the living room (there is a spacing between the wall and the ceiling). For us this was not a problem at all, but maybe for others"
22212,1167859,2012-04-23,1836500,Lawrence,"Our stay was just wonderful!  The apartment was exactly like the photos and very clean.  Next time I am in Boston,  I will definitely stay here again.

22212,5032487,2013-06-09,995371,Jonathan,"Clean, toiletries and towels provided, amazing location right near Newbury St., and the code entry was really convenient to use.

22212,35707230,2015-06-21,34750362,Laure,"Nous avons passé in weekend a Boston tres agréable. L'appartement est très bien placé, dans un quartier tres anime et tres charmant. Nous avons cependant ete un peu déçu car l'appartement est en sous sol ce qui implique un grand escalier (pas idéal pour nous puisque nous avons un petit garçon d'un an qui voulait grimper les escaliers sans arrêt) et un manque de lumière ... Appartement tres sombre, parfait si vous n'y êtes que pour dormir, mais un peu triste le matin...! Un autre point négatif: il y a un accès rue au niveau de l'appartement, qui donne sur une petite cour tres sale. L'immeuble extérieurement est charmant. L'appartement est bien équipe. Globalement un peu déçus pour le prix de la nuit!"
22212,37653475,2015-07-09,29491919,Jason,"Pros: Basically the location is extremely convenient in the Bay Back area, a turn away from Newbury Street. You are just steps away from shops, Prudential Centre, and tons of restaurants. There is even a city bike rent station just across the street."
Cons: As pictured,but guests should know the unit is located in a basement that lack windows. So you are dependant on the air con / internal heat vents. If you have a lot of luggage,"you will need to carry them down a narrow set of stairs. Also the decor is very tired. No Washer / Dryer. Also the second bedroom has a large gap above the door wall which could disturb light sleepers if you are going in and out. \"",,,

22212,50117731,2015-10-09,45072414,R.,Stayed in this appartment in the Back Bay for 5 days together with my colleague as an alternative for a Hotel because of crazy room rates in October (Indian Summer ??)
Communication with Seamless was excellent; clear and swift. I had an early arrival and they arranged for me I could enter early.,,,,,
The appartment was nice and clean,has a small but good equipped kitchen,a big livingroom with flatscreen and Nice seats. The appartment is partly below streetlevel,so not so much daylight. It has two seperate bed rooms (only one has a TV),the bathroom and the kitchen/livingroom are shared. The shower is great. The backdoor of the appartment opens onto a quiet backalley and could have had some better locks for the feeling of safety.,
The neighbourhood was very nice,also felt save outside  late in the evening. Right around the corner of Newbury street and close to Boylston. So all the cool stores and restaurants in walking distance. We did breakfast every day at 7 in WhichIT on Newbury; worth a recommendation. The T- greenline ( the subway) stop at Hynes Conventioncenter which was a 5 minute walk. It took us right into the financial district where our office was.,,,,
In conclusion,I can recommend both Seamless and this appartment.,,,,

22212,51071717,2015-10-17,38823940,Beth,"Our experience was good. We were missing a few things that took me calling 3 times and all day to finally get... Those items were dishwasher soap, dish soap and toilet paper. The garbage disposal and air conditioning didn't work. And the cleaning company left a bag of garbage on the counter when we arrived that we had to clean up and throw away. Other things that we enjoyed were the location, two bedrooms, and the apartment was clean. The host company was easy to get ahold of and were always accommodating."
22212,53681261,2015-11-11,43712700,Harry,"The apartment was lovely and exactly as described - perfect for our needs which was a comfy, clean apartment for a couple of nights whilst we explored Boston."
The neighbourhood was very nice also and was safe with plenty of shops,restaurants and bars within walking distance. Harvard is a short taxi ride away and was nice to walkaround.,,,,

Family of 5 rented this for 6 nights instead of booking 2 hotel rooms; saved some money but also had great access.  Only comment is that one bathroom was a bit of a challenge for 3 teenagers and 2 parents!  But we managed.  Would rent again."

1161210,4958643,2013-06-03,5472793,Emily,"We loved our stay with the Zhangs. We are a 28-year old couple, and their children are around our age but all off on impressive endeavors, so they treated us like family. They made a delicious Chinese feast complete with organic veggies from their garden, and we were invited to help ourselves to anything anytime. They even offered to give us rides or pick us up late at night when we went out."
The house was sparklingly clean,spacious,and comfortable,and the room sunny and quiet. We had our own bathroom,and no one else occupied the whole floor.,
A note on transportation: It is 2 minutes from the 36 bus,which is about 15 minutes to the end of the T line. It took us 40 minutes to get to downtown. Coming home at 9 PM took 1.5 hours though. The bus can be unreliable.,,,,
Nancy has a spare CharlieCard - be sure to use this as it will save you a lot of $. And leave time to get around by public transport.,,,,,

They welcomed us with watermelon and tea even though we arrived very late. We had a nice talk around the dinner table with the other guests soon after our arrival. The room looked exactly like the photo- very clean and tidy. The neighborhood was very quiet and safe. Junzuo was kind enough to give my mom a ride to Boston College (where I was) on a rainy morning. When they visit Seattle, they will definitely be welcomed to our home."

We stayed there for one night because had to take the IELTS test the next morning in the nearby Mount Ida Collage. It is the closest and cheapest place we could find to stay over, but the service was way better than that even in the hotels. Warm-hearted hosts, tidy bedroom, nice breakfast, good wifi access, friendly neighbors, safe community. Since we don’t have car and there was no bus on the weekend to the test site, the nice family drove us to the college the afternoon before the test day so that we could get familiar with the environment, and drove us early morning on the test day and even drove us to the subway station after the test. Many great thanks to their kindness and hospitality, kind of returning back home, best ever I have met. Even though it was the first time for me to stay in a home stay, I can tell their service can't be beat, recommend to check it out !"

She invited us to eat dinner with them.  She's a full time teacher and cooks great food.  Charles helped us understand the bus and train system.  Jim helped us with maps and bike routes. Junzuo was extremely intelligent and interesting to talk to."

We picked the Muching's home in West Roxbury, because of location and favorable reviews, and we were delighted with our choice.  We were met at the door by Charles upon our arrival in the afternoon, who showed us to our room, and gave a tour of the house."
We had plans to go into Boston for dinner,about 30 minute drive through some beautiful parts of Boston area. We met Nancy and Junzuo upon our return later that night. They are lovely and interesting people - we are sorry we did not have more time to spend time talking with them.  They let us know that they would be leaving early in the morning,but showed us around the kitchen,and had set aside coffee and breakfast items on the counter for the morning.,,
Our bedroom and bed was very comfortable and private.  Our own bathroom right next door was clean and well equipped,with fresh towels and toiletries.  The house is in a quiet neighborhood and felt very safe.  No problem parking our car right in front.,,,,

1161210,7468931,2013-09-21,8737800,Stan,We got a great welcome and even got picked up from the Station although as we later found out the T (undeground) and bus service are very good and once you have got your head round the way to do it it is actually fairly easy as long as you pay attention. The bus stop is about 150yards (120Meters) from the front door and you only need to remember to get of at Baker Street on the way back. It takes about 50 mins to get in or out of Boston but that should not put you off if anything it is a bonus being a bit further out. It is not a city centre flat but it is in a very nice neighberhood and everyone from the bus drivers to people we met were friendly and helpful. This is a place that makes you feel at home and the whole family are very welcoming and happy to share tips for getting around Boston and what to see. We will be back if we are in Boston again and will recommend it to any friends that go to Boston.  The room was clean and comfortable and we had access to the TV if we wanted it. The bathroom was also clean and the kitchen was as well. Breakfast was nice and simple and fruit was also available.

First I went off the bus too early so I called Muching's mum for help who then immediately came to pick me up by car. Upon arrival in the house, which is absolutely clean and lovely, I was invited for dinner with the family. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, access to downtown Boston easy, though a but lengthy. Still, I would never stay anywhere else in Boston than with the Zhang family. When I came home it really felt like exactly that: coming home after a long day. There was no evening without a great conversation with one of the people in the house. One word: Fantastic!"

Me and a colleague of mine stayed there in two separate rooms for about two weeks and our hosts, the Zhang family, were exceptionally friendly and hospitable. They were also very attentive to whatever requests we had and even treated us with delicious home-made food. The location is nice and safe in late hours. And if you use public transport make sure you plan enough time for a bus ride to the Forest Hills since the bus is sometimes late."
Dear hosts,I wish I could stay longer. Many nice and respectful guests to you. Thanks a lot!,,,,

Since our son was a bit cranky, as most kids are when you take them out, we had our fair share of trouble trying to handle him but the Zhang family was very patient and friendly."

Met us at the front door and immediatly sat us down and offered us drinks. We arrived later than expected but there was no issue . The rooms offered were decorated and cozy, and te bathroom had all necessities ! They even had options for what to eat for breakfast. I couldn't be more pleased with our stay here . We hope to see them again soon!"
1161210,8426531,2013-10-30,7905030,Sally,"\"To call this wonderful would be an understatement. Our family of 4 stayed for 4 nights & were hosted by Muching's lovely mother.  By the end of our stay we honestly felt like family!  Nancy was incredibly generous with her time, her self and her home.  If you are a private person/group, I am sure Nancy would leave you to yourselves (if you wanted) but if you like, she is more than willing to show you around her local area and further if desired. She gave us an \"\"orientation\"\" of her suburb upon arrival to help orientate us & it was wonderful.  We immediately felt at home. She also gave us a tour of the parts we missed upon our departure.  What a woman."
Best parts:,,,,,
- loving,warm Boston family,,,,
"- \"\"t\"\" bus leaves from 1 min walk away & drops straight at Forrest Hills station.  I caught with stroller each day & had no problems as all T  busses are wheelchair accessible. We also found mingling with locals on the bus great & very different to normal sullen inner city public transport.",,,,,

She was able make our stay easy and delightful, as well as the free Bus and Subway passes we literally did not have to pay anything to get around Boston. It was a wonderful stay and I would recommend it to everyone. Just know that the location is a bit further away from the city so it takes about a 15-20 minute bus ride to the Orange line stop and from there about a 10 minute train ride into the downtown Boston area."

We got to choose between a room with blinds or a room with dark curtains, had freedom to use most of the house, and to use the kitchen whenever we needed to. There were other perks that I won't list here, as it would be up to Nancy and her husband to offer them or not. The house is lovely, on a quiet street off a main street. They are very friendly people, but allow guests plenty of privacy as well. I highly recommend this place."

The house is very clean and well looked after and nancy and her husband ensured we had everything in place, what we might need. While they are also staying in the same house , we had our space( given we went as a family) and we had kitchen to our selves , which Nancy s husband ensured was well stocked. We spend time chatting with them and it was a pleasure as both of them ( Nancy and her husband) are wonderful people and great hosts. From convenience perspective , if you have a car, there is no parking problem , and it is a nice neighborhood and not too far from main places to visit. I would definitely recommend their place to anyone considering staying arrangements in boston."

The house is well equipped with toiletries, breakfast, very clean and cultured.

"She invited me to dinner with her family and they were all very conversational and we easily found similar points of interest that kept our conversation rolling for hours. She also recognized when I was feeling \"\"less social\"\" and wasn't intrusive in any way. The room was simple",clean,and comfortable and there was plenty of room for me to grind out a few work tasks during my stay. Through her experiences both from her children and with her guests she has an abundance of perspective and interesting conversation to share and I'd highly recommend having a chat over a cup of tea (she has an arsenal to choose from!).,,,

They picked up from the airport and offered to send us to the nearest subway station. We were invited to have dinner with them every night as well as breakfast. The room is clean and cozy with a spacious bath. Can't wait to go back there!

There was everything you would expect from a BnB. The breakfast was great, and the house was conveniently located close to the bus station that takes you to the subway. It's less than an hour ride to downtown Boston, and the quite at night was appreciated. We didn't have to worry about anything and our hostess went to great lengths to make our stay as pleasant as possible. I highly recommend it."

They were always eager to assist us in anything and we had the opportunity to enjoy both their cooking for breakfast. We also met Charles, their relative, who was equally as helpful. No one was intrusive at all. The hosts were also great for conversation, especially Nancy's husband who was super nice and served us these sesame buns that we will never forget. They're also REALLY clean...I didn't find a speck of dust or crumb unless it was caused by me."

Ms yang picked us up when it was pretty late and windy, and drove us to the subway in the very early morning as we needed to catch early flight. Their home is very conveniently located. Bus stop is two minutes walk away, a grocery store is ten minutes walk away. When we took the bus downtown, we enjoyed the boston-style buildings. The room is exactly the same as described, very clean, warm and comfortable. I strongly recommend visitors staying in their home!"

The only problem we had was with transportation because the house is a bit far from the metro, the bus doesn't really follow the schedule and we had really big and heavy suitcases. If you have a car is an great place for there is a parking lot right in front. If you're going to use bus and metro you might have to wait a bit, but the house is so nice that I think it compensates."
1161210,11569360,2014-04-07,6505636,Kyle,"Staying with Mrs Yang and her husband was an absolute pleasure. The bedrooms and bathroom were clean and comfortable, the whole home was absolutely spotless!

1161210,11619328,2014-04-09,2326946,Emily,"I'm always extremely hesitant about leaving a less than happy review, but sometimes an unhappy airbnb stay happens. I was clear with my host (Nancy) that I would arrive around 6 pm and would leave very shortly after to meet friends for dinner across town. When I arrived at the house at 5:45 I was greeted by a live-in relative (Charles) who did not know I was coming, which was very unsettling. He asked me to wait in the living room while he called Nancy but I had to insist that I be allowed to settle and unpack in my room since I was on a schedule. I was on a very quick business/personal trip, so I stayed at this house for only one night as I tried to squeeze everything into my itinerary as efficiently as possible. After he spoke on the phone with Nancy and confirmed my presence as a guest, he gave my a tour of the house and amenities. When he asked if I needed anything else I laughed, and mixed in with my regular friendly fare I told him I required only 2 things from any stay, a good nights sleep...and coffee in the morning, he shook his head in understanding. I couldn't get to sleep that night because I could hear two people engaging in a considerably loud conversation as they made other noises in the kitchen until 12:30 at night...and a printer going and going along with it in the background. I'm pretty laid back and don't require much when staying away from home since I come prepared, but I was disappointed with my experience here due to the external late night noise. But personally, the part that left the worst taste in my mouth was the next morning when I was trying to get out the door at 8:30am. Not only was there no fresh hot java flowing, but waiting for me on the counter was a pot of cold leftover coffee and a filter full of grounds...I was floored!"
1161210,11787919,2014-04-15,9683234,Thomas,"Our hosts were excellent. Very friendly people, who would do anything we asked or needed of them. Very informative whenever we asked questions about anything. Overall a very pleasant experience, and I would recommend staying here to anyone who asks."
1161210,11886131,2014-04-18,2455462,Elizabeth (And Jeff Too),"\"My two kids (6 & 10) stayed with Nancy and her husband for three nights during the week and found them to be lovely hosts, exceeding our expectations for a great Airbnb experience.  They were gracious at all times, very informative about their community and we had a very nice time chatting whenever we found ourselves in the kitchen together.  They engaged the kids in spirited conversation and were very generous with offers of tea, coffee, fruit and cereal for breakfast.  The rooms and bathroom were spotless and fresh and after one day with them, the kids said, \"\"We really love it here mommy - the people are so nice!\"\" \""
1161210,12172180,2014-04-25,9166767,Anna,"Our stay at Nancy’s place was really very great! Nancy has a very nice, very clean, spotless house, our room was very lovely & comfy with clean private bathroom, splendid bed linen. When we arrived Nancy went away to vacation, but we were well aware about it, because Nancy had informed us about her plans beforehand. So we were met by Charles and Jim, Nancy’s downstairs neighbour. They were both very helpful, cordial & friendly. Thanks guys for your help & support. The house is located in a safe, peaceful neighbourhood, but in order to reach it you should be ready to take a bus from metro station. For us it was not a problem, because the bus followed the schedule all the time. Jim provided us with the bus schedule, so we could plan our trip from Boston Downtown to Nancy’s house very punctually. Another good news is: bus stop is two minutes walk away from Nancy’s house.  I can say with confidence it was a very pleasant experience. If I come back in Boston, I will stay here again. I would highly recommend to anyone who visits Boston to stay at Nancy’s place."
1161210,12318727,2014-04-28,7802336,Carissa,"Three of us stayed in this lovely, spacious and clean home. Loved the accommodations (2 spacious bedrooms with comfy beds and a spacious and clean private bathroom with all you could need). Nancy and Muching are very nice. Muching was always prompt and cordial via email and I was able to meet Nancy in person and she is lovely and welcoming."
We did have some difficulty as the hosts were not there when we arrived. Charles (a student staying with them) was in charge. No one was home when we arrived so we went for dinner and returned a few hours later. He didn't have time to prepare the rooms before we got there so we were just asked to wait in the living room. He was very nice and showed us all the amenities as well as told us where to go sight-seeing. However,we then waited 4 hours for the rooms to be prepared. He said he was washing the sheets. Finally,I told him to put the sheets that were dry on my bed (the other bed was ready by that point) so I could go to sleep,and he did. We were passing out on the couches.,,
"The following day Nancy returned home from her trip and everything was great. The day we left she had fresh coffee and breakfast items ready for us on the table. Nancy is a great host and her home is lovely and they have since changed their \"\"instant book\"\" policy to \"\"request to book\"\" so that this doesn't happen again.",,,,,

1161210,13507716,2014-05-29,10209568,Venus,"Our experience staying with 杨老师(Ms.Yang) and her family was very positive. Since we were unfamiliar with Boston's public transportation, she offered to pick us up from the nearest metro station. When we managed to even mess that one up (blame our horrible sense of direction), her son generously came all the way to where we were and drove us home. They also happily shared their kitchen to nurse my dad's culinary itch. On our first night, we watched TV with the family, which was like having a home away from home. There's a wide variety of choices for breakfast, and the rooms were very clean and well-managed. I would recommend them as hosts if you're looking for a quiet, relaxing place a bit outside of the city."

Our bedroom was furnished appropriately and every morning we had everything we needed for breakfast. Our hosts, Junzuo and Nancy were wonderful: they made us feel comfortable and welcome, and we had great conversations. They are so courteous and generous; we were treated like family and I left knowing we had become good friends. They are a great resource for local information and will have you seeing the best attractions and saving money, as Boston streets and parking fees are outrageous. They offered the use of their kitchen but more than that, they even made us dinner a few times! This a large, roomy home, and we were very comfortable. But our hosts were so kind they even woke up at 4 AM to transport us to the airport!  I highly recommend this property and host if you're considering a trip to Boston."

Our hosts went out of their way to ensure we had the best holiday possible. They picked us up at the airport, helped us get transit passes, made sure we had a good breakfast every morning and, because we were the only guests, even let us have a room each despite the fact we had only booked one room. The rooms were clean and spacious, the beds very comfortable and we had a nice sized bathroom to ourselves."
"The location of Nancy and Wan's home made it very easy to access public transit. For $19 we were able to by a seven day \"\"Links\"\" pass which allowed us to ride the bus and the \"\"T\"\" (subway). Since the bus stop is only 2 or 3 minutes walk from the house it was very convenient and we were able to arrive in the heart of Boston in about 45 minutes (one bus ride and one subway ride).",,,,,

It was also very convenient to Logan Airport by bus and subway. I was in Boston to fly in and out of Logan for a trip to Greece. Nancy was kind enough to let us park our car in her driveway while we were gone for a very reasonable price. The room was comfortable and she provided lots of food for breakfast. As a host myself, Nancy and I had some good conversations about airbnb, and I found a very similar style and outlook to my own hosting. The bathroom was spacious and accommodated my two daughters and me as well as a few other guests with no problem. I would definitely recommend Nancy and stay with her again if I happen to be in Boston."

若只是房间的硬件条件好,也许我不至于像此刻这样心怀感恩。在和阿姨与叔叔相处的一周中,最令我感动的是阿姨和叔叔的和善热情。他们处处为我们考量,给予了我们家般的温暖与照顾。美味的家乡菜和细心的关怀,让我这个从未如此远离家乡和父母的留学生竟然没有homesick,因为他们让我觉得

This was a relaxed family atmosphere.   There was fresh fruit and cereal available for us every day.  That was a lovely treat.  We also had use of the coffee maker,plenty of tea,and fresh filtered water.  A real help.,,,
At the time of our stay there were 4-5 residents plus the three of us as guests.  There was only one full bathroom available and it was upstairs.    It was convenient to me since my room was upstairs but my daughter and son in law were downstairs.   Also,their room was heated only by a space heater.  It was quite cold when we were there but nothing like it would have been in the winter.   The room was also used for storing water and supplies so it was cluttered and uninviting.,,,,
The pictures for this home are lovely but the actual situation now is more typical of a busy household.  The bedrooms are crowded with extra futons and stored items.  The public space is a bustle with cooking and business.,,,,,

The house is clean and nice with cooking and laundry facilities. She offered to help my parents with many things - directions, sight-seeing tips, and the breakfast is always great! We highly recommend her and we just want to say thanks!"
1161210,78097243,2016-06-05,57938669,Melanie,"The host was on a business trip during our stay so we only met her husband who was very nice and waited for us to show us around the house even though we arrived late our first day. The rooms and bathrooms were nice and clean. The house is a 30 minute drive from Boston and was a very affordable price for a 4 day, 3 night stay (definitely cheaper than a hotel). We were able to access the fridge, kitchen, and water was available from a cooler. We were able to easily go in and out with own key. For the price, location, and amenities, we had a great stay = )"

4151979,24087285,2014-12-19,21595660,Diane,"This lovely home was perfect for our recent family reunion.  Mary was very flexible and worked w/me to make the timing of arrival easy.  We walked around the area and found delightful boutique shops, grocery, breakfast and dinner options close by.  This home is on a main street in the South Boston area, but we found it to be quiet and comfortable. I would recommend it to another family without a doubt."
4151979,24779431,2015-01-02,24695972,Brian,"This was my first time using AirBNB and Mary was awesome throughout this whole experience.  She made the arrival process very simple and was more than accommodating in making sure we had everything we needed.   The house was absolutely incredible and the pictures do not do it justice!  It is located in the middle of everything from cab stands to breakfast shops to Chinese food to supermarkets, it's got it all.  I couldn't have been happier with this place.  Thanks again Mary!"
4151979,25597866,2015-01-20,24409801,Tom,"This was my first AirBnb experience and it could not have been more perfect. It was impeccably clean, in a great neighborhood complete with nearby grocery stores, pharmacies, specialty food markets, bars, breakfast places, and -- not to mention -- free street parking. Mary was an incredible host, even coming to the house to ensure that we had a place to park as there was a little construction going on outside the day of our arrival. This is an annual trip that normally involves our team of retiring back to cold hotel rooms and waiting in the cold for Ubers only to wait outside in the cold for a restaurant table to open up. To have a home that felt like home was a game changer. There was a huge refrigerator, great oven, beautiful kitchen island, a nice outdoor deck. Plenty of room to come together, plenty of room to retire to your own quarters. To second what other reviewers have said, the pictures don't do it proper justice.  It's five stars all the way."
4151979,25998855,2015-02-01,24597659,Jeanne,"Mary was an excellent hostess, and the space was better than we expected.  Just beautiful. Great South Boston neighborhood, and fun walk across the street to Boston Beer Garden and fantastic quaint italian restaurant.  Will definitely look her up when we head to Boston tradeshow next year."
4151979,27004259,2015-02-23,12034755,Billy,We were very impressed with our family's accommodations for the weekend at Mary and Mike's place in South Boston.  The recently updated condo is beautiful.  Since our purpose for staying in Boston was for an impromptu family reunion.  At one point there may have been 16-18 adults and 8 children enjoying each other's company without any spacial concerns.  I would greatly recommend staying at their place.  Chances are we will be convening again in Boston in the not-so-distant future and I would love to stay there again.
4151979,27776777,2015-03-11,17016540,Jeff,"The apartment was great, great location, very close to the convention center, great neighborhood.  It appeared to be recently remodeled, listing was very accurate; I would stay there again!  Only complaint would be that Mary's wasn't able to respond to inquiries quickly, but the place is so nice, that minor inconvenience was worth it!"

4151979,31395357,2015-05-04,32052226,Darrin,"Mary was a gracious and kind hostess! My friends and I had a fantastic time. The condo was immaculate, spacious, and central to everything we wanted to do in South Boston. We had a minor issue getting into the building so that Mary sent over her husband with a welcome bottle of wine for us and an apology. Totally not necessary but amazingly cool. We'd stay at the condo again in a heartbeat. Loved the place, she was an awesome hostess, and I can't say enough positive things about the overall condo. Thank you Mary!"

4151979,32446557,2015-05-18,5374807,Mike,Beautiful home and easy renting experience - would definitely stay again!
+ I can't stress enough what a beautiful home this is,clearly a lot of time,money,and thought has gone into making it attractive and functional. The house is also very spacious and granted seven adults and two babies more than enough space to live comfortably together over a busy weekend - no easy feat when in-laws are involved.,,
"+ The neighborhood was a pleasant surprise - we didn't know what to expect from \"\"South Boston\"\"",but the neighborhood is packed with families and young professionals,is very close to supermarkets and restaurants,as well as a fantastic park and playground up the hill. Driving access to the rest of Boston was straight forward and downtown was only a few minutes away. Parking was also easier than we anticipated.,,
"+ Mary (the host) was highly responsive to emails and check in was as simple as getting keys out of a lock box. Since the house was so well staged we never had a need to contact her for anything during our stay. An easy and stress-free experience! The rental price we paid was also great value compared to what we would have paid for four hotel rooms during a commencement weekend.\"",,,,,
4151979,32741202,2015-05-21,983859,Terry,"We traveled to Boston for our daughters  2015 graduation from BC.  We stayed in the condo for three nites with my parents, our son, my in-laws and the boy.  The condo was great, bascally brand new, lots of room for everyone, nice kitchen, plenty of bathrooms, on-site laundry, groceries and drug store next door, eating and sports bar options close by, nice location close to the airport and downtown, and easy access to the thru-way, mass transit bus stop just out the front door.  Parking can be a bit tricky  and construction was going on in front of the place when we were there so we needed to be a little resourceful with parking the car.  Thank God the father-in-law had a car big enough for all of us and we only had to park one.    Host was very responsive, overall, met and exceeded all of my expectations."
4151979,32880757,2015-05-23,23531590,Katie,The house was perfect!  It was spacious and very clean. It is in an ideal location to explore the city and connect with busses and trains.  I would highly recommend this house! Mary was an excellent host and very easy to get in touch with before our arrival.  I would definitely stay here again.

4151979,33563680,2015-05-30,24843969,Jennifer,Wonderful experience! Well thought and decorated condo!  Clean and even nicer than the pictures!  The location and condo set up makes it a great place to stay for conventions. I travelled with 3 colleagues and we loved our private bedrooms and bathrooms but also the chance to bond over coffee! The 7 bus is inexpensive and fast to get to the convention center!
4151979,33775180,2015-06-01,24421473,Pamela,"This condo was exactly as advertised.  It was immaculate and beautifully furnished.  It was everything we needed for a family weekend in Boston.  Finding it and gaining entry was simple.  Parking was a bit tricky, but once we figured out that we could leave the car parked on Broadway all weekend and use Uber to get where we needed to go, we were all set!  I would definitely recommend it, and would certainly book it again if I had need to be in Boston.  Thank you, Mary."

4151979,34690729,2015-06-11,3212929,Claude,"This is a really lovely apartment ... VERY spacious, well appointed and comfortable.  Everything one needs for a short or extended stay is here.  My only dislike was the noise ... it was a bit of challenge to sleep with the windows open as there is a nightclub not far away and we found it a bit noisy."
4151979,35571187,2015-06-20,23547267,Hao,Great apartment in a very quiet and convenient location. The apartment was very spacious and all the utilities were new. My family was very happy to stay there.
4151979,35997422,2015-06-24,10347631,Lee,"The apartment is lovely and spacious.  The kitchen is very well stocked and user friendly. We enjoyed the convenience of the nearby shopping and public transportation. Unfortunately, The night life noise from across the street went on until well after midnight and the early morning street noise (trash trucks, buses and cars) was easily heard from the street side bedroom. Unfortunately, there is a very steep flight of stairs to climb to get up to the apartment and yet another steep flight up to 3 of the bedrooms. This created challenges for me and my 3 lady friends because of our various medical conditions (2 artificial knees, an artificial hip and rheumatoid arthritis). Also, hauling our luggage up the steps was quite difficult. The 3 people who used the 2nd floor bedrooms left their bags on the main level and carried their belongings up to their bedrooms as needed. I would recommend that Mary forewarn guests of the many steps so that guests with mobility issues can determine if this lovely apartment is for them."
4151979,36210709,2015-06-26,3076825,Ken,Wonderful place to stay!  Great location.  Easy check in and out.  Will definitely stay again!
4151979,36509742,2015-06-29,27216538,Ben,This place was a perfect fit for our Boston Wedding Weekend.  Four couples fit comfortably in this condo and we still had plenty of room to hang out.  The kitchen was perfect for making big breakfasts and the place was one block away from the grocery store.  There was plenty to do close to the condo that was all within walking distance.  I definitely recommend the Harpoon Brewery and we all walked around Seaport which was another good area with great restaurants and bars.  The juice box up the street was also a nice place that had organic juices and acai bowls which hit the spot after a I highly recommend staying here if you have a big group and are looking to explore Boston.  Mary was a great host and was in contact with us once we arrived and was there if we had any problems.
4151979,37344769,2015-07-06,34611693,Andrea,"The condo was nice and clean, and the neighborhood was close to downtown, about 10 minutes by car, where we spent most of our time. It was also walking distance to a park, bay, a grocery store, pharmacy, a breakfast bagel place, etc. Everything you could ever need is right there and the condo is well stocked in the kitchen too. The two bedrooms facing the street were a bit noisier at night, but it was a 4th of July weekend, so it might be quieter on other weekends. All in all, it was the perfect house for our family to bond, rather than be divided into 4 hotel bedrooms."
4151979,37851604,2015-07-11,32787055,Lorna,"Colleagues and I were in Boston for a 2 day conference held at Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel.  This condo was within easy walking distance with convenient bus and taxi service, also.  The condo was clean, attractive, well-appointed and very convenient to grocery and liquor stores and pubs.  A little noisy on the street side on weekend nights from the pub across the street and bus traffic."
4151979,38809726,2015-07-19,25639050,Cheryl,"A great house for exploring Boston. The beds were very comfortable and there was everything we needed to made our stay very enjoyable. Uber taxi's were used throughout our trip. The supermarket a few doors away was great for all our needs and we tried out a few of the local places to eat. As a light sleeper I found the top bedroom noisy from the pub across the road & the traffic waiting at the lights however, my husband slept through it all. My son who used the ground floor bedroom used ear plugs which worked for him."
"All in all we had a great time & would recommend this apartment as somewhere to stay & enjoy Boston\"",,,,,

We would love to come again and stay longer."
4151979,40318610,2015-07-30,32714134,Kevin,"This is an amazing home, excellent location with all the right amenities. The host is great to work with, always prompt in answering questions. There is everything you want nearby, with groceries dining and even a taxi stand to get you where you need to be. Walking distance to beaches and even back into town with a nice 30 minute easy walk. Couldn't have been more pleased with the overall experience. Highly recommend."
4151979,40898145,2015-08-03,31609347,Christopher,"This is a great home!  The accommodations were very comfortable, and everything was perfect for my stay here.  Finding parking near the condo was easy.  It is in easy walking distance of a many great restaurants and bars.    I thoroughly enjoy my stay here, and highly recommend it."
4151979,41927481,2015-08-10,30870340,Dandi,This is a great home!!  Completely remodeled and so spacious.  We were able to easily fit in the rooms and the living room had plenty of room for all of the family that visited us throughout the stay.  Convenient to all of the sights you might want to see...great local restaurants and a short walk to the beach.   I was told the T was close by the locals although we did not take it.  When we were there we had an issue with the TV/Cable box which the owners quickly took care of right away.  We had the pleasure of meeting Mike (Mary's husband) and he was so gracious and fun to talk to.
There are a lot of stairs so if you are anti-climbing this isn't the place for you.  Also the parking situation was kind of difficult.  Also the noise from the street can be pretty loud on the weekend as there is a bar across the street.  Bring your ear plugs or join the party :),,,,,

This was our family’s first AirBnb experience and it worked out well for our Boston Wedding Weekend! The apartment was very spacious and it was super clean on arrival! It is conveniently located near a grocery store and other amenities. The accommodations were great and we enjoyed the well-stocked kitchen. The apartment appears to have been recently remodeled and is well taken care of. Mary was very flexible with our arrival and departure times and usually got back to us within a day or two. Our family loved the place.,,,,,
The following information is out of the control of the owner and may well be our family’s bad luck but it did impact our stay. We are also reminded that Boston is a big city with lots of city activities!,,,,,
1.Parking got progressively terrible. We felt like the perfect storm hit us! There was street construction right in front of the condo & Monday was street cleaning that required cars to be moved by 5 am and wiped out ½ of the street parking. On this night it took us 30 minutes to find a parking spot for a 2 hour time period then we had to go back out at midnight to try and find another parking spot.,,,,,
2.Street Noise - Again,it seemed like the perfect storm arrived at our door steps. We were awakened every morning (except Sunday) at 7 am by the noise of jack hammers and concrete cutters. Trash trucks,buses and cars passing over the large steel covers serenaded us all night.,,,
3.Night Life noises can be also be an issue as there is a bar directly across the street. For the most part,earplugs helped out except for one night were a bar fight took place out on the sidewalk. My daughters were frightened as you could hearing people yelling that someone had a gun and then they heard popping noises. They thought for sure the crowd would run into our condo. Thank god the police arrived in time to quell the unrest.,,,,

4151979,44316560,2015-08-25,2847903,Hiten,It was a real pleasure staying at mary's apartment at boston. The Apartment was extremely spacious and our group of 8 had an amazing stay. The apartment was immaculate and the location was super-convenient by bus.

Mary and her husband were great hosts and made sure we were in good shape.  It's in the city so you should expect some city noise at night.  It's steps away from anything you'd want with easy access to Boston's sites."

The condo had everything we needed and there was more than enough space for all of us. Mary always answered my questions and was very nice even when we had a mishap in the condo. She was very quick to answer and was excellent. I recommend the location and condo. It has easy access to the supermarket (next door), a few local stores, and public transportation. Thank you for everything Mary!"
4151979,48227641,2015-09-24,9285377,Stephen,Great home. Excellent Boston location. The host (Mary) was very communicative prior to the stay and timely with the delivery of the keys. Mary also gave instructions to and helped all the guests (7 guests) on their particular needs. Everyone had plenty of space and the host was very accommodating with some extra items in order to provide everything that everyone needed.

Prior to our arrival communication was fluid and she made it easy for myself & 3 co-workers to arrive at different times. Once we were all inside the accommodations were  lovely, so so much better than a hotel could ever be! As other reviews have said the condo is located on a busy street so the noise if you are not accustomed to city noise at city hours was loud, but I brought ear plugs, as I always do when I travel, & had no issues! Thanks & we hope to rent again next time business brings us to Boston."
4151979,49587499,2015-10-05,32010447,Kyle,We had a great experience staying at Mary's condo. The condo is extremely well-located in South Boston and very clean. I felt it was a good value for the caliber and size of the space. I would absolutely stay here again.

4151979,50617566,2015-10-13,35394801,Joseph,"The host had any items you might and would need (dishes, paper towels, towels, beds made, shampoo, hair dryer, and more).  There was a binder filled with all the information needed for the house and neighborhood.  There was even a basket with many tourist information to include tours and maps.  Everything was very clean and well taken care of.  The neighborhood was safe, friendly, and convenient.  A grocery store is less than a block away.  A bar is right across the street.  Taxi service is very quick.  There bedrooms had plenty of space and there was enough bathrooms to accommodate our group.  There kitchen was stocked with supplies needed to cook up meals instead of spending money to eat out.  I would stay there again if I was heading to Boston for another trip."

South Boston appeared to be a lovely district and the weather was great for us which meant we could walk into and back from Downtown Boston. If not,the buses were very regular,and the number 7,very quick into town (circa 10 minutes).,,
A supermarket was very close by along with bars and restaurants.,,,,,
Mary was very helpful and always quick to reply.,,,,,

4151979,53603659,2015-11-10,44168383,Martin,"The apartment was clean and located in a nice spot. Bar, liquor store and grocery are in a walk distance. Everything has been as we expected. We were 9 in the condo and it was more than big enough, especially with the 4 restrooms."
Just be careful with the parking: there is no limitation during the weekend,"but Monday morning they will not miss you if you cannot be there!\"",,,,
4151979,53887021,2015-11-14,36463975,Mac,Place was great.  Communication was great with Mary.  Very easy from start to finish.  The place was even better than the pictures.  Very clean with an open floor plan.   I'd highly recommend.
4151979,54134171,2015-11-16,46506351,Kate,Listing description is very accurate although it was a much bigger condo than I even imaged from the pictures. It was very clean and there were plenty of towels.  I was able to enter the condo on my own whenever it was convienent for me. Beautiful place and good location to hang out at night.
4151979,55904676,2015-12-07,45606341,Roy,The place was fantastic.  Celebrating a 50th birthday with friends and family in Boston was a pleasure since we had 'our own place'.  The Condo was perfect and just as described.  Well stocked with all the essentials and a grocery store right next door just in case.  Parking was a little tricky at times - but for the most part - we found a spot right in front.  Truly a great place with tons of room (we had 7).
4151979,57760448,2015-12-29,45624550,Chuxi,"clear and comfortable,nice place for stay"

4151979,58516491,2016-01-03,45023893,Matthieu,"We stayed at the condo for three days, we were 8 people, and it was perfect.  It was, as described, newly renovated, spacious, clean and well located in Boston, at walking distance of all the facilities.  I totally recommend it."
4151979,60120027,2016-01-19,24409801,Tom,"Mary is a wonderful, kind and responsive host. In fact, this was our second time staying at the space. It is spotless and has plenty of room for a large group. It feels like home away from home."
4151979,61748445,2016-02-08,45857106,Ryan,"I had another excellent experience.  There is plenty of room, awesome kitchen, very clean, and great location. There is a reason this wasn't my first time staying here, and will not be my last if I go back to Boston anytime soon!"
4151979,64145184,2016-02-29,13614479,Mike,"We had a wonderful stay for a night out in Boston. The condo is a beautiful and recently renovated 2-story apartment that offers many bars and restaurants within close walking distance, or a short 10-min ride into downtown. Bus service runs right outside the apartment, but there is no T-stop nearby, so expect to rely on buses, Uber, or driving to get out of South Boston.  Parking on the weekend was not nearly as tough as other reviewers described, and we got a spot directly in front of the building. The host is very responsive and happy to offer advice and suggestions if needed. Highly recommended."
4151979,64997950,2016-03-10,30713614,Richard,"Stayed at the condo for an event at the Boston Convention Center, it was the perfect location to house myself and my staff. The house was clean and there was plenty of room. Mary was very responsive and I felt taken care of from before the stay until the end. I would definitely recommend the condo and will stay there again if the opportunity arises."
4151979,66283163,2016-03-20,57267321,Kevin,Mary's house is amazing. We had a great St. Patrick's Day weekend in South Boston and the location couldn't have been more perfect. Mary was great communicating with us throughout the weekend and the whole process was a breeze. The downstairs neighbors are awesome too! A great stay.
4151979,67274040,2016-03-27,16152866,Naomi,Mary's space was beautiful--just like the pictures! Her listing was spacious and all of the little details were taken care of; she made check in seamless! This is a great spot to stay at if you are visiting Boston for a convention and a short uber ride from main streets like Charles st. and Newbury.

4151979,67867390,2016-04-01,1386197,Beth,"This was a repeat visit to Mary's 4 bedroom condo in South Boston.  As before, the house was in tip top shape upon our arrival and Mary and her husband went out of their way to ensure a comfortable stay."
4151979,68864398,2016-04-07,17717718,Stacia,Mary's condo was a fantastic base for our family's great week sight-seeing in Boston. The location was great--right next to a market and restaurants.
4151979,69453982,2016-04-11,11279796,Alex,"A great place! This was our second trip to the condo. Nicely furnished, clean, and a great space for hanging out."
4151979,70633002,2016-04-19,53301892,Rosemary,"Mary had everything set up for us from water in the refrigerator to fruit on the table. She also had a binder with instructions, and information about Boston. The apartment was beautifully decorated, with every amenity you could think of. We could not have done better at a 5 star hotel!"
The neighborhood was lively with a grocery store less than a block away,a Rite-Aid across the street,a cab stand down the street,and a bus stop on the corner. It was wonderful.,,

4151979,71404836,2016-04-25,26609548,Ben,"Very spacious place, great location. Places that can comfortable accommodate large groups are not easy to find, this place is a gem! Will look to book again for our next trip. Mary was great in terms of communication. If you need weekday parking, that can be a challenge, but Mary was upfront on the restrictions in the area."
4151979,72743342,2016-05-04,3751497,Lindsay,"Mary's place was absolutely wonderful. It is exactly as described. It was immaculately clean with not a dust bunny to be found. The location is great - in a good neighborhood with restaurants, near a grocery store and pharmacy. There is a cab stand right down the block, which makes it very convenient to get anywhere in the city. It was the perfect place for me and my coworkers to stay while attending an event in Boston."
4151979,73809746,2016-05-10,5529156,Maggie,"Our family was in Boston to celebrate 2 birthdays, Mother's Day and a graduation and anything we needed was available in the well stocked house, or at the Stop & Shop or RiteAid half a block away. We never met Mary in person but her communication prior to arrival was so welcoming it set the stage for the trip. The place was beautifully decorated, very comfortable and spacious as described."
As previously mentioned in reviews,"the bar across the street had lively patrons exiting at closing time but the activity only lasted about 45 minutes.  \"",,,,

We came in for our daughter's graduation.....family came from all over the country and it was great to sit and visit and not have to deal with hotel rooms!  This home is beautiful!!!  Mary was available and willing to help if we needed anything!  Hope you stay here....you will be so glad you did!  By the way....everyone commented on how wonderful the mattresses were!  We all slept so well!!\""
4151979,75070124,2016-05-18,60667969,Dan,"Perfect Place! Very clean, very nice. Excellent beds, appliances, bathrooms. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat! Grocery & Liquor store 1 minute walk away. Uber/taxi's were easily to get - return. We had a conference at the Boston Convention Center & it was close, even walked a couple of times. Why a cramped hotel room when you could have this spacious place for nearly the same price."
4151979,76668192,2016-05-28,26072244,Robert,The condo was immaculate; the space had a great flow that allowed everyone time together and alone if needed.  It was everything that was promised in the listing.  Thank you.
4151979,76798228,2016-05-29,51541004,Molly,We had a great time at Mary's place. It was a perfect location to act as our homebase for our girlfriend who was visiting for a pre wedding weekend. Everything was exactly as advertised and we are already thinking about another weekend sometime next year!
4151979,78760395,2016-06-09,61721290,Joshua,Great place to stay. Very clean. Makes you feel very welcome and it is near a lot of great places to eat and explore!
4151979,79696024,2016-06-13,1640597,Gino,"Mary's house was amazing. Very spacious, clean and in a great location. Mary was easy to reach and answer any questions. We were there for the Copa America games and got to spend time in and around Boston. Will definitely be back to Mary's house when visiting Boston."
4151979,80780943,2016-06-19,8037246,Ashley,Perfect home for a weekend with friends!  Everything involved with the rental went smoothly—from getting into the apartment to check out and everything in between.  The space is even prettier in real life.  It's very spacious and close to everything we wanted to do in Southie.  Highly recommend!
4151979,82697852,2016-06-28,67619795,David,"What a fantastic experience.  Seven in our group and we all had space and the opportunity to be together at the same time.  Clean, roomy, great location, outstanding services nearby--everything we could have hoped for.  Mary was wonderful and accommodating--the perfect hostess!  This was our first Airbnb experience and if they're all like this, it's a winner!"
4151979,83951338,2016-07-04,33500848,Jeremy,"I stayed here with a group of my classmates and we couldn't have asked for a better place! We were in town for a convention and picked Mary's home because it was nearby. The location was perfect, with tons of great restaurants and bars within walking distance, and a grocery store just a few steps away. The house was even nicer than we expected from the pictures, and it comfortably fit all 8 of us. (We could have probably fit 3-4 more between the air mattress and couches.) There are four full bathrooms and four bedrooms, which I didn't think was possible in a Boston home. None of us wanted to leave at the end of the trip, and we'd definitely stay here again!"
4151979,85482264,2016-07-11,13810263,Elisabeth,"Séjour en famille parents, enfants et petit enfant à l'occasion d'une fête de famille. Le logement était parfait! situé à 10 minutes à pied de la plage, transport en commun pratique et efficace vers le centre de Boston. Nous y avons apprécié l'espace dans la maison et l'équipement complet et impeccable mis à disposition. Toutes les petites choses dont on peut avoir besoin étaient mises à disposition. Et pour le reste, les magasins sont vraiment au bas de la maison. C'était très agréable."
L'hotesse nous a aussi bien aidés en répondant très rapidement à nos soucis.,,,,,
Si l'occasion se reproduit,nous serions les premiers à y retourner.,,,,

4151979,88550567,2016-07-24,52700850,Heather,We stayed at Mary's place over the weekend and could not have asked for better accommodations! The home was immaculate when we arrived and the space was perfect for the 7 of us that stayed; we all had our own room and wonderful to space to gather in. Mary was very easy to communicate with and very accessible. I appreciate her flexibility in allowing us to drop our bags off early which allowed us to explore the city much easier! There is a Stop N Shop about 3 houses down and a Rite Aid across the street. There are a few restaurants in the area and it was very easy to Uber it from the location. If we ever came back to Boston I would hope that we would be able to stay at Mary's again!!
4151979,89605903,2016-07-29,6128151,Anja,"Marys Appartement is clean and beautiful. 4 bedrooms with doublebeds and 4 nice, clean bathrooms. The Kitchen has everything you might need. Nice and safe neighbourhood, supermarket, drugstore, small shops and Restaurants just around the corner. Mary was always very helpful and we had a great time. I can recommend her Appartement to anybody and would definitly stay there again. It felt like a home away from home. Thanks Mary!"
4151979,90914219,2016-08-02,63964253,Kathleen,"Mary was a great hostess!   She was very prompt in answering my questions and recommending how to get around Boston, left a bowl of fruit and a carton of milk.  The kitchen was well equipped and plenty of towels, washcloths, blankets, etc.  The house is upstairs and is beautiful!  It looks brand new and is very clean and indeed spacious!  We had 9 of us and used an air mattress we found in a huge closet that served as a bedroom for one of us.  One night my brother and his wife also joined us and there was enough bedding for them to use the couches.  It is on a main street in South Boston, so it was a bit noisier than in a suburb. If you're a light sleeper, ear plugs could come in handy.  However, the convenience of a grocery next door, the bus line across the street, food places all around and the beach in walking distance made it a perfect place for us.  We didn't need to catch our flight till late afternoon so Mary welcomed us to stay beyond check out time so we didn't have to deal with luggage to do some last minute sight seeing.  We did not rent a car because public transportation and uber were so accessible.  I would definitely recommend this awesome home!"
4151979,94306039,2016-08-15,8127501,Hawngen,"The place was most capacious and was stocked with a variety of accouterments to make anyone feel at home.

The room was clean and the surrounding neighborhood had character. Only downsides were no air conditioning (normally not a problem, but I visited during a heat wave) and you have to provide your own towel for the bathroom. Overall, a great experience for the price."

Unfortunatly we couldny meet as she was out of town during my stay. The room mate living there welcomed me in and showed my around the apartment. Room was a good size just as described. Very easy to walk into the center of boston ~20 mins, even less on the subway. I would stay here again if i was visiting boston again. Well worth the money."

12183851,70691510,2016-04-19,65064836,Sally,"Good location, very close to Hynes and Copley station. The room is enough for young travelers who may be traveling on budget and want to have a place to rest. May not be suitable for someone expecting a hotel-level accommodation. The host Eli is friendly and easy-going, her roommates are nice, too. You don't have to worry if you are disturbing, just be yourself."
12183851,71152362,2016-04-24,16664377,Dorian,Eli is a really great student host! Her place is in an amazing location across the street from Berklee. Her room is really basic to bare with only a twin mattress on the floor (no bed frame) and just a lamp but it's great for a crash pad for the night.
12183851,71701155,2016-04-27,23919692,Melanie,"This listing was exactly as described, small private room. Eli was a great host, greeted me and was super flexible. I arrived a little later than expected and she was still able to accommodate me. GREAT location with lots of food options nearby. I would highly recommend staying Eli!"
12183851,71948734,2016-04-30,66129562,H,"You can't beat the price and location.  However, I wasn't pleased with the cleanliness of the bathroom or that the windows had no curtains or blinds (no privacy and sun shines brightly through). If you're up for a college environment, then it may work for you. Eli and roommates were very nice and welcoming, but I honestly can't say I would stay here again."

I had a private room with a comfortable bed as listed. I was able to leave in and out with ease. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. Great location! Walking distance to Fenway Park, Wholefoods, restaurants, pubs, and the train. Thank you again! :)"
12183851,76417871,2016-05-27,1110918,Pierre B.,"Eli was a great host willing to help, even if it was not perfect far from it.  The room is tiny and frugal in terms of equipment, but perfect if you just need to drop your stuff and attend other things or stroll around.  Parking is expensive, especially when there is a Red Sox game, as the apartment is located near Fenway Park.  Ideal for those who head to Back Bay, Fenway, Museum of Fine arts for instance."

However I wouldn't stay there again. It was hot,no AC. And I went in June. Also it was not clean. Bathroom had a big roach on the floor just laying dead on its back. The shower was gross. Wish I had my sandals with me for the shower. The couch in the bedroom was dusty. I guess the bed was decent? I had to get the sheets out of the closet,so who knows if they were really clean from the person who used them the night before.  Long story short,"my friend bailed me out and I stayed at his place overnight. \"",,

The host is friendly and provides us with resources we need. Everything is so great that I feel I need to recommend this apartment to my friend, except the bed. It's an air bed, comfortable for one person, but not good for two people. Therefore, book this apartment if you are traveling alone; but if you are traveling with friend, think twice before booking."

The apt is at a very good location, less than 3 min walk to red and orange lines, which made our trip in Boston super convenient. It is also a safe area, and to us, it's not that noisy at night. We had a really good time staying there."

8441187,77756894,2016-06-03,66239954,Ji,"The host and his girlfriend were both very nice and respectful of our privacy. They responded to our messages very quickly. The apt is in an excellent location, close to everything. It was our first time visiting Boston and we were able to enjoy and explore Boston conveniently. The Red and Orange Metro Lines, shopping, restaurants, grocery and convenience stores are just around the corner a few steps away. Boston Common, Freedom Trail are only a minute walk from the apt. The main entry to the building is secure, the living room is bright with lots of light in the day and the outside noise was not too bad at night at all."
8441187,78479413,2016-06-07,28307036,Craig,Xiongfei went out of his way to make us feel welcome and comfortable in his home. We couldn't have asked for a better location to explore Boston. It was so close to everything that we wanted to see. Thanks for the experience.
8441187,78672112,2016-06-08,19319140,Peter,Great place in downtown Boston. Right next to subway station.

8441187,79889188,2016-06-14,14556266,Simone,Very accurate listing description with a straightforward and easy experience. Loved the apartment and how bright and accessible it was from Downtown Boston and from Logan Airport.
8441187,80128506,2016-06-16,52049288,Rajesh,"Xiongfei and his partner were fantastic! Prior to my arrival, he constantly kept in touch to determine what time I would arrive so he could avail himself. He was very patient despite me being delayed due to Amtrak delays. The location is second to none and after midnight, there is no noise so I had a very good rest. The airbed is very comfortable and the hosts accorded me a lot of privacy so despite staying in their living room, it was as good as having my own room."
8441187,81314359,2016-06-22,5784960,Kiky,"Shawn and Rose are very nice and tried their best to keep your privacy and comfort during your stay. The location is awesome! You can reach green/orange line in less than 1 min and the blue line in 3 mins. Many tourists' favorite destinations are in walking distance and it's easy to get late night meals in Chinatown, which is also in 10 mins walking distance. However, if you need a really quiet space to sleep, it's better to find some other places. Otherwise, I'll recommend this place for backpackers for its great hosts, unbeatable price and awesome location."
8441187,82043052,2016-06-26,54866404,Xiaoyu,A nice and convenient place! The host is very kind and hospitable. I want to come back again.

13002808,75804450,2016-05-23,16645584,Yesai,"Probably one of the best airbnb experiences I've had. Maani was extremely friendly and attentive. The apartment was clean, organized, and comfortable. This was much better than a hotel. The apartment is located in a prime spot with the T being down the street and tons of restueants, shops, and groceries stores within 5 minutes of walking. We would definitely stay here again, it was a pleasure. I would highly recommend this listing."
13002808,79268349,2016-06-12,28988940,Sean,"Let me just start off by saying that this was truly one of the most comfortable Airbnb experiences I've had so far. Maani was incredibly welcoming from the start. The room was exactly as pictured, and everything was properly cleaned. The neighborhood itself is very friendly; not to mention, it takes less than a minute to walk over to a Starbucks or the T (which is a huge plus). Will definitely try to book a room here again should I ever return to Boston."
13002808,80957008,2016-06-20,145679,William,"Maani was really welcoming, and always available. The flat and the room is very clean and tidy, and convenient for the T into Boston. Great location, recommended."

13002808,86709314,2016-07-17,29079610,Jantima,We had a great time staying with Maani! The area was great for exploring and a short walk to the T. Maani was very accessible and made our stay comfortable.
13002808,88083560,2016-07-23,47097174,Shauna-Kaye,"Maani was  awesome and very hospitable by answering our questions.  We woke up early each morning, but Maani didn't mind. His place is close to the T and Boston is easy to travel around so it's awesome that his place was not in the city."
13002808,88952982,2016-07-26,24075323,Inge,I would definitely recommend staying at Maani's when you visit Boston. The room is very clean and bright and also are the bathroom and kitchen. Maani is around but very discrete.. and will answer all your questions. You can get a healthy breakfast at the organic supermarket that is really close!
13002808,89750481,2016-07-29,6424986,Poni,Maani was a phenomenal host who made my stay in Boston very enjoyable! The apartment was very clean and the private bedroom surpassed all of my expectations. I highly recommend booking with Maani.
13002808,90590074,2016-08-01,31247009,Meli,"We stayed at Maani's House for 3 days, in the end of July 29 to 31. The house was very clean and the room was bright and if . Also the location of house was very easy to reach by any time  (from 5 A.M to 1 A.M) – T train (green line) and buses run very close to his house. You can get a healthy breakfast at the organic supermarket that is really close!"
"So his place was exactly as it advertised and I would definitely stay with him again in the future and I recommend everybody staying at Maani's when you visit Boston.\"",,,,,

The Wifi is very fast and reliable. The house is in a perfect location - just a 2 min walk to Centre St, and 5-6 min walk to the Green St T."
667325,32699436,2015-05-20,31352753,Shannon,"The neighborhood was very cute and walking distance to the T line. Lots of fun shopping and restaurants in the area. Also, the bedroom was large and spacious for myself and two teens to spend the week. Everything was great!"
667325,33268566,2015-05-26,30105120,Janelle,"My brother and I recently stayed at Maura's place over the Memorial Day weekend, and it was lovely! The room is a great room, very spacious, and with a private bathroom down the hall. We also had access to the kitchen. Her home is beautiful with a lot of history. The front porch was a great place to sit and chill, and that is what we did. The neighborhood is quiet and filled with old beautiful homes. Everyone I showed a picture to was quite jealous and thought it was lovely, wishing they could go. Her place is a block from the bus, and about 5 to 10 minutes from transit. A great place for breakfast sandwiches is City Feed down the street, and of course Dunkin Donuts! Maura has tons of knowledge about the town of JP and all of Boston, with tons of suggestions for places to go. She is easy to communicate with and all in all we couldn't of done our trip any better had we not stayed with her. We felt welcome, and very comfortable! Thank you Maura for having my brother and I. We will be back!"
667325,33687837,2015-05-31,31794563,Wendy,"The host and her mother made me feel very welcome. The very diverse neighborhood is quite beautiful and is full of exquisite older homes. The main street has many restaurants and shops so it was easy to get a meal, etc. The bus connection into town was also very good and convenient. I felt safe walking from the bus stop to the house at night. The area is quite a gem!"
667325,34218154,2015-06-06,17843769,John,This was the perfect spot for my business trip. Short walk to the train. Very clean and spacious bedroom and nice bathroom. I really liked the quiet space to study as well. Maura was a great host. I will definitely try to stay here again for future visits to Boston.
667325,34708607,2015-06-11,824853,Eliot,"Host very friendly, great neighborhood with nearby restaurants, comfortable room although no air conditioning."

667325,35230344,2015-06-16,31849274,Ellen,"Maura was very accommodating. My mom and I were worn out and just stayed in the room and hung out and she made sure we were comfortable. She also gave us some tips of where to go. Overall, a great stay and really easy to get to and from subway."
667325,35476288,2015-06-19,33318795,Debbie,"What a great location in Jamaica Plain, loved waking up listening to the birds singing. The room was large and comfy, wifi available, and it felt safe. I would definitely return."

667325,36193716,2015-06-26,33612069,Terri,Maura was quick to respond to my questions and continued to be helpful throughout our stay. We enjoyed visiting with her family.
Her place was on a quiet side street,but near to great restaurants and shops.  The train stop was about 10 minutes away through the residential area.  Parking for our van was available on another nearby street.,,,,
The room was very spacious and the private bath was right down the hall.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
667325,36402161,2015-06-28,33442476,Carrie,"The location was fantastic.  1.5 short blocks to Centre Street with great small stores and a Dunkin' Donuts, of course.  My family was staying at Taylor House and this was a short walk away -- the Pond and Arboretum are both within walking distance.  I didn't take the train, but I understand that's close too.  The bed was very comfortable, the coffee great, and Maura, her daughters, and the dog were super nice.  I highly recommend this room."
667325,36816258,2015-07-01,35913307,Danielle,"Maura was incredibly welcoming! We got stuck in horrible traffic on our arrival day and Maura was very understanding and flexible when we arrived very late at night. The house is exactly as advertised, so much privacy and the room is very large and well equipped with amentaties. The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful. We throughly enjoyed our stay, thank you so much Maura!"
667325,37169328,2015-07-05,3054878,Puett,Maura was very friendly and helpful. Her house is very cool and classic New England style. House was very clean and comfortable.

667325,37675974,2015-07-09,22985439,Lia,"We really liked staying with Maura! She was flexible with arriving times, and the space was very comfortable. The neighborhood is very cute and easily accessible by T train from the center of boston. The room was big and clean, and offered enough place for the three of us - you could even add another person. Thank you Maura for providing us with the fans to keep the room cool with such hot weather! Your dog is also adorable :)"
667325,42667817,2015-08-15,21743845,Katherine,"I stayed at Maura's home for 5 weeks while I worked in Boston. I felt right at home in her lovely space. Her place is very homey, and the neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. The room was spacious and had more furniture than I even needed - so it was very easy to move my things in. My brother came to visit for a weekend and he was comfortable and happy on the futon. The location is fantastic!  It has all the great things Boston has to offer - good food, multiple Dunkin' Donuts, and the gorgeous Jamaica Pond - but it's also very neighborhood-y and authentic. Maura's home is just 1 block away from the major thoroughfare, but her street is quiet, so I slept well here! She provided fans, which kept me cool at night, and I really appreciated the fridge in the room. She was kind and responsive to any questions/needs I had. Overall, it was a nice place to hang my hat everyday."
667325,46579384,2015-09-12,949297,Matthew C.,"This was probably our best experience so far staying with AirBnB. Maura is a wonderful person and welcomed us into her home. The neighborhood is great, with restaurants and shopping within a few minutes' walk."
667325,47968139,2015-09-22,34148845,Sharon,We went to Boston for our daughters White Coat ceremony. We found the room to be clean and spacious. It is located in a beautiful historic neighborhood. There is a nice park/pond a short walk  away with a 1.5 mile paved path that we would run on in the morning. Since most of our time was spent in the Back Bay Area we were not here much other than sleeping at night.  Due to our busy schedule we never had the opportunity to meet Maura. She did however keep in touch via next to make sure our needs were met. Thanks Maura.
667325,48579884,2015-09-27,2031869,Frédéric,As described by Maura.
Her house is ideally placed in a great neighbourhood,not far from the subway and not far from a commercial street (but far enough to avoid disturbances).,,,,
The room is more than big enough for 3 people.,,,,,
"We spend a great time there.\"",,,,,
667325,49245046,2015-10-02,40899744,Thu,"It was a wonderful stay! We met Maura when we arrive, very friendly and helpful. The house is in a very nice neighborhood, a little distant from boston center but not much of a problem since the ride to the house is enjoyable. The room makes us feel like home with a mixture of modern and antique design, beds are super comfy. Kitchen and bathroom are clean, convenient. Excellent choice of mine to stay there!"
667325,49491539,2015-10-04,43771155,Jitka,We had a pretty nice stay here.  The house was not modern but it was clean.

I didn't have the opportunity to meet Maura, but the house was quiet and the room was fantastic. It was what it looked like, and beautiful and spacious! Plenty of cabinets and storage space. There is even a mini fridge and a desk with Boston tour guide books and a futon. The neighborhood seemed safe and was beautiful in my opinion. the location is only a short walk to the T stop and we had no problems. She was always reachable if we needed her. I would definitely stay here again if i were to visit Boston again!"
667325,50100331,2015-10-09,44151412,Joe,"When I can, I stay at Airbnb locations for business travel to escape the generic hotel experience and get a feel for true neighborhoods. This comfortable stay did not disappoint--around the corner from the village center of Jamaica Plain and an easy walk to the Green St stop on the Orange T, about 15 minutes from Downtown Crossing. Will stay here again."
667325,50481375,2015-10-12,43435133,Jeanpiere,"I stayed there two nights. I didn't have the opportunity to meet Maura, but she was always available via text message. The room was organized and spacious just as the picture shows.

I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone that needs a place to stay."
667325,51145327,2015-10-18,43455363,Brenda,"My parents and I stayed for four nights. Everything was perfect, such a nice house (the room was perfect for the three of us) and family, even though we barely saw either Maura or her daughters, but they certainly received us very well."
"Lovely neighborhood and house.\"",,,,,
667325,52071981,2015-10-26,37443228,Susan,"Maura's house a classic old home in the Jamaica Plain area of Boston. It is in a beautiful neighborhood literally right around the corner from public transportation, restaurants, coffee shops and other stores. Our room was clean and had more than enough space for 3 people. We had our own bathroom to use and the kitchen was right down the hall. She respected our privacy but let us know we could contact her with anything we needed. I think this might just be the best deal in Boston!"
667325,52406412,2015-10-29,43641474,Paul,Maura was very nice and easy to get in contact with. She made sure that I had everything I needed. Her house is charming and well kept. The subway is only 5-7 minutes walking with a number of restaurants nearby. Great experience! Thank you.
667325,52837340,2015-11-02,27117672,Lauren,Maura and her home were lovely. It's a pity we only got to meet her once but we were so busy running around that our paths just didn't cross much. The room was very spacious and clean and there was a second cot to sleep on. We had a great time and definitely recommend this listing!
667325,53183929,2015-11-06,12936453,Lauren,"Just what we needed for two quick nights in Boston. Bright and roomy, private bathroom a big plus. Easy walking distance to neighborhood parks and eateries and the Green Street T. Maura was easy to work with: accessible when we needed her and invisible when we didn't. Great stay!"
667325,53607566,2015-11-10,28018658,Daniela,"Maura was very nice, welcoming, and hospitable the moment we got to her house. She made things easy for us, we had an incredible room and we had a wonderful stay. We strongly recommend staying here!"
667325,53903469,2015-11-14,47096003,Deborah,This was the first time my husband and I used Air B&B and we were very happy with our stay at Maura's house. We had our own private room and bathroom that had everything we needed for our visit. The room had plenty of space for 3 people and the fridge was an added bonus to store drinks and small breakfast items. The neighborhood was located in the perfect part of town because the main street had stores and restaurants that were a short walk from the house and the subway was a nice walk of about 6 minutes through a residential neighborhood. Maura was accommodating and met us upon our arrival. She made herself available to us if we needed her but also gave us privacy. She even gave us passes to a beautiful museum which we were able to enjoy on our last day in Boston. We will certainly return to stay with Maura the next time we are in Boston. Thank you Maura!!!
667325,54852311,2015-11-25,43818997,Josh,"Staying at Maura's for a week was definitely a pleasurable experience.  The neighborhood is very nice, tucked away in Jamaica Plain, close to a trendy street of knick knack shops, local cuisine, and a fire station that puts mustaches on their vehicles.  The room is very spacious and uplifting, the cats and dog are friendly, and the kitchen was great too!  My girlfriend Masha and I stayed in Boston to attend an international career fair at the Boston Convention Center.  At the price we paid, this AirBNB was a steal!"
Maura is also extremely nice and approachable.  Every time we needed any information about the area or random help (like when I needed to use a printer),she was there to provide.  At the same time,she respected our privacy,"as we had the entire second floor to ourselves most of the time when we were there.  I highly recommend Maura's AirBNB offering.  5/5\"",,

667325,62060248,2016-02-11,36237140,Beth,"I stayed at Maura's house for 5 weeks during a rotation for PA school. The room was clean and comfortable and the mini fridge was a great perk! Maura is very sweet and even though our paths didn't cross much, it was always nice to talk to her or her mother. The only con was that parking could be tricky after 7pm but that's to be expected in any city. I would definitely stay here again!"
667325,66495773,2016-03-22,41846794,Laura,"I loved staying at Maura's home! She is so welcoming, always willing to help and just a person you like being around with.

667325,67681658,2016-03-30,40631705,Luca,"We stayed in Maura's room in three persons just for one night, but we really enjoyed our experience. The house is conveniently located at a walking distance from the T orange line subway, and near a street with plenty of bars and restaurants. The room itself was cozy and comfortable, and the host was very kind in meeting our needs for check-in and check-out time."

667325,76448062,2016-05-27,2630077,Kimber,This was a great place to stay. The host was kind and very responsive. I was able to get all the information I needed about my stay despite having issues with my Airbnb account. The from easily fit me and my 3 friends comfortably and everything we needed was there and ready when we arrived. The only little hiccup we had was how hot it was! Boston was crazy hot the two days we stayed here and the AC wasn't on yet. Maura was prepared though and brought us two fans for the room which made it much better but still a little warm. She also offered to change the sheets to thinner ones so we wouldn't be so toasty. Overall this was a great place and I would definitely stay again.
667325,77395197,2016-05-31,23035593,Constant,Maura's house was great. The location in JP is right off Center Street and a short walk to the T.  The room is large and comfortable and she was was very friendly and accommodating.  I would stay here again.

On arrival Maura was welcoming and informative. It is a really lovely room which was spacious and airy and has all your needs sorted. Big comfortable bed. The house is located in a really nice neighbourhood. It is a short walk to the train station but also a good bus route. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend
667325,90243930,2016-07-31,59988532,Sonya,"\"Maura made us feel welcome even before we arrived with elaborate responses both verbally and in emails to my questions and concerns. Upon arrival all was tidy and clean! Right from the beginning, Maura's warm personality and open, honest conversation always made me feel at home! Whenever I had a question or need, she was quick to provide answers, resources as she is very knowledgable about her lovely community and the city of Boston! Maura made me feel like a friend, which was quite a treat as I was there for 40 days and new to the area. Despite her challenging schedule, Maura made time for me as we were able to enjoy a couple of delicious meals together with lively conversation in her beautiful shaded backyard!  She also respected our space, but made sure our needs were met. For example...when I had my good friend and daughter were to arrive as guests, she made sure there was bedding and towels way in advance and even offered to make the futon though I was willing and able as she has a challenging academic (URL HIDDEN) daughter and I felt very welcome and comfortable in this beautiful home and live, hip neighborhood. We enjoyed the largest fresh water pond in Boston...Jamaica Pond biking around with sailing and rowboats to rent if you wish. The restaurants we experienced in Jamaica Plain were authentic and tasty! There is also a few yummy bakeries and coffee shops with unique treats!  Both the bike path along the South Corridor and the \"\"T\"\" made for an easy and pleasurable commute to the most historical and glorious big city I have ever visited! I couldn't have asked for a more memorable and joy-filled experience in Boston! I truly hope Maura and her family will stay in touch and come to visit us in Oregon one day soon"
667325,93719016,2016-08-13,34420344,Juergen,"My son and myself spent 10 nights there. It was a great experience for us, since everything worked out fine.

She allowed us to check in early, provided us with suggestions for attractions and restaurants, and offered to take us to the airport when we left.  When I asked about decaf coffee she went out and bought some.  You cannot beat the service.  The location was perfect, just 1-2 blocks from restaurants and a short walk to the train to go to the center of the city."

Fantastic communication and even texted in the morning to make sure we had moved my friends car to not get towed. There was some construction noise in the morning, but he even texted apologizing because he didn't know it was planned."
The location is great with easy access to transportation and a nice walk to parks. The room is spacious and comfortable. The only thing I would say is that if you're looking for a hotel feel and prestine cleanliness,"this isn't the place. \"",,,,
10117803,63084991,2016-02-20,22535296,Matt,"Thank you Kara. Great apartment with lots of space and modern appliances. Very comfortable beds, wifi worked well for all four of us and the welcome kits were a fabulous touch. Lovely building too with friendly, helpful staff. Pool was clean and large, although quite cold. At under four feet deep I guess its perfect for lap training. The gym looked very well stocked. Views were good and the location was perfect, right in the heart of theatre land, China Town, shopping, restaurants and travel."
10117803,80421806,2016-06-18,73072614,Brock,"Apt was fine what I expected as far as amenities.  Don't expect to get more than one room key.  I requested it upon entry and three days later after calling 6 times they still didn't show up with an extra key.  My business partner and I had to share throughout the week, definitely not ideal."
4765070,24697969,2015-01-01,6943545,Cmpetilla,"Miriam and her husband were fantastic.  We got into town much later than expected, but they were more than happy to accommodate us and were incredibly friendly.  The studio was very cozy and complete.  (Since we were traveling with our toddler, they even put milk and other staples in the fridge for us.)  The studio had been decorated with a lot of love and was super super clean.  The appliances (stove, blender, tv, etc) and bathroom fixtures were all new. And there was good wifi.  We didn't need to know much about the area since we used to live there, but Miriam struck me as the type of person that would have happily made recommendations if necessary.  I highly recommend her studio."

I happened to be in Boston during the bad winter storms and right before another one hit, she brought me some basic food in order to make sure I would make it through the night. On the first night she also brought me a home cooked dinner, which was a pleasant surprise and a nice way to make me feel at home."

She responded very quickly to my request and any emails. When we arrived Miriam took the time to show us all the amenities in the studio. She also had set out fruit, chocolates, bagels and cream cheese, coffee/tea, an assortment of water, toothpaste and mouthwash, even laundry detergent for us to use.  It was such a nice surprise and a welcome change as we'd been traveling for 2 weeks already and we're getting tired."
My husband and I were traveling with our 6 month old son and the studio was a perfect fit for our little family or a couple checking out Boston.  The studio was quiet,the wifi was fast,and water pressure in the shower was amazing.   We had everything we needed if we wanted to cook,but there are so many great restaurants in the neighborhood that we ate out most of the time.,,
Jamaica Plain is great if you don't want to stay in the downtown. It's super easy to take the subway everywhere,even from the airport. You can spend your days downtown,have a great dinner out in JP,then wander home with a full belly. There are great coffee shops,bakeries,ice cream

Host had even put some food in the kitchen for us, as well as leaving some chocolates on our dresser!  We did not meet host in person, possibly because I had told her that we were looking for privacy.  We were able to park right outside our apartment, which was really nice.

The area is very pleasant with local shops and restaurants within walking distance. Only a short walk to Jackson Square T or buses on the high street. If you have a car there is off road parking. It was also quiet and set back from the street. We will definitely return of our son stays in Boston.

We really appreciated th­e air conditioner, and the new stove and­ fridge. In the evenings we relaxed on t­he back porch, which we considered our e­xtended living space. Jamaica Plain is a­ very nice area. We felt very safe in th­e neighbourhood and there are many nearb­y retail stores, restaurants, pubs, etc.­ Public transportation service is conven­ient: bus at the top of the street and a­ 10 minute walk to the subway (buy a wee­kly pass)."

My only issue was that the agreed check-in time was 2:00 pm and no one was there at the time. We called,texted,messaged,and e-mailed them and received no response.  It was a little unnerving,but everything worked out fine when they showed up 15 minutes later.,

4765070,38276628,2015-07-14,28097776,Rachel,"Miriam’s place was great! Her brother kindly welcomed us and showed us around the apartment, which is cozy and feels just like home. It had everything you’d need for a comfortable stay, including a little kitchen with a coffee maker, and an AC. The bathroom was SO clean, and it was nice they had extra shampoo/conditioner for us light packers. All in all, a well-stocked place. They even bought bagels and orange juice for us!"
Jamaica Plain is a great location outside the craziness of downtown Boston. The T is definitely within a short walking distance away,as are cute restaurants,including a Scottish pub nearby.,,,
The separate entrance was the nicest feature of the place,because it allowed us to come back after a late dinner quietly without disturbing the family that lives next door/upstairs.,,,,
"I will recommend my family to stay here when they're in town!\"",,,,,
4765070,38489774,2015-07-16,5631925,Kathie,"The accommodation was very clean, and had everything we needed. It was centrally located to be easy access to the T which we made good use of. The air conditioning was wonderful on the hot days we were there. It was convenient having Miriam living across the road as well. There were nice touches like slippers, and toothpaste and shampoo. My husband loved having coffee on the deck each morning. We found Miriam to be a very understanding host, and can recommend her accommodation to  all."
4765070,38987903,2015-07-20,30119568,Alexander,A very warm welcome and introduction to the apartment which was exactly as described - with some extras.
The fridge was stocked with cold water,bagels and some cream cheese as well as some fruit,a really nice touch! We attempted to clean our clothes using the provided washer,unfortunately it was out of order - Luckily Miriam (and family) washed our clothes and returned them to us - a real lifesaver when you've been travelling for a while!,,
Jamaica Plain itself (from the small amount we saw of it) is a mixed neighbourhood - mostly nice residential houses but with a few shops and restaurants. The apartment is a short-walk from the Boston subway (the T) which is very convenient for getting around all over the city.,,,,,

4765070,39905287,2015-07-27,8382082,Ursula,"Der Aufenthalt in Miriams Wohnung war perfekt für mich. Die Wohnung ist sehr schön hell, die Größe ist optimal und die Ausstattung ist gut durchdacht. Miriam ist sehr großzügig und hatte zur Anreise Lebensmittel zur Verfügung gestellt, dies war eine große Erleichterung für mich. Die Umgebung ist sehr interessant und auch einen großen Rundgang wert. Es gibt viele kleine Geschäfte und auch einen großen Supermarkt. Das Naherholungsgebiet Jamaica Pond mit eleganten Villen drumherum ist nicht weit weg. Öffentliche Verkehrsmittel sind gut erreichbar. Ich habe mich immer sicher und gut aufgenommen gefühlt. Miriam und ihr Ehemann sind wirklich gute Gastgeber. Sollte ich nochmal nach Boston reisen, würde ich gerne wieder bei ihnen wohnen."
4765070,40201403,2015-07-29,28776252,Deb,Miriam was easy to communicate with upon arrival. Asban met us to give a tour of the studio and surrounding area. He was so helpful and trustworthy. Even after an hour when we couldn't access the wifi he came back with someone else that could help us out.
The place was accurately described on the website and was even more quaint in real life. It was quiet and the air conditioner saved us in the heat.,,,,,
All the extras were so sweet of Miriam (bagels,water,fruit,"toothpaste etc). We really enjoyed the area too. Having a parking spot was a real bonus. We will stay again - for sure!\"",,
4765070,40409066,2015-07-30,26749750,Jeremy,"Great place and great hosts!  The apartment was extremely clean and Miriam and her husband made me feel at home immediately.  They even left me some fresh fruit, bagels, and bottled water/juice.  Highly recommended!"

4765070,41210167,2015-08-05,34660587,Axel,We did not meet Miriam itself (Arrival tie was 10 pm) but finding the room was very easy. Fridge was filled with some things for the arrival. And Miriams Husband was so kind to transport us with our luggage to bus station.
4765070,41339652,2015-08-07,11861676,Silke,Miriam made it very comfortable for us to check-in although we arrived very late. The Studio ist just as described and perfect for a couple to stay in Boston.
It was very nice that we found Bagels,Creamcheese,Orange Juice und some fruits for a perfect first breakfast in the fridge. Thank you so much!,,,
"You can do nothing wrong by booking this studio.\"",,,,,
4765070,41597826,2015-08-08,31468855,Daniel,"Clean and cozy place close to a subway station minutes away from Boston's downtown. Highly recommended if you're bringing a car. We even got a couple of complimentary drinks in the fridge, and we found a very friendly cat next to the building."
4765070,41827023,2015-08-09,6337658,Jared And Julie,"The place was exactly as described, very clean and comfortable! Miriam even left us juice and bagels for a quick breakfast. The place is a little further away from downtown than we expected, but only about a 15 minute drive. Definitely recommend this place for the price and value!"
4765070,42147715,2015-08-11,22704175,Khoa,"it was a nice neighborhood , it close to lots of restaurants and market. Its very convenient if u need to get something right away. Mariam and her husband leaved us some water and some snacks which really kind of them. There was parking space for your car too so its great to take your car with you"
4765070,43215670,2015-08-18,10215420,Calum,"Nice hosts, studio was great and had parking. Location was good and had some nice restaurants and bars within walking distance."
4765070,43356291,2015-08-19,3426744,Harry,"This is an efficiency apartment at the rear of a private home, entered from the back porch and secure rear hallway.  I appreciated the cleanliness, a super-comfy bed with (thoughtfully added) extra pillows, clean bathroom with tub, and the fact that the occupants of the rest of the house were so quiet I barely knew they were there.  Quiet neighborhood too.   The host even thoughtfully left bottles of water and juice in the fridge, and there were coffees and teas on the kitchen shelves.  WIFI code was provided (in a binder on the dresser) although I did not use it."
4765070,43523358,2015-08-20,11292098,Ivory,"Miriam's place was easy to find, cozy, convenient, and a great value for the city. For the vertically-challenged such as myself, note that the bed is pretty tall and can be interesting to get in and out of. The kitchen was adequately stocked and there were plenty of calming teas on hand. Only complaints are that there were plenty of towels but no washcloths, and there was a fairly significant amount of dog hair in the rug at the foot of the bed, which gave my nose a little tickle throughout the night. Oh, and be careful if you take hot showers and open the bathroom door immediately after showering. There's a sensitive smoke detector right outside the door and my shower steam set it off in the morning!  Otherwise, well worth the money for my overnight stop in Boston."
4765070,43605532,2015-08-21,30020124,Miles,Everything was great!  Sorry about the delay Miriam; I'm just getting back home now.  Very clean and Miriam's directions were very clear.  She checked-in a week beforehand and everything was set up as we had discussed.
4765070,43924348,2015-08-23,34545646,Carrie,"Miriam gave exact directions to the place and we found it right away. The off street parking is a blessing and the location is close to everything! It's such a cute room with a nice bathroom and lovely kitchen. It's very clean. There are also extra pillows and blankets provided. Miriam put some orange juice and bagels in the fridge, that was very sweet thank you! There is a very large and friendly cat who sits on the deck and welcomes you when you arrive. Loved it! Thank you!"
4765070,44630371,2015-08-28,29546884,Daniel,Studio petit mais pratique. Merci à Miriam pour ses petites attentions lors de l'arrivée et la souplesse horaire pour le départ;

4765070,46466654,2015-09-11,27086431,Colleen,"The studio had absolutely everything we needed - bedroom, bathroom and eat-in kitchen with full facilities. Miriam had also supplied breakfast. She had even supplied travel cards for the bus and train which we could top up as needed, as well as maps of the city and local area. The bus goes from the top of the street for a three-minute ride to the railway station. When we first arrived in the neighbourhood we weren't sure, but then we explored it and found it to be wonderful, friendly and very welcoming. We had drinks at the pub and ate at an Ethiopian restaurant which is very popular with the locals."
4765070,46645199,2015-09-12,42915004,Margaret,The host was available to talk to when we needed to and was close by when we arrived.  No waiting.
The room is small but has everything we needed for the night.  The host told us how to find the grocery store and restaurants easily.,,,,,

On arrival Asman explained everything to us. The place is easy to get to the T station and travel to Boston is a breeze. The place is clean and cute.Thanks to Miriam and Asman.
4765070,47613839,2015-09-21,23642294,Judith,"Miriam and Asman miraculously arrived just as our taxi from the airport arrived and were friendly and very helpful. The apartment is as described but has a homely,cosy feel and is thoughtfully equipped with everything you could possibly need despite its size. We loved the neighbourhood too, an easy stroll to Jackson Square to get the tube into town and a real cosmopolitan, lively feel with good places to eat close by - our favourite was the Ethiopian Blue Nile restaurant- highly recommended especially if you like vegetarian food."
4765070,48162025,2015-09-24,30707652,Loraine,The accommodation was as advertised. Very comfortable and had everything we needed.

4765070,48496698,2015-09-27,31745838,Dirk,"Wir waren Ende September für 2 Nächte in Boston und wurden von Miriam s Mann Husban freundlich empfangen. Er hat uns alles in der Wohnung gezeigt, die sehr liebevoll und gemütlich eingerichtet ist. Es ist alles vorhanden was man braucht! Von der Wohnung zur Metro Station sind es ungefähr 8-10 Minuten zu laufen und dann hat man eine sehr gute Verbindung in die Innenstadt! In der näheren Umgebung hat es einen Supermarkt, kleinere Geschäfte, Restaurants...Wir haben uns in der Ferienwohnung sehr wohl gefühlt und würden sie jederzeit weiterempfehlen!"

The apartment is situated in a quiet neighbourhood about a 10 or 15 minute walk to either the Orange Line or the Green E Line. In other words it was very convenient for transportation. There is a little convenience store half a block away.,,,,,
The apartment itself was clean and neat and simply but very nicely decorated. It had everything I could want. There was also excellent internet. I only stayed for one night but would have been happy there much longer.,,,,,

The neighborhood is great. So peaceful. I will definitely stay at Miriam's place next time I go to Boston.,,,,,

Further,when I reached her place,they already had water bottles,orange juice and burgers waiting for me. That was again very considerate for somebody coming at midnight. They are extremely generous. In fact,I woke up late and left a few hours late. But,to my surprise

4765070,76198426,2016-05-25,34781792,Eugene,Had a great convenient stay!
4765070,77222463,2016-05-30,44112593,Julia,We really liked to stay in Miriams Apartment. It was clean and cosy.
She and her husband are nice and uncomplicated.,,,,,

4765070,77430414,2016-05-31,6504210,Marla,Miriam and her husband were there to greet me and show me everything I needed to know about the studio.  They were very welcoming.  Knowing that they lived across the street was reassuring. The neighborhood was quiet.
4765070,77800206,2016-06-03,21879038,Tom & Latasha,"Really nice place and Miriam and her husband gave us a great welcome and explained the area and gave tips on restaurants. The only downside was that damp mops were stored in the entrance which left a musty smell when you came into the entrance to the apartment. The neighborhood and can feel slightly unsafe at night, but it wasn't dangerous. Everything was very clean, and we especially liked the bathroom and bright white towels!!"
4765070,78441260,2016-06-06,40542480,Stephen,"The property was accurately described in the listing.   It is convenient to have a full working kitchen (including condiments) when travelling in case you don't want to dine out every meal.  The bed was comfortable and bathroom was a little small, but we didn't feel cramped.   Everything was clean and we felt welcome.    We will book here again next time we are in Boston."
4765070,78574758,2016-06-07,56760659,Kim,"Many thanks to Miriam, for helping to make sure that our first Airbnb experience was a positive one. The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and the bagels and juice she provided was a great extra in the morning."

4765070,80784222,2016-06-19,59026356,Scott,Everything was as described. Super quiet neighborhood. Easy to navigate and a stones throw from the city. Would stay there again.

Miriam and her husband provided us with everything one could wish for: a warm and hearty welcome,a cosy and clean flat,bagels,water,OJ and cream cheese in the fridge as well as recommendations for shops and restaurants in the vicinity - especially one for a Cuban restaurant nearby (where we had our farewell dinner and loved it).,

4765070,82147017,2016-06-26,57823015,Beth,"The room was great! This was my first time using Airbnb and now I'm hooked. The apartment had everything we needed. We were only there for a weekend so we didn't use many of the kitchen items, but I checked the cabinets and saw that Miriam has provided everything you could need. It was a 7-10 minute walk to the nearest T stop. The station was closed for construction during the weekend we were there but they provided free buses to the nearest working stop - super easy. Lots of great restaurants the opposite way. The bed was amazing, I felt like I slept better than I had in weeks! Other building residents were super friendly and not obtrusive at all. I don't have cable so the number of TV channels was overwhelming! :) We had no issues with anything. Check out was at 11 am, but we just moved our car from the designated apartment spot to the street and went into the city again afterwards. You can't beat this value staying in the Boston area. I came straight to a conference afterward and have had to deal with so many hotel issues already... Go with Miriam over a hotel, no hassle! We can't wait to come back, thank you!"
4765070,82660867,2016-06-28,36238606,Emily,"Miriam's apartment was clean and had everything we needed. Sha also gave us some orange juice, bread and cream cheese. She also left tips about going around Boston."

I really liked the location of this place.  Jamaica Plain is really quite interesting.  It was perfect for my short stay in Boston.  I would definitely recommend.
4765070,84122582,2016-07-05,57241964,Anthony,"The one bedroom studio is the perfect place to stay if you are looking for a quiet and cozy atmosphere. With me being 6'3\""
4765070,84503622,2016-07-07,13842101,Julia,"We were met out the front by Miriam's husband who gave us a detailed rundown of the apartment and restaurants in the area, which was very helpful. The apartment has all the basics that you need, and the bagels and coffee were a nice touch. Having parking was great as the street was quite narrow."
As others have mentioned,the wi fi isn't great but if you just need to check your emails then it does the job. The neighbourhood was a bit loud too (both nights there were people playing music somewhere close by until quite late - it was midweek,not a weekend). The TV setup was great though if you wanted to watch sport or movies after a day sightseeing.,,,
"Miriam was lovely and helpful in all our communications.\"",,,,,
4765070,84928284,2016-07-09,19701778,Katie,"This was our second time staying at Miriam's rental in Jamaica Plain. Once again, the place was perfectly clean and well equipped. What a comfortable efficiency studio for a brief trip to Boston. About a ten minute walk to the nearby station that takes you directly downtown. We'd be happy to stay here again in the future!"
4765070,88246993,2016-07-23,54604589,Juliane,"Ich kann die Unterkunft für einen Aufenthalt in Boston empfehlen. Miriam und ihr Mann waren sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und leicht zu kontaktieren. Die Anbindung an die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel ist gut. Man benötigt 25 bis 30 Minuten mit der U-Bahn, um ins Stadtzentrum zu gelangen. Die Bahnen fahren in kurzen Abständen. Im Apartment gibt es alles, was man für das tägliche Leben benötigt. Zwei große Supermärkte sind in der Nachbarschaft."
Das Viertel ist sehr belebt,"multikulturell und \"\"jung\"\"",ich habe mich zu jeder Tageszeit sehr sicher gefühlt.,,,
Das W-Lan hat leider nicht immer funktioniert bzw. war teils nur sehr langsam. Diejenigen,die lärmempfindlich sind,sollten für abends unbedingt Ohrstöpsel dabeihaben,da es zum Einen im Haus sehr hellhörig ist und man die Bewohner des Hauses recht laut hört; zum Anderen wird in der Nachbarschaft öfter laute Musik gespielt.,,
Insgesamt ist das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis für Boston angemessen. Ich würde die Unterkunft wieder buchen.,,,,,

4765070,91336239,2016-08-04,67060350,Kyle,"Miriam and her apartment were great for the two nights we were there. My wife and I were supposed to be there for three nights, but due to a flight cancellation we arrived later than expected. Miriam was wonderful in communicating with us and adjusting her schedule to accommodate our arrival plans."
When we arrived she greeted us at the door and gave us the key as well as a quick tour of the apartment. It had everything we needed and more,as Miriam provided us with bagels and orange juice for the next morning,which was a nice and appreciated touch.,,,
The neighborhood is quaint and within walking distance there are multiple small,locally owned cafés and restaurants which provided a wide array of foods. Everything from fresh seafood and delicious breakfast,to ethnic choices like Indian and Ethiopian. Though the apartment is a little outside of the heart of Boston,it was a short walk from the metro/bus station,which took us into the city in about 20 minutes. We took an Uber on the way back from the city,and it was less than $15.
The apartment was a little smaller than expected,but overall was very comfortable and accommodating. Add in the gracious host that Miriam was,"and I would recommend her apartment for anyone's stay in Boston.\"",,,
4765070,91852623,2016-08-06,58183346,M J,"Our host welcomed us and showed us everything,  I clouding drawing maps and recommend getting restaurants.  He was particularly generous when our car-hire company delayed us .. He took all our luggage into his home and waited for us to arrive back with the car ...Two hours after our check out time! The studio had all we needed for a short stay."

4765070,94041166,2016-08-14,2194374,Meghan,The studio apartment at Miriam's was great! We were in Jamaica Plain visiting friends who also live there so the location was perfect for us. The apartment itself was clean and well-appointed. We appreciated little things like bagels and orange juice left for us and toothpaste and toiletries in the bathroom. And there was free parking as well. It was like staying in a hotel but for a much more affordable price. I told my friends who live in the area to recommend it to all their visitors!!
4765070,94960344,2016-08-17,43113546,Daniele,Abbiamo soggiornato per tre notti presso questa sistemazione per visitare Boston. L'appartamento è piccolo ma dotato di tutto il necessario per trascorrere pochi giorni. È situato a 10 min dalla linea arancione della metro con cui in 15 min si arriva in centro di Boston. Il quartiere è tranquillo e varipinto e c'è un bel parco vicino dove passeggiare o andare in barca sullo stagno. Ha il parcheggio per gli ospiti. Unica pecca il wifi molto debole e quasi inutilizzabile. Per il resto ok.
4765070,95192887,2016-08-18,45942229,Lisha,The host was responsive and the place was ok but our experience was cut very short because there was an extremely strong perfume smell used during the cleaning process. The smell was so strong that we could not stay in the home for more than 5 minutes without getting a headache. We decided to leave the place immediately and did not even unpack. If you are sensitive to strong smells this is not the right place for you.
4765070,96130967,2016-08-21,62548039,Lauren,a great place for two! Close to the orange line and safe place to walk at night.
4765070,96446237,2016-08-22,263394,Lori,Miriam was a pleasure to deal with.  Her place looked better than the pictures made it look! She was very accommodating in meeting upon our arrival and kept in communication with me arrival morning.  We had our very own parking spot in the back of the house which is rare in Boston.  This made us feel secure leaving our car there.  There was beautiful art work and paintings on the back of the house and neat pieces of art from around the world in the apartment.  The place is small but fitted our needs perfectly.  The apartment was very clean and smelt very good.  The bed was also very comphy!  We took an Uber from Fenway back to the apartment and it only cost about $5.  We originally walked to Fenway and it was about a 45 minute walk along a pretty park.  Over all our experience was great and we will return when we are in Boston.
4765070,96883504,2016-08-24,12208099,Simen,Great location! Shops and restaurants within walking distance. Metro was a little longer but still very close. A/C was non-functioning but it was not a problem as it was shady and the weather was not too hot weather.

Small but just right for my wife and I. It was modern and well decorated. The location is great as it is in the heart of the North End. There are only a few very high windows so there is not much natural light. That said,since the place is on the ground floor and on a fairly busy street it is probably best that there are not more Windows as it would be noisier. The bedroom is in the rear of the apartment away from the street so it is nice and quiet back there.,,,,

It had all the amenities anyone could want, washer/dryer, full kitchen.  It was a huge plus to have off street parking. We had a 10 min walk (if that)  to the T  , which we took to the TD Garden.  Tony was very attentive - sending emails a couple weeks prior to our arrival and then 1 week prior to our arrival. Would definitely rent from Tony in the future. We had a wonderful experience renting from Tony and Airbnb."

9109401,69723234,2016-04-12,28118477,Jim,"The apartment was fairly comfortable, with a nicely remodeled bathroom and a functional kitchen, but we had some noise from the upstairs neighbors (their kids seem to run a lot), as well as the busy street outside.  Some of the furniture appeared to have been found at sidewalk sales, and we don't mean that in a positive way (e.g., a small dresser in the rear bedroom was basically unusable because the support for the middle drawer was broken)."
The neighborhood is a mixed bag,with chain shops and restaurants interspersed with several good local restaurants and interesting shops,all within walking distance of the apartment.  We did not find a convenient subway stop,and didn't have time to ride the bus,so we ended up taking Uber when we needed to get to other parts of Boston.,
Tony is a very nice guy who was quick to respond to our requests,including allowing us to leave our luggage for a couple of hours after we checked out,"and looking for an item that our son thought he had left behind (turned out that he didn't).\"",,,

9109401,72223316,2016-05-01,18168313,Sabine,"We really enjoyed staying in Tony’s apartment, the place was clean and it is exactly as shown on the pictures. It is a great space for a family as the kitchen is very well stocked and the dining room very convenient. Great renovated bathroom! The beds are very comfortable, the quality of the sheets and towels is nice."
The fact that there are books,board games and all amenities really made it feel like a home away from home.,,,,
Being able to park in the driveway made the logistics very easy. We did not walk too much in the neighborhood but it looks perfectly safe. The bus and the T are very close by and super convenient so we were able to explore the city.,,,,,
The only issue is that the street can be noisy,especially in the morning. But except for that,"we had a great time and we would definitely recommend this rental to any of our friends! \"",,,

There were instructions on how to use the wifi, transportation, things to do in the area, etc. It was cozy and felt like home and we actually spent more time in the condo because of this. The bedrooms nice, comfortable and spacious. We did have an issue with an A/C unit in one of the bedrooms one evening, but Tony had someone come out to replace it first thing the next morning. I definitely recommend this beautiful condo and I will be staying here any time I visit Boston again."

The one issue we had was remedied quickly and Tony was very accessible when we did have a question or needed something.
The town house was just as described,very nice. We didn't get the cable to work but we weren't there much anyway. The kids watched you tube videos instead.,,,,

The location is convenient to stores and restaurants, all the major attractions in the city (because of access to the T), and to the airport. My only warning with the airport is that while the buses run all night from the station, the station itself is locked until 5:15 am, so you cannot get through to the buses if you have a super-early flight (which probably does not affect all that many travelers). In that case, a cab ride is $10 and very easy. We did that, but my husband also returned a rental car we'd been using for tge previous week when we arrived (you definitely don't need a car) and used the bus on the way back. He said it was unbelievably easy. Regardless of airport stuff, you cannot beat the proximity to public transportation. Like in any city or unfamiliar place, I would move about in pairs after dark... a comment I'd make for here, Boston Commons, or basically any neighborhood."

The room was as described, clean and organized.  Her roommates are nice but I did not have a chance to meet Renata.  There are certainly requests made by the hostess that should be disclosed on the description of the shared bathroom. The location is very convenient to those needing access to the Longwood Area.

The guest room wardrobe contained belongings of another person, hallways had furniture items which seemed to be in transit & the living room was occupied as a bedroom by two & sometimes three people with personal belongings scattered throughout.. The kitchen was in a state of disarray with unwashed dishes etc."
Of particular concern was the unclean state of the kitchen,bathroom & floors.,,,,
On two occasions I found the door to my guest room open after returning from a day out- there was no way of locking the door to secure my belongings prior to leaving. This concerned me given that apart from the host there appeared to be two  other sets of guests certainly unknown to me & probably the host.

Renata was very friendly, accommodating for our arrival and departure and there to answer any questions we had. The room was conveniently located across from a Green Line stop.  There were many restaurants and a laundromat within walking distance. The kitchen was made available to us, although we did not use it other than storing some items in the refrigerator. The other people dwelling in the apartment were very friendly and provided us with directions and recommendations around the city. We would not hesitate to stay there again."

She was so welcoming and checked in to make sure everything was going smoothly. Her home was very comfortable and exactly as described. The area is lovely, a quiet neighborhood close to transportation with easy access to downtown Boston. Linda even had a metro pass to make things easy. The room was just as it looks (even better, actually!)- sunny, cozy and very comfortable. This was a wonderful space to come back to after long days. It immediately felt like home away from home. I would definitely stay here again."

My daughter and I had a wonderful week together touring Boston and staying in a home setting rather than a cold impersonal hotel.  The bus line is very close and convenient and the train lines make getting around simple without renting a car.  Double thumbs up for this experience with AirBnB.  Thanks Linda!

She is so laid back, and has such a gentle personality. The listing was absolutely as described, the neighborhood was safe and quiet, and the accommodations were beautiful. We shared a bathroom with other guests, but the bathroom is very large, and everyone is respectful of each other's space and schedule. It was never awkward at all. Such a warm, friendly atmosphere all through the house. Also, Linda makes some killer carrot breakfast muffins! I definitely recommend staying with her, and would stay again myself!

I had come to run the Boston marathon, and Linda even came to cheer me and the woman I came with on. She was excited for us to have finished as if we had been one of her family members. The room we stayed in was nicer than the photos, the beds are comfy, her place was impeccably clean and with lovely duvets. We had ample towels, hot water,  and great coffee. Having a door with a digicode is a real plus- so simple to use, and we really appreciated her having given us a metro pass to use.

What we feel beyond expectation is the breakfast.  Linda prepared many kinds of breads, fruits and there is also juice, milk, almond milk, yogurt for your choice.

Nous avons été ravies de partager la cuisine avec les deux locataires qui vivent à l'année dans cette grande maison. Comme Linda était partie camper ce sont ces deux jeunes locataires qui nous ont accueillies et qui nous ont aidées à nous installer. Elles ont été de précieuses ambassadrices et nous les en remercions. Nous avons trouvé à quelques centaines de mètres de la maison deux épiceries et un petit resto chinois très sympa. Le seul inconvénient c'est la distance de la maison au Downtown : Linda nous avait procuré deux cartes Charlie pour les déplacements en bus et train. Nous les avons utilisés mais aussi nous avons utilisé Uber beaucoup plus rapide et moins cher que les taxis. Globalement très satisfaites de notre séjour, nous recommandons vivement la maison de Linda."

There's a big park directly across the street and the redline T station is a 5 minute walk or less, making this location very peaceful and convenient.

We had good communication leading up to our stay and a very positive experience overall.  The location was perfect, with short walking distance to Copley Square and other attractions.  They couldn't accommodate our late checkout, but did store our luggage free at a property a little over a block away."

3182473,49944417,2015-10-07,8115116,Frederic,Nice quaint apartment in good location. Building and room opens with keypad which allows for easy check in. Note that pictures are not of actual unit but actual is very comparable.
3182473,50983135,2015-10-16,1919944,Beth,"Best location in quiet neighborhoid but steps from everything. Unit is nice size alternative to hotel room. Decor is modern colors and freshly remodeled. Basic not luxury. Plenty of blankets, towels, soaps and shampoos. Loved the air conditioner in the bedroom. Nice kitchen but we didn't cook because so many good restaurants in the area. Negatives: plastic over the mattress makes it impossible to tuck in bottom sheet and noisy when you toss and turn. Despite that, it was a comfortable mattress. Common hallway needs work and is not a welcoming experience. Despite that, entry to unit and building is very easy. Owner was easy to communicate with by e mail."
3182473,51590917,2015-10-21,8115116,Frederic,Very efficient and easy to deal with host.  I received a set of codes and full instructions the day before arriving.  Property was well maintained and felt cozy.  Host was very responsive even late at night when I had questions about the apartment.

The host accommodated me when I arrived an hour earlier than expected and remotely re-programmed the codes to allow me entry.  The property is in a very central location, walking distance to Back Bay station, and the Copley or Hynes T-stops.  Would definitely stay here again next time I'm visiting Boston."
3182473,52526795,2015-10-30,32011892,Michelle,The code locked doors that change for every guest put me at ease. The apartments are new and freshly decorated. Great for the business traveler that is staying for a week.  I had to change apartments and they responded immediately and was able to find me another location.

The apartment is pretty enormous. 2br,one with a queen and a full,the other with just a full. Perfectly clean,and lots of space,especially in the main room. The two fulls were very comfortable,the queen slightly less so. I would probably prefer an air bed to the couch
Location is excellent. Right near BU. Also a 5 minute walk away is the Sunset Tap & Grill,which I wouldn't pass up on especially if you are a fan of craft beer.,,,,
The only problem I had was with the parking. The parking space provided with the room is actually a pass to park in an apartment building lot which does (and did for us) fill up. If this happens,it is possible to park on the street (which at the time was also full). The situation was probably worsened by the snow we had at the time we stayed,as snow mounds cut down on the number of spaces available. There are several paid lots nearby,"which are good to fall back on if you find the lot full.\"",,

4106372,35590902,2015-06-20,19065904,Tim,"The experience was great.  We had come in on  a red eye from Los Angeles and Nathaniel allowed us to check in early and met us at the apartment on his way to work.  The place is clean and well stocked with kitchen utensils and other supplies you may need during your stay.  It was a perfect location for us as it was practically on the B.U.campus.  There is an amazing grocery store two blocks away that is open 24hrs and has anything you could want.  Good restaurants, and the T are all within walking distance.  Thanks Nathaniel and Jin for making our time in Boston easy safe and comfortable --"
4106372,36069212,2015-06-24,35807585,Andi,"Nathaniel was very accommodating -- he waited to hand us the keys even though we were slightly later than the check-in time. The place was very clean and cozy, exactly as advertised. Would definitely recommend his place for anyone visiting Boston."
4106372,37401574,2015-07-06,33972951,Fiona,"Nathaniel was so accommodating.  My group and I arrived about 30 min earlier than expected and Nathaniel was accommodating in making sure that we did not wait long to receive the keys.   He gave us a mini tour of the apartment, and made sure that we knew exactly where everything was located.  The home was so clean and welcoming, and made every one of us more than ready to settle in.  Everything was so clean and accessible.     This neighborhood was so nice and convenient to almost everything that you may need when visiting. They have a supermarket no more than 5 min away that opens 24/7!  An awesome time at Boston! My group and I established that we would be more than happy to stay at this apartment again the next time we want to come back to Boston!"

4106372,40328538,2015-07-30,23356669,Zhiyu,"This apartment was not in conformity with the description. The original said there are 4 beds, in fact, only three beds and a sofa. Now they have modified the description.Our experience with Nathaniel was rather unpleasant. Seemingly, Nathaniel is willing to lease his apartment, however, he is unwilling or unready to help his lodgers who come afar. We booked the apartment for two nights, and communicated with him about parking of two cars. His answer seemed fine, indicating that we might park the car at an avenue for free or at a parking lot for $10/12 per day. But, his answer tuned out to be inaccurate, or misleading on the day of our arrival. We, who were new in Boston, was shocked to find that visitor parking was not permitted allowed along most streets, and limited to two hours at other streets. We went to the BU parking garage suggested by Nathaniel in his message, only to be told by the woman working there that overnight parking was not permitted. But, Nathaniel knew that we were to stay for two days, instead of two or a couple of hours. Then, I called his wife, telling her our situation and asking for help. She told us that she did not know about parking and would let her husband contact us. Until nearly 2 hours later, we received a message from Nathaniel (instead of a phone call in such emergence although), giving us three options, and saying that “please review my profile – all the information that you need about our house and parking is listed there”. As complete strangers in Boston, we were in need at that time, and immediately answered his message and inquired whether we could park our car for two days at any of the locations suggested in his options, but he has never answered this inquiry, even till today when I write my comments. Finally, after two-hour search, we, desperate and helpless, managed to find a parking lot several blocks away from the apartment and paid $48 for two-day parking. Therefore, seemingly, Nathaniel is willing to lease his apartment, however, he is unwilling or unready to help his lodgers who come afar."
4106372,43217974,2015-08-18,28046361,Sergio,"The house looked almost exactly as in pictures. It is conveniently located in Allston, twenty minutes from downtown Boston with a close green line metro station, in a quiet street. If you are by car you are provided with a local permit which is really helpful. Shops and supermarkets at walking distance. Equipment is okay for small groups, remind you have one bathroom. Nathaniel was a helpful host, on time and precise."

29765,122638,2010-10-19,249384,Stephanie,"Elizabeth was an AMAZING host and her suite is absolutely beautiful. The pics do not do the suite justice..I cant tell you how much peace, warmth, and coziness this suite provides.Upon walking into the suite there's this lovely zen music playing which welcomes you into the space you are entering. I highly recommend you stay here! I'm already thinking about future trips at Elizabeth suite. I cant say enough wonderful things about Elizabeth...since this was my first trip to Boston and it was going to be two days.. i wanted to ensure I had enough time to do everything I planned and Elizabeth was so nice to look over my list to tell me what was doable along with providing recommendations of her own. one recommendation was this delicious brunch spot Accquavit (I believe is the name). Yummy! Theres also a guide in the suite of things to do and places to try. There were so many warm touches in the apt like breakfast in the fridge, tea, nuts, and apples on the counter, and a bottle of wine in the living room. Since im always cold I enjoyed the heaters in the two rooms. There's also a fireplace but the heaters were just fine for me.It really was a home away from home. The suite is located in a wonderful area that isn't far from little italy/freedom trail. The suite is spacious...I came with my best friend and there was enough space for us to do our own thing (she studied in the bedroom while i relaxed in the living room). I LOVE LOVE this place!"

Provision were generous and the kitchen a delight to cook in. Thanks so much Elizabeth, we have already recommended your place to at least 3 other couples and we'd love to return ourselves, even just to enjoy the decor of your beautiful apartments and to eat at the local Moroccan restaurant again.

I wish I could give her 6 stars. She left wine and flowers out to greet us. All the fixings for a great breakfast. Even hooked up the chocolate.

We had such a great stay, we will recommend your places to many of our friends who come to Boston for either business trips or vacations often. Special thanks to you for a very well decorated top floor suite and the red wine just hit a home run in our hearts. I can't thank you enough for everything you have done in this place. Five-star all the way!"

The room and  all the work  she put into making us feel  comfortable  during our stay made this a great experience.  Having a kitchen for breakfast, or whatever meal gave  a very relaxed feeling to our stay. This is a real gem of a find!"

This is my second time at her lovely suite and I'm in love with it as it was my first time. This time I came for a girls weekend instead of just visiting Boston and my best friend described it as the best place for the getaway. Everything is superb from Elizabeth details to the suite to the caring touches of wine, breakfast, and snacks she provides. A home away from home indeed! I will be back! When you have Elizabeth suite why stay anywhere else while in Boston."
29765,530093,2011-09-14,398830,Belinda,"We recently stayed at Elizabeth's Moroccan Furnishings Apartment in Boston and it was fabulous.  The apartment is on the third floor and encompasses a large bedroom, bathroom, full kitchen and lounge.  The location in Charlestown is excellent, quiet but in easy walking distance to  Downtown.  Elizabeth left lots of information about what to see and where to visit, restaurants and a summary of the various beautiful furnishings in the apartment.  In addition to this, Elizabeth left a number of yummy things to eat and there was coffee, tea, sugar, oil etc all the basics needed to home cook which we did on one night.  We cannot speak more highly of this accommodation and if anyone is thinking of staying in Boston and they want a beautiful peaceful place to stay surrounded by lovely homes, streets and history than this is it."

The space is a perfect mixture of a fine bed and breakfast with a stylish and trendy Moroccan museum.  The beverages and food included in the room were well received as was the selection of restaurants and the freedom trail being with in steps of the front door.  Just absolutely splendid and we hope to stay again.

It feels like a house with history. It is unusual to find a place to stay with such character. I am an architect so I'm fussy about these things ;)"

29765,1146708,2012-04-18,1168031,Tom,"This place is a beautiful house built in the 1770's, but with all the modern convienences. Elizabeth was a great host who even saved us from a not so honest cab driver who tried to charge us twice for one ride. Everything was provided for us to help in our exploration of the Boston area ie. Guidebooks, transportation info etc. Breakfast items were tasty and plentiful. The neighborhood is the historic Bunker Hill area and is very safe and friendly. We were also only a short walk from the equally Historic North end where Paul Reveres house and the Old North Church are located as well as many wonderful Italian restaurants. We definately hope to return someday."

Elizabeth was a charming host and brightened our last day with a gift of a bottle of bubbles :) which we enjoyed in her pretty back yard... can't say enough good things about this place. Having travelled through New England staying in a variety of places, this one topped the lot - We will return!"

The suite is fantastic - more than your average B&B.  . It is private and quiet - in a great neighbourhood.  Elizabeth has thought of everything.  Most comfortable bed we've ever slept in,our own private living room filled with interesting books and DVDs,and incredible Moroccan furnishings.,,,

The interior was so beautiful and comfortable that we even stayed in one night just to enjoy the location more. It was so convenient to have a microwave and stovetop to make tea in the morning, and so sweet of Elizabeth to provide bags of tea and coffee as well. The unique textile were a luxurious touch. Elizabeth was a great host and even let us hang out and called us a cab to bring us to the airport the day of our departure. The town is full of charm and history and very convenient to the subway and if you want to do the full tourist experience the orange trolley stop is only a nice walk away. The guide that Elizabeth put together for the town of Charlestown and for Boston itself is full of gold mines. Such a unique spot but one I will never forget. Thanks Elizabeth!"
29765,2743804,2012-10-29,3180587,Ian,"We stayed at Elizabeth’s for 4 days at the end of October 2012, it was our first visit to Massachusetts and we were hoping to find the perfect place."
The pictures we’d seen on line were lovely however; in person it was it was fabulous!,,,,,
Unique,eclectic and the overall feel of the condo was very pleasant and inviting; we were comfortable and felt at home almost at once.,,,,
The day we were to leave was the day before hurricane Sandy was to hit,we left the condo as planned for the airport only to find that many flights were already canceled among them mine. Now stuck in Boston,with a huge storm coming and no place to stay because the hotels were full already and those that were not were EXTREMELY expensive,now facing spending days at the airport we decided to call Elizabeth to see if it were possible to return and wait out the storm. She was wonderful!,,
Not only did she allow me to return she offer to come to the airport and pick me up if a taxi wasn’t available. She was a godsend,we plan return to Boston,"and when we do I hope that we are able to stay at Elizabeth’s again. \"",,,

I especially loved the fully stocked fridge (coffee, eggs, muffins) and snacks with all the stuff from trader joe's that I actually use at home (nuts, greek yogurt, etc.)!  When you travel a lot, sometimes that little things really make a big difference.  I HIGHLY recommend this place for a romantic weekend or for a business traveler (like myself) who wants a break from the sterile monotony of hotels."

The small touches that Elizabeth and bill put into the place is just gorgeous. It was my birthday weekend and just to make me feel special was a bottle of wine and a note. I was sooo sad to leave this place. It was like an oasis. Elizabeth and bill couldn't be more sweet and accommodating . The food was even stock with organic items from trader joes. Wow.

The fireplace was such a nice way to end of a day exploring Boston. I highly recommend staying here if Boston is your destination. The fridge is stocked for a hearty breakfast before you head out. Charlestown is a quaint little neighborhood with lots of history. We stayed 5 nights and still left so many things we want to explore, so definitely have plans to go back again.

I work really hard to provide an amazing experience for my guests, so, when I was looking for the perfect place in Boston prior to a conference, I diligently searched 5-Star Listings, price no object.  I wanted my trip to be super special.  WOW!  I hit the jackpot!!  First of all, Elizabeth responded immediately and made me feel like an old friend coming to town.  She sent me all kinds of good information, including a clip from a TV Show where her splendid apartment was featured.  So exciting!  When I arrived at an un-Godly hour, Fabulous Bill was there to greet me and to help me with my luggage up to the penthouse suite in this historic building.  The apartment is simply divine, unique and beautiful.  Vibrant colors, textures and special artistic touches were everywhere.  There is a tranquil, beautifully appointed garden courtyard where we sat and had wine and cheeses in the warm evening breezes.  Bliss!  The neighborhood was outstanding!  Located in the oldest part of Boston, the neighborhood is filled with beautiful, quaint brick homes lovingly adorned with colorful flower boxes.  You pass right by the monument at Bunker Hill (I climbed the 294 steps to the top to take it spectacular 360 degree views).  Historical Parks and Gas Lamp lined narrow streets lead you down to the water's edge to Old Ironside.  The waterfront in Charlestown is really, really nice!  We dined at Pier 6, Elizabeth's recommendation, with sweeping views of the harbor and the Boston Skyline.  Cool breezes delighted us as we dined al fresco.  Simply wonderful!!  Elizabeth takes great pride in providing an outstanding experience -- every detail in place.  Elizabeth and Bill are caring hosts and her suites are divine!

Bill clearly did everything to ensure it was all ship shape and I certainly was not disappointed. Great spacious apartment close to loads of bars and restaurants. Great communication from Bill also. I'll be back on my next trip to Boston."
12987348,79677353,2016-06-13,6108218,Luc,"\"Nous avons passé un très bon week end à Boston dans l'appartement de Bill. Nous étions une famille avec 4 adultes et deux enfants en bas âge.  L'emplacement était parfait, et la tenue des lieux excellente. La gestion et la communication avec l'hôte étaient parfaites. Nous recommandons cet appartement pour des courts séjours pour profiter de la \"\"nightlife\"\" de Boston. Petit bémol"
12987348,80162808,2016-06-16,4126737,Christine,"The flat was very nice, spacious and new!  So new in fact, it felt like we were the first ones to occupy the space.  The location is great and the price was reasonable for a 2BD 2BT unit, a rare find in the heart of Boston and great if you are sharing with friends but need some privacy.  They left a few snacks for us too which was a nice bonus."
The only challenge was that there was no flexibility in the unusually late check in time,4pm,which meant we needed to book a day hotel for one of our colleagues arriving early on an international flight.  Otherwise,all went as planned and our stay was enjoyable.,,

12987348,85824904,2016-07-13,76401675,Lane,"The listing was exactly what we were expecting - perfectly situated in the financial district and close to all the historical sites downtown. A number of really good restaurants and cafes  within a block or two. An easy walk to the North End for some great food, and quite convenient to the aquarium, Quincy Market and Boston Common as well."
The beds were both extremely comfortable,and the bathrooms and showers were very clean. The common space allowed the four of us to have plenty of time to visit and talk in the mornings and before bed in the evenings.,,,,

12987348,91042767,2016-08-03,54975002,Charles,"This was the first time I have used airbnb.com and can honestly say that it exceeded all my expectations. I set this trip up relatively last minute for a family of 6 and received an immediate response from Bill followed by very clear communication on directions for securing the apartment. The apartment itself was located in an ideal location for my family and I to take in as many sites as we could in our short stay (Aquarium, Quincy market and the North end). I would highly recommended this listing to anyone traveling to Boston and looking to be within walking distance of all it has to offer."
12987348,91722803,2016-08-06,27612919,Mandi,"Has a great time in Boston at Bill's loft! It was beautiful, spacious and clean. Great neighborhood, easy walk to Faneuil Hall, the North End and Waterfront. Quiet street at night. I was able to check in early and got a late check out!

We had a group of six including two small children and found everything we needed.   The location was fantastic for sightseeing.  We went out for lunch and walked most of the freedom Trail, stopping at the playground, and were back within 4 hours for dinner.  Beautiful apartment with great view of the financial district."
12987348,95133458,2016-08-18,90259285,Amanda,"Our host was great! Bill answered all my questions and got back to me quickly. Key exchange was perfect and the young lady was very nice! Check in time was 4pm but we were able to get the keys and drop off out bags way before that and check out is early but it was doable! The listing photos were spot on everything looked as I expected it to, it was very clean, the building is beautiful and pretty quiet. It was right in the center of everything in Boston and literally 2-5 minute park to all attractions! I hope to stay here again in the future!"

Place: Extremely new,interior design was fantastic,everything works perfectly. Photos were very accurate. We also love the place. Beds were very comfortable.,,,
Neighborhood & Getting around: Quiet most of the time,pretty safe,very close to T-station. Parking can be tricky you have to read the sign really well. Perfect for public transport fans.,,,
"If I have to go back to Boston with similar company size I will put a request on this place again for sure.\"",,,,,
7003280,37922607,2015-07-11,8487306,Marta,"Just had a wonderful stay in the apartment. Definitely five stars. The place was exactly as described, very clean, and lovely. The hosts were very responsive and helpful in getting us settled. I was there to work in the area so I did not travel, but the apartment is right next to the Andrew T stop so I imagine getting around would be very easy."
7003280,38536808,2015-07-16,11147887,Kyle,"James was a great host, he was very responsive from initial contact til I left. The keys on a lock box which makes everything very simple. The place isn't in the prettiest neighborhood but the location is excellent considering you are ten minutes from convention center, downtown, north-end, harbor etc. The place is all newly decorated and furnished and also has washer and dryer and nice tv, well worth the value. I would definitely recommend to a friend and stay again, cheers."
7003280,38667217,2015-07-17,38202836,Dawn,Neighborhood busy. Listing exactly as stated. Owner gave us prooer info. Lock box hard to open but owner was replacing. Very nice apartment. Perfect for us. Fresh and modern decor. Comfortable beds.
7003280,39079815,2015-07-20,26762251,Trasie,We had a great stay at James' apartment. The description was accurate and it was decorated nicely and very clean. We liked that it was close to the subway stop for easy access to just about anywhere.
7003280,39437820,2015-07-23,4505881,Karen,"Communication with the host was clear and speedy.  The apartment is convenient to the subway system for those who don't like driving in Boston.  We traveled with 2 teens.  I wouldn't recommend the apartment to those with younger children due to breakables and the need for quiet for the other tenants.  The apartment was comfortable, however the refrigerator was quite noisy.  We appreciated having use of the washer and dryer.  It is also within walking distance to a lovely beach and park."
7003280,39681646,2015-07-25,8259157,Charles,"Very nice apartment in up and coming neighborhood.  James was more than accommodating, and even went out of his way to allow an early check-in."

7003280,41119050,2015-08-04,34853405,Michelle,"James and his staff were very accommodating to our needs; arrival time and departure time. In addition to that, once alerted that the refrigerator was not cooling properly someone was out the very next day to fix it. The unit is fairly new - pictures weren't deceiving. The only downside was that this area is still struggling with gentrification. Walking to the T line (1 minute away) wasn't always the nicest. Also, during our stay there was construction work right next door starting at 8am. I'm an early-bird so it did not bother me as much as my husband. In a nutshell, modern cozy apartment in an easy access location to anywhere in the city."
7003280,41851829,2015-08-09,5122312,Tania Et Quentin,"L'appartement correspond parfaitement à la description, il y a même un petit balcon :)"
Si vous cherchez un endroit propre,qui s'apparente à un hotel et que vous êtes en voiture,allez y ! Si vous êtes à pieds,le quartier n'est pas terrible mais le métro est à deux pas.,,
"Thank you James !\"",,,,,
7003280,42576319,2015-08-14,8877209,Gisele,We enjoyed our stay at Boston in James appartment. Location is very convenient close to the Station. There is really no need for a car. Appartment is very well equiped and furbished.
7003280,42907192,2015-08-16,38953303,Louis,"The apartment was nice, had everything we needed.  The subway (Andrew) is at a one minute walk distance. Indications about how to use the appliances would help.  All indications about reaching the apartment were perfect.  The unit was very clean."
7003280,43795995,2015-08-22,12169108,Henrik,"Me and a co-worker stayed in James apartment for six nights and had a really good experience. The apartment is perfect if you need two separate bedrooms. The beds were good and everything in the apartment was in nice condition, exactly as in the pictures."
Prior to the trip James responded quickly to all messages and we were able to each get a separate pair of keys. The apartment is conveniently  located close to the Andrew station on the Red train line (about 2 minutes walk),allowing you to get into central Boston very quickly. We were attending a conference at the Convention centre (my recommendation for getting there: Red Line to South Station and then Silver Line to World Trade Centre,takes 20-25 minutes) and found the public transportation very good and flexible without any long waiting times.,,,
"Overall a very positive Airbnb experience.\"",,,,,
7003280,45968094,2015-09-07,3372053,Dale,Everything was just as described.  James sent perfect instructions and the entire stay went very smoothly.  The neighborhood is up and coming. We found several nice places to eat and snack and getting to the T is super easy.
7003280,46718983,2015-09-13,2679745,Sandra,"Spotless, comfy flat at a convenient location. James responded quickly to all our requests, and did his best to accommodate them. Highly recommended."
7003280,47330666,2015-09-17,19499355,Kathrine,"Vores ophold i James' lejlighed var yderst behageligt. Vi kontaktede James meget kort tid før vores ønskede rejsedato, men alligevel var James meget hurtig til at svare på vores henvendelse og alt forløb meget nemt og James gav alle de oplysninger, vi havde brug for. Lejligheden var rar og med god plads til vores behov (to par). To minutters gang til Andrew Station og derfra 5 min. til centrum. Alt i alt en meget positiv oplevelse."
7003280,47422494,2015-09-18,2484196,Katherine,Everything about this place was great.
The location was excellent,the apartment was very comfortable and our host was great about getting back to us with answers to our questions.,,,,

7003280,47691776,2015-09-21,22955686,Carolyn,We enjoyed our stay here. The apartment was close to the T and the Andrew Station (red line) stop was a quick and easy walk. The design was contemporary and it was very clean.
When the electricity in the bedrooms went out one evening,we notified James and his staff (Jay) late in the evening and received an immediate response. The problem was fixed the next day and we appreciated the prompt resolution.,,,,
The building is quiet and it seems like several of the buildings in the neighborhood are being renovated.,,,,,
We felt like this was a great find in the city and would love to stay there again.,,,,,

7003280,47825721,2015-09-21,43675932,Dana,Jay was a wonderful host and responded quickly to all requests. We were able to find street parking directly out front of the apartment which was great! Overall it was a lovely apartment that provided everything we needed for our trip :)
7003280,48073808,2015-09-23,14825914,Heidi,We had a very nice time in the apartemt. Just a minute to the t-line. Perfect for our stay. I really recommend it . HEIDI from munich
7003280,48233756,2015-09-24,44303037,Jessie,"Very nice place to stay - clean, comfortable, and located in a nice area. James provided simple instructions and advice, and responded in a timely manner to all messages. My friends and I had a great experience here!"
7003280,48422416,2015-09-26,3518802,Hilary,"This South Boston apartment was exactly as described - clean, very inviting, and super close to the Red Line train stop at Andrew.  Although we did not make extensive use of them, the additional amenities (TV, laundry, kitchen) were an added bonus.  Communicating with Jay, the owner, was very easy, and he accommodated any request we had during our stay."
The street on which the apartment is located does get a fair amount of vehicle traffic,as well as foot traffic,so just note that the day's sights and sounds do start rather early.  Although there is street parking,as indicated in the listing,pay attention to signage - most spots on the street in front of the apartment have a two hour limit,and there is no overnight parking allowed on most days unless you are a resident with a permit.  For anyone that does plan on having a car
Overall,this was a great experience,and I would consider staying here again (though probably without a car next time!),,,

7003280,49169736,2015-10-01,7826437,Maggie,"James left us keys in the lockbox  which made check in a snap!  The condo was cute and cozy and close to the T.   The new Whole Foods is about a mile away. The traffic was a bit noisy in the early morning, but I live in the boondoggies, so that may just be me.   There was coffee/milk  and water which was appreciated."

We used the local small grocery store, hairdressers, and pizza take out. James responded quickly to my queries."

We tried Cafe Polonia, a nearby Polish restaurant and it was incredible.  The apartment was cute and clean.  The washer and dryer were a huge help as we were half-way through our trip and needed to do laundry. I would highly recommend a stay at the Modern South Boston apartment."
7003280,52058143,2015-10-26,41851500,Theodora,It was a true pleasure to stay in James apartment.  We were four friends staying there for four nights.  The apartment is well furnished and we four housewifes didn't miss anything. The location is great close to the subway and you can easily travel to Boston Logan airport.

7003280,55005882,2015-11-27,24024548,John,Our host James made us feel very welcome. It is a comfortable apartment and near the subway station which is great. The area itself is not particularly interesting but it is a short subway ride to the main highlights of Boston. There are a few things that could be improved. We arrived to find we had to wash all the dishes in the dishwasher which were dirty. A note said that it takes too long for the cleaner to do a dishwasher cycle and visitors should turn on the dishwasher. However it wasn't a great start. Also the hot water for the shower seemed to run out after a few showers and the heater for the apartment is very noisy. Apart from this we had a great stay and the apartment is well appointed.
7003280,55746608,2015-12-05,48898930,Siavash,James made the checkin process very seamless which was great. I liked the neighborhood too. The place was also nice and cozy.

7003280,56334680,2015-12-12,43025718,Alex,"Die Lage der Wohnung war gut. Sehr nah an einer T Station, womit alles gut zu erreichen war, aber ich wäre dort nicht gern nachts alleine rumgelaufen. Für uns war es ein gelungener Urlaub!"

7003280,56938887,2015-12-20,18100151,Andrew,We had a great time staying in Boston at James' place.  The apartment was close to the metro and clean - which we we're happy with. James was easy to communicate with and provided us with 3 sets of keys which was helpful.  I would happily stay here again if I returned to Boston.
7003280,57135478,2015-12-22,24760763,Mark,"We had a lovely stay at the small but accommodating apartment in South Boston. Beds were good, place was clean and attractive, promised services worked, it was warm and cozy. Neighborhood is interesting:  equal split between student types, on the way up, and hard-used worker types, struggling; half gentrified and half neglected."
Had a great meal at the Polonia--genuine Polish restaurant--around the corner.,,,,,
Found parking 5 minutes walk north on Dorchester Ave.,,,,,
In beautiful weather we walked to the Museum of Fine Arts,45 minutes,from there to downtown--Boyleston,Copley Square and the beautiful public library,the Commons etc,dinner in Chinatown
We did not meet James,"but good communication ahead left us feeling well prepared--all worked out as planned.\"",,,,

7003280,59569658,2016-01-12,44178457,Ted,"Happy to have stayed at James' place for a business conference. Red Line was just around the corner, and got me where I needed to go. Check in was simple and easy, and James was responsive to all messages. The place was clean, cozy, and accurately described in the listing."
7003280,60043580,2016-01-18,32459743,Jessica,This was a great place. It was perfect for my weekend stay. James immediately responded to the confirmation with all the information I  needed to access the doors. The apartment was clean and comfortable. It is centrally located with just about everything. I was fortunate enough to get parking right across the street. The woman who came to clean the apartment just before we left was absolutely wonderful. She was so personable. I would absolutely recommend James and this property.
7003280,60680372,2016-01-26,41261894,Diana,"This was our very first time using Airbnb & James made it absolutely a great experience. He is quick with responding to any questions or concerns you may have. As well as very accommodating to your needs. He works with you & his apartment is very nice & cozy, it was four of us & it was just the perfect size. We had a great time staying there at our time in Boston. If we ever get the chance to come back to Boston we would stay at James's again in a heartbeat."
7003280,60938635,2016-01-29,8370990,Ryan,"Great place, perfect for what we were looking for.  Right across from the T, and a warm apartment to come home to."
7003280,61318857,2016-02-02,40640630,Katrina,The apartment was clean and comfortable.  My friend and I enjoyed the space to relax in the evening after trips around Boston.  The washer and dryer is definitely an asset for road warriors.

James was great at communicating and letting us know how to check in as well as letting us keep bags there past check out time if we needed to.  Great spot - highly recommend it.
7003280,62276572,2016-02-13,2052878,Eric,"James place is quite nice and very conviently located close to a T-station on the Red Line: no complaints :) If you are sensitive to noise, then 2 two bedrooms give on to a busy street, but earplugs did the trick for me. James was very helpful re getting around, etc. Cheers."
7003280,62705622,2016-02-16,28558429,Joe,"Excellent time here, extremely clean and tidy.  Very easy checking in and felt right at home"

Dunkin Donuts, Pizzerias, and many other places right by. About an 8 minute walk down Dorchester St to a gentrified area with nice bars and restaurants. Very convenient."
The apartment has been newly renovated and has pretty much everything you need,including a washer and dryer. There is even a really nice balcony and outdoor area to hang out.,,,,
Everything was great. However when we arrived there was an overflowing garbage can that had not been emptied. The floors had also not been vacuumed. However,that isn't James' fault.,,,,
"I HIGHLY recommend staying here if you want a taste of old school southie with access to what it's changing into. \"",,,,,

We had a great time there and would definetely recommend the apartment!"
7003280,65519662,2016-03-15,41190533,Mimi,"The apartment was very clean upon our arrival. We were provided with clean towels, hangers, and 2 sets of keys. The kitchen was spacious and had a coffee maker and French press as well as coffee grounds. Each bedroom is decorated nicely and the beds were both very comfortable and had clean sheets. It felt cozy and comfortable to be there."
7003280,65955498,2016-03-18,15759794,Julie,"Loved this charming, cozy place!  It was perfect for our needs (catching up with a dear friend I hadn't seen in years).  Very close to the T station, so easy to get anywhere you want to go.  One previous reviewer did recommend ear plugs, and I wish I had remembered that, as the noises from the street (kids on their way to school, traffic) started at 7 am and made it impossible to sleep longer.  But, honestly, the positives of staying at James's place outweigh that one negative (especially if ear plugs would negate it).  James was very easy to communicate with and was quick to respond to any questions leading up to our stay."
7003280,66057123,2016-03-19,53586471,Dominque,The apartment had a good vibe and the location was only a short walk from several food spots. Contacting James was easy and my overall experience during my stay was good.
7003280,66399812,2016-03-22,44119741,Jennifer,"Overall, this was a nice enough apartment in a convenient area. The rooms are a bit smaller than the pictures let on, but mainly the area in which it is located can be a little bit touch and go at night. Overall, the access to the train was great, but we had a tough time with parking and with some of the quality of the amenities."
7003280,66990415,2016-03-26,3125344,Sara,"We had a great stay.  The unit was perfect, James was very organized and friendly, the location was extremely convenient to transportation, and we loved it.  Thanks James!"
7003280,68701573,2016-04-06,3945191,Annegreet,We rented James' appartment to attend a conference in the convention center in Boston and his appartment was great for this purpose! It is located close to the convention center and nearby the Subway station. Furthermore the interior was fine and the beds were comfortable. The appartment was clean and well maintained.
James was very helpful,providing us with information and checkin was easy. Therefore I would recommend this appartment,"especially to conference attendees!\"",,,
7003280,69682908,2016-04-12,4767962,Lynette,Nice clean apartment as appears on website. Easy communication. Close to station...only a few stops to downtown.
7003280,70679892,2016-04-19,21383726,Kristin,"James was very responsive and quick to answer when we had a few slight problems arise. The apartment, in south Boston, was a few minutes from the T which was really convenient and there was a Dunkin Doughnuts within walking distance for morning coffee. Overall the experience was good and James was helpful when I had any questions."
7003280,71282401,2016-04-24,45660064,Christopher,"Was very great, the location gave wonderful access to Boston, transportation options were practically unlimited, and the host Jay was amazing if you ever needed him he would be able to help you"

7003280,74817186,2016-05-16,40708250,Brandon,Jame's apartment was great! The place was very clean and comfortable. It was great being so close to public transportation and having Dunkin Donuts and a small food store down the street. I have already recommended friends to stay here on their upcoming trip.
7003280,75053148,2016-05-18,5546401,Monika,"Apartment was as described, clean and nice, close to Andrew station, 3 stops to Boston centre. James responded very quickly, all information given in clear way, all easy to find out. Apartment has full equipment, coffee maker, laundry and iron. Thank you for hosting us."
7003280,75672358,2016-05-22,2559386,Danielle,"Our stay at Jay's apartment was great. His apartment was comfortable, cozy, very clean, and extremely convenient. I loved the lockbox option as it made checking in and out a breeze. As stated in previous reviews, the nearest T station (red line) is literally one block away, which made touring the city so easy!"
Nearby street parking is basically impossible to find at night,however,the 2 hour spots available right outside the apartment were very convenient during the day. We found a parking garage to store our car at about 2 blocks away from the Broadway T stop,which is only one stop from the Andrew station near Jay's apartment. I recommend using SpotHero to find discounts on parking rates.,,
"This was our first Airbnb experience and I would absolutely stay at Jay's place again next time I make it to Boston. Thanks so much!\"",,,,,
7003280,76799124,2016-05-29,27073559,Tri,Very nice clean place. The apartment is at a convenient location that helps my family to both enjoy my cousin graduation and Boston attractions
7003280,77923980,2016-06-04,64040439,Yin Shuen,"The house is warm and cozy with most of the things we needed. It was however, small and on level 2 and has only 1 toilet, so it was a bit inconvenient for a family of 4"
7003280,78942287,2016-06-10,36710670,Julie,Great experience! James was very nice to deal with. I had some questions for him while there and he was very nice and responsive. Great stay. Would go back. Thanks!
7003280,79456762,2016-06-12,5532642,Emily,"Positive experience. Well-located. Clean, modern, all necessary amenities. Coordinating arrival/departure was totally stress free thanks to lock-box. Timely and kind communication. Highly recommend."
7003280,80784960,2016-06-19,23679046,Tucker,"The apartment was fantastic and as described. The T stop is only steps away and provides easy access to the Red line (South Station only 2 stops away!), and the neighborhood feels safe. James made check in and check out incredibly simple and easy, and he was a great host. I highly recommend this apartment for anyone looking to stay in or near downtown Boston with 2-4 people. I can't think of anything negative to say because everything went as planned or better."
7003280,81181858,2016-06-21,76911016,Joe,I only had to wait a matter of minutes before having my request accepted. The rules were clear and reasonable.
The apartment was nice,clean and the perfect size for me,my wife and our two small kids. Beds were comfortable and we all slept well.,,,
On street parking was easy. Being a second floor apartment,our advice is to pack lightly; the staircase to the apartment is quite narrow (perhaps not by Boston standards,though).,,,
The only thing we were disappointed by,and this is quite minor,was the entertainment situation. Having small kids meant we were in early,the TV only gets broadcast channels and nothing in HD. Also,there are no package stores within spitting distance,so our plans to watch a movie and drink some wine were thwarted
Overall and excellent experience. Nice apartment,great host. Would stay again.,,,,

"Thank you for the great experience :)\"",,,,,
7003280,86919520,2016-07-18,2278392,CR Shay,"People and Apartment: James & Jay were awesome hosts. I arrived to meet Jay, who helps out with renting James place, and he was super welcoming. The place was sparkling clean, spacious for a 2 bedroom, perfect for 4 people (parents and siblings, or 2 neat, respectful couples) newly renovated, and spot on from the photos. - If you're not familiar with east coast apartments, it will seem small, but if you are, you will be very impressed by the amenities (washer and dryer, stainless steel appliances, new tile bathroom, new hardwood floors, central air conditioning)."
Rooms: The bedrooms were good sizes,beds were the same size in both (large),uber comfortable (everyone noticed how fast we fell asleep in them),and decorated invitingly.,,
Location: We drove everywhere and the location was fantastic. 8-20 min to everywhere,literally. Beautiful,clean,peaceful,quite,street/neighborhood
Parking: 1) If you can't parallel park well,don't drive in Boston. lol. 2) In the summer,if you get back to the apt before midnight,you can find at least 1 parking spot on the same block. Only once did we have to park more than 1 block away. 3) You need a Parking Permit nearly everywhere in Boston (for residence only) otherwise you risk getting a ticket (which we did -$75). 4) Overall,not bad. We risked it for 5 days and had virtually no problems.,
Overall: Our little family of four,all adults,loved our Boston venture. We would stay with James and Jay again in a heartbeat. It's experiences like this with open,warm,and communicative hosts like Jay and James that make Airbnb the undeniable choice for us every time we travel.,
Thank you James,Jay,and the entire Airbnb Team for validating such excellent hosts!,,,

7003280,87603424,2016-07-21,1380732,Nicole,"Clean, fresh, perfect size. This was for a quick trip with my Dad and I to go to a Sox game. We were having trouble finding an affordable 2 bedroom- but we found one! James was very accommodating because we had a somewhat early check in and he was able to let us check out a little later which really helped out (flights were until late in the evening). Shower was great, access to a w/d was great, my bed was suppppper comfortable, and the AC was awesome. I would say- yeah, there's some street noise at night. However we were out and about from morning to evening, and so we were exhausted and able to sleep right through it. If you're really sensitive to noise (i.e. not from a busy city) then you might want ear plugs. However, I didn't have an issue with it being from Chicago and... well, I was real, real tired each evening. It was a great stay and I'd recommend it to anyone! Andrew stop is a 4 minute walk, ubers are always close by."
7003280,87701068,2016-07-21,58660709,Patrick,"What an amazing place. I came out to Boston for a baseball game and wanted a nice place to relax after a day of traveling. This listing was all that and more. Cute little neighborhood, an awesome balcony where we had our breakfast and coffee in the morning. The house was spotless and the kitchen was modern with all the amenities you could want. The neighborhood was very quiet and I slept like a a baby.

7003280,95134713,2016-08-18,76682745,Christy,We had never stayed in Boston before. From the reviews Jame's place seemed like it would be perfect for our 3 days in Boston. It was perfect! We were traveling with our 2- 14 year old boys so we needed some room. This apartment had 2 nice bedrooms and the beds were very comfortable! There was a whole house AC unit...very nice when we needed it. We wanted to watch the olympics and there was a very nice flat screen tv!
We needed to do a load of laundry and it was nice to have that in our unit.,,,,,
James place is a short walk (like 4 minutes) to the Red Line which took us into downtown Boston within minutes! So you don't need a car!! We liked figuring things out on our own and really didn't need to call on James but he was definitely reachable if we needed him.,,,,,

The neighborhood looked a bit sketchy at night but it was fine and we were never really bothered while walking the 1 block to the T station. Parking took a while because I didn't know how to read the signs but a quick text to James remedied the situation. Overall we had a great time in Boston and the convenient location of our accommodation made our travel into the  downtown area super easy. Thanks James!

6343532,45391683,2015-09-02,37639511,Xinyue,"Brij is a great host and my family like his apartment so much! The location is great with quiet and beautiful neighborhood.  Everything in condo is well organized and clean:) We really appreciate this! It is also convenient to go to BC or downtown by taking the train. Will definitely choose to live in Brij's condo next time! Thank you, Brij:)"
6343532,45525106,2015-09-03,41815801,Thomas,"Went up with friends for the night and this was the perfect spot. Close to the T, perfect size for 5 (of us). Would rent again if I was in Boston."
6343532,45887311,2015-09-06,42485005,Mike,"Brij was very laid-back about hosting. We worked out check-in and check-out times together, and he was very hands off (in a good, respectful way). The description of the property is very accurate. The house was beautiful, clean, and located in walking distance from BC and downtown Brighton, as well as the T to downtown Boston. I highly recommend this property, and Brij, to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in the area."
6343532,46207554,2015-09-08,42498126,Grace,"I didn't get to meet Brij in person but he was very responsive via text. The house wasn't as clean as I wished to be. The trash wasn't taken out so the kitchen was smelly. The dining tables and kitchen counter top were filthy too. We had to wipe the place down to feel a bit more comfortable. There was also a big spider web in the bathroom which I found that to be pretty gross. I mean he doesn't charge cleaning fee so I guess you can't expect much. Location wise wasn't bad. 10 minutes drive to Cambridge and about 15 minutes to boston downtown area. We didn't see any public transportation around but didn't explore either. All and all, it's not a bad place to stay in if you'll be out most of your day."
6343532,47047023,2015-09-15,22562471,Ailish,Fantastic house in a perfect location... Just a stroll to Washington Street for all Brighton has to offer. House was even better than expected and mich bigger than portrayed in the pictures. The only one thing I would say would be the lack of dishes/cutlery. A very small thing but it was awkward when we had a breakfast cooked for 6 people but not enough utensils to eat it on or with. Overall a fantastic experience and I would definitely come back again.
6343532,47866242,2015-09-21,2518155,Aidan,"Brij was very communicative and able to host at short notice. The house is a short 7 minute walk from the green line, and a comfortable base for Boston. Any issues were quickly dealt with by Brij."
6343532,47928468,2015-09-21,2983809,Trung,Brij was very flexible with our schedule.  He is extremely quick in responding to any questions we have. The apartment is beautiful and as in the pictures.
6343532,48529838,2015-09-27,27238741,Lola,"Brij's place was super nice. Much bigger than what was expected in the photos. We had no issues, and found the place to be very clean and inviting. Only note would be that there are not many plates/cups."
6343532,48750211,2015-09-28,30940896,Hailey,Brij was accommodating to our late arrival and always responded quickly when I messaged him. The condo was very spacious and quite clean. The only thing I would recommend would be comforters on the beds as they only had a sheet to sleep with. I would recommend this place for large groups staying in the city.
6343532,49352753,2015-10-03,2301829,Rachael,"Brij was a great host. He was friendly and his communication was good. Coordinating the key pick up was easy. The apartment is huge and nicely decorated with plenty of space for 6 people, and is situated in a quiet and safe neighbourhood. This listing is worth the price if you have 5 or 6 people to fill it up."
6343532,49458895,2015-10-04,41825784,Alexander,Fantastic in every way. Great flexibility with check in/out. Super comfortable unit.
6343532,50238785,2015-10-10,40063834,Selvakumar,The place was pretty clean and calm. Great stay and amenities were nice. Highly recommend this place to stay.
6343532,51307445,2015-10-19,43697376,Bill,"The listing was accurate and Brij answered some questions we had the day we got there within a couple of minutes.  House was good for 5 guys, we brought a blow up bed.  The den was great for hanging out in.  I would go back, parking is a little bit of an issue, a lot of permit only, but we did not get a ticket so it was not too much of problem."
6343532,51738420,2015-10-24,43534453,Renee,The place was great; it had everything we needed. Brij was great to work with and was very quick to answer in questions I had. Definitely recommend!!
6343532,52053650,2015-10-26,38588338,Marea,"Brij was very accomodating with our check in time and helping us with a parking spot in the neighborhood.  The unit was more like a home than an apartment. VERY spacious and bright. About a 10-15 minute to amenities.....places to eat, a Whole Foods."
6343532,52456037,2015-10-29,47227082,Brian,"Condo is beautiful, well kept.  Walking distance to public transit. The host was excellent at responding to emails and text messages promptly. Thank you!"
6343532,52910673,2015-11-02,2732131,Serafina,"Brij was an excellent host!  He was very communicative and accommodating to our needs.  The space looks exactly like the pictures and is a comfy place for large groups.  The neighborhood is charming and walk-able, plus the place is close by public transit.  You might have to park a few streets away if you bring a car, but you can definitely find parking in walking distance. We loved our stay!"
6343532,53439829,2015-11-08,31317552,Wanyi,Brij was very responsive and even went out of his way to help me look for parking in the area. The apartment was very spacious and clean. Everything was exactly like how the pictures portrayed. I would definitely recommend staying here!
6343532,56129555,2015-12-09,36064333,Shuyang,"He is a very nice and patient host. My family stayed there for a month, all family members felt like being at our own home.  Beside, the location is so continent, in later days, my mom who cant speak any English can go outside and knew how to take the subway by herself."
"Thanks Brij. \"",,,,,
6343532,57038228,2015-12-21,48804088,Lidy,My experience was great. Brij was very helpful assisting us with parking and making sure we had clean towels. And he was very easy to get in contact with him.

6343532,74371306,2016-05-15,11343339,Gayle,"Great place to stay.  Brij was quick to answer any questions.  Convenient location, with a sweet little park close by.  The condo was clean and ready for us.  Thanks Brij for the flexible checkout!"
6343532,75908901,2016-05-23,6492637,Lynn,"We enjoyed our time in this apartment.  The location was perfect for us, as we were doing things at Boston College.  It was comfortable for the 5 of us who stayed here and it was nice to have the living room to relax in between events."
The parking is a bit of a challenge,as it is all street parking,but we eventually always found a spot.  Brij shared that the local residents did not aggressively enforce the Residents only parking,which was helpful.,,
We were  a little disappointed that the place was not as clean as we would have wanted when we arrived.  The kitchen appliances were very basic - oven and kettle only.  Brij kindly dropped off a small French press for coffee: a coffee maker and  toaster oven would be useful additions.,,,,,
We never met Brij,"but he was very responsive to our texts.\"",,,,
6343532,77416266,2016-05-31,68253500,Jiaojiao,Not very clean.
6343532,77833380,2016-06-03,22166826,Taylor,"Brij's place is great! The area is beautiful and very close to the green line T stop making it super convenient to get into the city. The local area is very nice too; several restaurants and stops within walking distance. The house had a ton of space and was perfect for our group of 3 then 5. Brij also provided some essentials like an iron that were very helpful. The only heads up I have to give is on parking. The visitor spots are from 8am-5pm 2 hour parking only. We left the car there all day and fortunately didn't get a ticket, but it could happen. I will say Brij was very accommodating in offering us the driveway spot."
6343532,80077856,2016-06-16,71702108,William,"All I can say is that Brij was a terrific host, very understanding to our circumstances, and his place felt like going to a home away from home. We consider ourselves lucky to have found such a welcome place to stay for our visit, a great neighborhood, perfectly located for everything we needed!"
6343532,81197299,2016-06-21,77129755,Clay,"\"No cable TV for those who need it, just Apple TV (which was fine for me, but not Mom). Brij hosted well, promptly responding to all messages. Huge spacious self-contained first floor of a two-story 100-year-old house in a \"\"young professional\"\" neighborhood. Direct bus to downtown"
6343532,83092106,2016-07-01,57045259,名字,Very comfortable house!More than expectation!The best choice in Boston. And suprisingly I found electric cooker and Chinese novels here. Strongly recommend others choose this house!
6343532,88299201,2016-07-24,29642813,Anders,"Brinj is an excellent host being extremely responsive and helpful. We appreciated the rapid responses he gave to us on all of our questions. It is easy to access Boston from the house. Also there are a number of good places (coffee and dinner) on Washington and Comm Av real close. The apartment is nice and spacious. It is slightly challenging to find parking, but we stayed there two weeks and most of the time we were able to find parking space close to the house."
6343532,89646208,2016-07-29,84926351,Linda,Brij's house is really beautiful and comfortable. We experienced the American style house. We have a great vacation there. The small problem is the floor wasn't clean enough for children crawling on the floor.
6343532,91035817,2016-08-03,32622363,Ravi,Great place and Brij was excellent in communicating and facilitating.
6343532,93363030,2016-08-12,82187129,Lesley,"Brij was very responsive and willing to get any kitchen supplies we needed.  The area was safe, quiet, and within walking distance to the green line.  We easily drove to Whole Foods and Trader Joe's for supplies.    We loved our stay and would go there again!"
6343532,94968469,2016-08-17,67577924,Pablo,"Brij was available, the house very spacious and calm. We loved the neighborhood, calm and nice while not far from downtown Boston. We definitely recommend it for a family of 6!!"

He answered all of my questions and concerns in a timely manner prior to arrival, and even helped me find a gym while I was there. The listing is accurate to the description. The home is conveniently located about 10 minute walk from the Orange Line, or you can take the bus that is less than 5 minute walk from the home. I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Scott for your hospitality!"
5801643,31490343,2015-05-05,1643733,Courtney,We had a lovely stay at Scott's home in Boston. It was an easy walk to great coffee and breakfast as well as the T to get into Boston. Neighborhood was great and parking was easy. Scott and his wife made us feel at home and were easy and available to communicate with. Their dog Clyde is awesome and added bonus to their great home.
5801643,32198601,2015-05-15,29236033,Nicolas,We had  a great stay with Scott. The neigborhood is quiet safe. Scott welcomed us very friendly. The place looks like the pictures. Scott did his best to make my stay comfortable.
The T station is very close,only 8 mn by foot. A very nice place very close to Boston.,,,,

5801643,32600332,2015-05-19,24642778,Meli,Scott und seine Freundin sind sehr sympathisch und hilfsbereit! Ihre Wohnung liegt nur 5 min von öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln und ca 15 min von einem guten Supermarkt entfernt. Es ist sauber und sehr gemütlich bei ihnen. Ich würde dort jederzeit wieder übernachten und hoffe sie bald in Deutschland treffen zu können :)
5801643,33340410,2015-05-26,3843574,Kashif,"Scott and Eliana were amazing hosts and certainly very chill and hospitable. Even though we had to cancel one of the two days of stay (due to personal reasons); they refunded the money right away without any issues. Overall, the experience was A class and one couldn't ask for more. Thanks Scott!"
5801643,34726367,2015-06-11,31306927,Sarah,"Our stay in Boston was an amazing experience highlighted by the friendly, courteous stay I had with Scott in his lovely home. It was a real treat to stay in such a nice place, with nice people and have private room with our own bathroom and be able to have a pleasant walk down to the train station to explore the city. Scott was incredibly helpful and welcoming and was the best host my boyfriend and I could ask for."
5801643,36245556,2015-06-26,15934938,Kun,Our experience in Boston is good. This neighborhood is quite and safe. Subway station is only 10minutes away. Our room is clean and we got everything we need. Scoot is really helpful and we had nice talk. Recommend couple or single traveler who want to explore the city!
5801643,38232075,2015-07-13,14797753,Alice,"The communication with Scott was great, he was quick to answer emails and texts. Check in and check out times were flexible which is a plus. The room however was quite lackluster. The pictures provided overly-flatter the house. A quick tour around the house and you realize the floors, kitchen, and furniture are quite filthy. Spatulas and knives with frosting and oil still dripping from them are laid out everywhere. The living room furniture although comfy, had a certain stench to it and just felt dirty. The most shocking part however, is the absence of locks on all doors besides Scott's room. If is quite unsettling knowing the bathroom door, as well as the room you will be sleeping in has no locks. P.S. air conditioning is provided as an amentitie on the listing, but it is not set-up; you literally have an air conditioner on the table. To re-cap, our stay here was fine, we had no problem with the host; the house was just a bit underwhelming."
5801643,39322268,2015-07-22,36429899,Seham,"Scott and his girlfriend were nice. The house is well located. We took a 5 min bus to Forest Hill station (orange line) which bring into town in 20 mins.  The bedroom have air conditioner, the bed is a Futon a little bit hard. It was nice to take breakfast and dinner outside on the porch."
5801643,39965616,2015-07-27,7263309,Alexandre Et Amandine,Nous avons passé un bon séjour chez Scott grâce à son accueil et à sa gentillesse (sans oublier sa compagne). L'appartement est situé dans une rue gratuite si vous êtes en voiture et à 10-15 minutes à pied d'une station de métro qui vous amène directement dans le centre de Boston.
Seul bémol,la propreté de l'appartement laisse clairement à désirer,surtout dans la salle de bains et dans la cuisine. Le lit n'est pas non plus des plus confortables.,,,
Malgré cela,"nous avons passé un très bon séjour à Boston grâce à Scott. \"",,,,
5801643,40818976,2015-08-02,38967607,Tai,Our reservation was accomplished with all the ease a professional service but with that special feeling that only comes when people welcome you into their home.  The neighborhood was beautiful and only a 15 min walk from the T. All in all a great time.
5801643,41636864,2015-08-08,20039322,Lucy,"\"Scott and Eli were very welcoming. The location was very convenient with a 25-30 minute commute to the city centre. Pictures aren't overly accurate, place is a more little \"\"lived in\"\" than the pictures show. However"

5801643,47071188,2015-09-15,39272771,Constance,"We had a nice stay with Scott.  The accommodations are great for the price and location.  It is close to the bus, or a quick walk to the T.  Scott is welcoming and his dog Clyde is very sweet.  JP is a wonderful neighborhood to stay for a visit to the Boston area."
5801643,47908032,2015-09-21,19649013,Mariarosaria,"Overall our experience in Scott's apartment was positive. Scott was very nice and reliable. He was quick to respond to our messages and available to wait for us in the apartment, because our bus arrived late. The house and in particular the room actually look quite different from the photos, but Scott was very honest in advising us of this before accepting our reservation. The room was simple and we enjoyed it, some renovation would make it even more comfortable (a new better bed and mattress would be sufficient to improve comfort a lot) but overall it was ok. The neighborhood is quite and the nearest subway station  is reachable in 15 minutes by foot."
5801643,49106069,2015-10-01,4363027,Ramona,Scott is a great host. We spent 3 days in his apt. and if you are looking for something reasonable it is a good option. Public transportation takes you downtown in about 30 minutes and the area is quiet.
We were exploring the city during the day,but when we came back at night,we always had nice chats with Scott. He also gave us good advice what to see/do.,,,
The only thing I would mention as a minus is the cleanliness of the apt. Here is definitely room for improvement.,,,,,
Before arriving I was in touch with Scott quite often with some questions. He always answered quickly,"very friendly and helpful!\"",,,,
5801643,51503958,2015-10-20,7821290,Gao,"Scott is nice and caring for his guests. When we told him, it could be a bit cold in the night, he brought us new cover right at the next day."

5801643,58217747,2016-01-01,27306276,Hannah,"My friend and I stayed at Scott's place for 2 nights and had a really lovely time! Although our stay was short, Scott was incredibly welcoming and kept an open line of communication with us before and during our trip to Boston. Scott's house is located in he most idyllic little neighbourhood and is about a 5 minute walk to the closest bus station (which takes you to the connecting metro stations)."
Scott has a pitbull named Clyde who didn't seem to take too well to my friend and I for some reason. He growled at us every time we came near him,but Scott has him under very good control,so we never felt unsafe - just something to be noted! The bathroom door also didn't shut which made showering in privacy a tad tricky. But again,not a big deal!,,
All in all,a really nice,"no-fuss stay. Cheers Scott!\"",,,
5801643,67668854,2016-03-30,5192944,Thibaut,"Scott was really friendly and helpful. However the cleanliness of the house was a major problem. The bathroom and shower were in a terrible condition. Bedroom was a bit better but there was a layer of dust in many places and we really think the bedsheets were not washed since the last guest. Additionally the location is a good 10 to 15 minutes walking from the metro that will then take you downtown in an additional 25 minutes, so don't think of coming back and forth to the house during the day. Jamaica plain is even further, as it takes at least 30 minutes of good pace walking to get to the animated area..."
5801643,68558841,2016-04-05,31460560,Anne-Marie,"Scott was welcoming and very helpful when you need help and gives you your space when you want to be left alone. He really made my friend and I feel at home during our short stay in Boston. Also, they were no problem with his dog or anything else. The neighbourhood is pretty chill, steps away from the subway (15 minutes walk or 5 minutes with the bus). I would definitely recommend staying with him for your trip to Boston!"
5801643,68978552,2016-04-08,59215853,Lester,"We liked Scott and his pretty home, especially the location. Scott is nice, easy-going and helpful. We did, however, not like the cleanliness of the house. This was a major disappointment. Not even the bedsheets seemed to be washed."

5801643,70606474,2016-04-18,6568042,Friederike,We had a really good stay with Scott and Clyde! Scott even got off work early to greet me at his home!
The house is in a domestic neighbourhood,safe,with cute other houses around it. It's a 15-20min walk to the nearest T-station that takes you directly to town. There is also a bus running only 1 min from his home,which we never took,because the weather was too nice.,
Clyde did bark every now and then,but he also came to collect his back rubs,which was cute.,,,
The room is good for two people and the bed comfy,though the place itself could do with a little attention.,,,,
All in all you should love dogs - as Scott doesn't fail to mention -  and Scott is a really nice guy to have a chat with. We had a good time!,,,,,

Clyde was extremely friendly and very gentle and well behaved- he loved attention too. The location was good, about 15 mins from forest hills station, and in a lovely neighbourhood. Would definitely stay here again if we were in Boston."

5801643,92658581,2016-08-09,49904807,Joanne,"Good location,  however there could have been more effort in regards to cleanliness. We understand it was a private house with no cleaning service, but the bathroom mat was extremely dirty and the living room smelled like a dog. This was fine since we spent all our time in the city, but I would like to inform future travelers.  My main problem was there was a noise and vibrations coming the basement or some place that woke me up several times at night which made my sleep unrestful. The host was friendly and I barely saw the dog. I liked the feel of the older house."

During our time there it almost felt like home, especially because we could enjoy the shady backyard on hot days and have occasional BBQs in the evening. The house is comfortable and cozy, and Vincent's paintings are awesome to look at. The neighborhood is friendly and quiet, a tram station is just 2 minutes away by foot, the freeway system 5 minutes by car. There are grocery stores, restaurants, banks, bars etc. within walking distance. The Neponset River Trail is great for exercise, beach access is a 10 minute drive."

They are great hosts and thought of everything that would make our stay even more pleasant. It is clear that they love their house and take great care of it. The neighborhood felt safe and quiet and the town has some nice shops and restaurants in walking distance. The commute into Boston is easy and quick and it was especially fun to ride the trolley that stops only two minutes from their house. At their suggestion we made a trip to the small town of Scituate, a fishing and vacation place on the coast, which was an easy and fun drive from their house. We would definitely rent from them again! Thank you Kieran and Vincent for sharing your house and your beautiful art."

4340110,80569696,2016-06-19,70698224,Shannon,All the reviews about this place are 100% accurate! Yaoming and his wife are both very kind and welcoming. I stayed for two weeks while I looked for housing and this apartment is in such a great location on Commonwealth! I prefer to keep to myself and they were very respectful of that. The room is very cozy and everything was clean. They always made sure everything was stocked up (e.g. toilet paper). They even had extra individual packed things for me like nail clippers (like you would see at some hotels).  This was my first Airbnb experience and I would highly recommend anyone coming to Boston to stay here! They genuinely care about providing a good experience!
4340110,84430017,2016-07-07,3616444,Laura,"Yaoming was really nice and helpful. He and his wife made our stay really comfortable. Apartement is as shown on the pictures, but the room is a bit small for two people."
4340110,85856681,2016-07-13,83075004,Susan,Yaoming and his wife were very welcoming and put me at ease quickly (this was my first Airbnb experience).  The location was fantastic especially if you want to be at the sports facilities at BU or dorms on West Campus.  The bed was very comfortable and room was very clean with nice extras just like you'd get in a hotel in case you forgot anything.  Thank you Yaoming for helping me with my luggage and for both you and your wife for welcoming me into your home!
4340110,86054911,2016-07-14,76852176,Elizabeth,"Yaoming and his wife were welcoming without being intrusive.  Yaoming met me downstairs within moments of my arrival and carried my bag up to the room.  When I inquired about an a/c unit for the room, he and his wife immediately set up their window unit for me.  Absolutely would recommend to any traveler headed to the BU area of Boston."
4340110,88591907,2016-07-24,58680388,Teck Huat,"The location is perfect for me attending my workshops at BU west. Good choice of cafes offering breakfast, supermarket and walkable distance to restaurants, many Koreans, and with Babcock metro stop right in front of the building."

I had a short stay with them, and since I was on a busy schedule, didn't really got the chance to know them, but I met them a couple of times and they were very friendly and informative. The location is excellent- right on a T station, so easy transportation to downtown or a walking distance to bu."

5990808,32366907,2015-05-17,25351618,Jessica,Perla's place was beautiful and in such a good location. Just parked for the weekend on the street and took the blue line into the north end one or two stops. No dealing with the traffic or tight streets of Boston. The porch with the view of Boston is nice to just wake up and take in the view. Quiet neighborhood by the water and definitely an up to date apartment with great taste in décor. Perla was very helpful when we needed and arriving and leaving was super smooth. Definitely will come back here to stay when I need to stay in the area again!
5990808,32767649,2015-05-21,18909125,Ben,"An amazing home in an amazing part of Boston. Beautiful views over the city and in a really pleasant neighbourhood too. There are also grocery stores nearby, as well as restaurants and a T-station, making it really easy to get around the city."
Perla is a fantastic host - we were made to feel very welcome,the apartment was in perfect condition and she's really quick with answers to any questions too.,,,,

5990808,33131132,2015-05-25,32003763,Julien,Nous avons très bien été reçus par l'hôte. Elle était disponible au besoin pour répondre à nos questions ou pour nous faire de bonnes suggestions (restos). Le quartier était magnifique et à 10 minutes de marche du métro. La vue du balcon arrière sur le centre-ville de Boston était splendide. Un cahier avec toute les informations nécessaires étaient laissés à notre disposition. Superbe place que nous vous recommandons!! :)
5990808,42514963,2015-08-14,30500020,Jean-Francois,Very nice appartment. Great place to stay!
5990808,44766552,2015-08-29,7392923,Valentina,"Perla is a very attentive and communicative host. The flat is a perfect solution  to stay in Boston: subway station at 10 min walk (only 2 stops from city center), wonderful views on city skyline and harbour, full equipped kitchen. Unfortunately we didn´t have the chance to meet Perla but the check-in went smooth. Perla´s place was very clean, tidy and easy to find and enter thanks to the instruction we received. Everything is exactly as presented in Airbnb. An extra point for the Piers Park just a street away from the flat. We enjoyed our stay in Boston and we absolutely reccomend to stay at Perla and Scott flat with no doubt!"

The info booklet Perla provided was perfect, everything we needed to know was in there. If there would have been anything else we could have reached Perla easily on her phone."
5990808,47379181,2015-09-18,41551094,Michael,"I stayed at Perla's place for three nights during my stay in Boston.  Her place was very nice and very clean.  The apartment itself was a bigger than I expected it to be, based on the photos."
The apartment is very close to the airport car rental area,which made it convenient to walk to the apartment from and to the airport shuttle.,,,,
The closest subway stop is about 0.7 miles away,which isn't bad - just be prepared to walk.  From there,it is only a short subway ride to the heart of Boston.  The area of East Boston that the apartment is in seemed to be quiet and safe.,,,
Perla was always  very quick to respond to questions prior to my stay.  I don't think I waited more than a minute for most of her responses.,,,,,
I would recommend Perla's place to anyone who is looking for a place that is close to Boston,"without having to pay Boston prices to stay there!\"",,,,
5990808,48293688,2015-09-25,9497271,Kenneth,Great host. The house was clean and had everything we needed to feel at home. Thanks for offering such a great stay.
5990808,49012037,2015-09-30,38126469,Bev,"Really nice apartment, accurate photos and appreciated the facilities and thoughtful inclusions. But we did find it very noisy with airplanes so close, as well as street noise given no double glazing so we wouldn't recommend it for light sleepers. We had a maintenance issue that Perla responded to very well and it was easy getting around Boston from the apartment."
5990808,49220092,2015-10-02,40116916,Amy,"We had a wonderful time at Perla's! The apartment was beautiful and the location convenient - just a short 10 minute walk to the airport. The closest T stop was only about 15 minutes away and very easy to use. If we are ever in Boston again we will be staying here. Thanks, Perla!"
5990808,50665704,2015-10-13,44253490,Bappaditya,The experience was tremendously wonderful. I would say perfection personified. Lot of detailed attention has been paid to the needs of guest. Me and family felt like a home away from home. Rooms were neat and supplied with more than sufficient clean beddings. Bathrooms were clean and had every toiletry item that a guest might need. Kitchen had all amenities and to my surprise all spices. We could actually prepare meals.
5990808,50930616,2015-10-16,38215749,Alexandra,"Отличная большая квартира на тихой улице, от которой за 15 минут можно дойти до метро и быстро добраться до центра. Все что нужно для проживания, красивый интерьер. На кухне есть кофеварка и электрический чайник. До аэропорта действительно можно спокойно дойти пешком. Следует учесть, что квартира находится на 2 этаже, и подниматься надо по достаточно крутой лестнице."
"Хозяева оперативно отвечали на все вопросы.\"",,,,,
5990808,51311390,2015-10-19,43967911,Kate,"Perla and her Boston hideaway was absolutely fantastic.  Four of us fit very comfortably in the apartment, a fifth could have fit on the couch.  You're within walking distance from both the airport and a T-station.  Although we didn't see Perla while we were there, she was very accessible by phone and email and happily gave us some tips of things going on that weekend."
5990808,52071910,2015-10-26,37994402,Av,The apartment is very large and can easily accommodate 4 people. Upon arrival the place was clean and ready for us. Beds were comfortable and sheets and towels are high quality.
On the down side,parking was a nightmare. We arrived on a weekend and it took us 20 minutes of circling to find a spot. Don't expect to park around the house on weekdays and allow ample time for parking on weekends. Also,the key was left in a key box. This may sound trivial but it took us around 10 minutes to get the box open and we were not able to close it again. The last thing you want to deal with while traveling is a stubborn key box. Owner really needs to find alternate solution.,,,
All in all,the place is in a decent location close to the airport,is spacious,clean and comfortable. Parking in really rough,"even on the weekend. I'd stay there again if they replace that key box.\"",
5990808,53845115,2015-11-13,12493394,Amber,"房子非常干净、非常安静,离海边很近,早晨或者晚上散步很舒服。 不远处有小超市、披萨店还有一家热情的美味的面包店,非常好。 Tat为房客想的特别周到,尤其是厨房设施,各种厨房工具和调料一应俱全,很适合朋友或者家庭旅行。 离地铁站不太远,但走路过去完全可以,地铁站出口有美式和中国快餐店,还有小超市和卖酒的小店,很方便。 我们很喜欢Tat家的智能家居设施,房间的温度自己调节,不仅可以节约资源还很方便。 推荐中国的朋友来波士顿可以住在这里,会有很好的体验"
5990808,57981312,2015-12-30,10932607,Mark,This was a last minute reservation and Perla made the process so easy!  The apartment was ready at the time committed by Perla and the apartment was absolutely fantastic!  Super clean and cozy too.  I would most definitely stay there again!
5990808,65610468,2016-03-15,59246235,Justin,"Lovely Home walking distance to transportation. Parking is much easier during the day than later at night. Home was very clean and welcoming with a cute back porch with some city view, and photos were accurate. Very easy communicating with host. Park and city view about 1 block away. We would stay again!"
5990808,66462544,2016-03-22,35826100,Amanda,"Came to Boston, MA for a vacation and completely loved it! The house was clean and well kept.

Highly recommend for a group of 4 looking for a roomy place to stay!"
5990808,67602079,2016-03-30,16543629,Jordan,"We didn't get to meet Perla personally, but she made sure that everything was easy to do from checking-in/out to getting to the T. We had an issue with the internet and she answered right away with a solution. The place is spacious and clean. Great place to stay if you don't mind a 10 min walk to the train everyday."
5990808,70215774,2016-04-17,45599593,Lee,"Sorry for the delay in writing your review, Perla has a great place, with a view of the harbor and city especially with its close proximity to the Airport it made it more enjoyable. Well stocked with extra condiments that we were not expecting. If we return to Boston we would book Perla's place again."

5990808,75145468,2016-05-19,61709561,Linda,"Perla was very responsive to all our requests. When we saw we needed Kleenex and more TP, Scott & she quickly dropped some off. Perla guided me to the Peapod grocery delivery service & the Buttery alcohol delivery service, making it so easy to have breakfast and snack foods available. She also had great suggestions for things to do and how to get around."
This location is great; within easy and safe walking distance from the airport rental car center and to the T stop,which is just one stop away from the Aquarium.  Because it was so close to downtown Boston,we did not feel the need to rent a car,except for a day trip to Cape Cod.,,
The apartment was clean,pleasant,and comfortable for four adults and a toddler. Surprisingly quiet,even with close proximity to the airport. Nicely supplied with cooking utensils and basic food supplies,(coffee,tea

Get a bus and train pass because there is no need for a rental car. Public transportation is very easy from this location. The back patio had a great view of the city and bay. The neighborhood was quiet and nice."
5990808,78541069,2016-06-07,62317167,Alan,The host was great at communicating with me the entire time post getting there and during my stay. The apartment itself was beautiful and spacious. Definitely made the trip that much better with having such a relaxing home to stay in.

The home is spotless and impeccably decorated -- looks like right out of a showroom, only homey and comfortable.  The soaking tub was a treat after a long day."
5990808,83953465,2016-07-04,19314813,Eric,The apartment was as advertised and Perla was very responsive to any inquiry. East Boston will be the next real estate boom town and they have a very nice pad. Perfect launch point for our trip to Boston.

There was a last minute addition and someone had to sleep on the couch and it worked out well.  It was like being at home.

We were able to watch a thunderstorm/lightening over downtown Boston from the balcony and it was awesome. We enjoyed being out there every evening. The kitchen was adequate and we cooked our breakfast and usually brought back food for dinner or reheated \"\"doggie bag\"\" lunches for our dinners. The bedrooms and bath were very nice. It was very hot while we were there and we juggled running the room air conditioners so that not all 3 were running at once. It was fun for our 12 year old grandson to stay in a older building and see the cool neighborhood"
We never saw or heard neighbors,it was a very quiet building and the two nights we had a rental car to travel out of the area,we were able to find parking on the street without difficulty. Otherwise,"we tried the water taxi and the \"\"T\"\".....both really fun experiences for our grandson. \"",,

Close to town, just across the bay. It does take a walk to the Maverick metro station, but I don't care this 10 min excercise through a nice neighbourhood. Unfortunately there aren't many nice restaurants in the area. Also limited choice in markets. But that will probably change in the near future. Perla is an angel. She responded directly to all our questions and everything was well-organised."

2227959,24599361,2014-12-31,24047554,Bryan,"Sally and her family (and cat!) were incredibly warm and welcoming. They very graciously lent us a Charliecard to use for transport around the area, and made their washing machine and dryer available for our use, which was a great convenience. The residence is near a lot of great restaurants and shops, and is only a short train ride away from the heart of Boston. Sally and Bruce really made an effort to make our stay as comfortable as possible, and we had a lovely time with them."
2227959,24801020,2015-01-02,9898255,Jessica,"I booked this room for a guest of mine that needed a place to stay, so did not see it myself.  Sally was helpful and kind, and the house was in a convenient location near the Green line."
2227959,24929739,2015-01-04,22996359,Pei-Yun,"Really really really friendly, loving, talkative, helpful family. The house is big and filled with pretty things everywhere, you can find paintings, photos, postcards on the wall, and a cute orange cat in the house. The family helped us know about where to go in city, and how to go as well with some maps and flyers they collected. We love the family, and will definitely stay here when we come to Boston next time."

2227959,25402539,2015-01-14,25740547,Ami,Sally and Bruce were great hosts. I slept so well! So much better than being alone in a hotel. Also nice to learn a bit about the neighborhood and who lives there.

2227959,25778764,2015-01-25,13578582,Julie,"Next time I am in Boston, I hope to be lucky enough to get to stay with Sally and Bruce again. I felt completely at ease staying with them, and appreciated their kindness and hospitality. Plus their home is located in a great neighborhood. Both nights I was there I walked around the charming neighborhood and ate somewhere Sally and Bruce told me about. I loved that it was walking distance to Whole Foods, too. I highly recommend this Airbnb accommodation!"

2227959,26073608,2015-02-02,11522265,Lola,"I really cannot say enough good things about these wonderful people! After I was literally stranded at their place, snowed in by a giant blizzard, Sally and Bruce rearranged their setup to accommodate me for an extra night, despite having another arrival who was scheduled to stay in my room!!!.  Not only that, I was stuck without any groceries whatsoever, and my generous hosts were kind enough to feed me! (In addition, Tom, the other Air BnB guest who arrived, was incredibly gracious! Tom allowed me to keep the larger, warmer room, AND he helped me dig out my vehicle!!!!  What a gentleman! Temps were literally in the single digits with an arctic wind-chill taboot!)  Kudos in every way!  They went above & beyond!"
2227959,26404131,2015-02-11,26779299,丽朱,"Sally kindly put us into a warmer room with closet, windows, desk and chair decorated by fresh plant and flowers.The house was less than ten minutes' walk to green line train and Whole Foods. Nice and convenient residential neighborhood. Sally was very knowledgeable of  Boston and travelling. Both of them were interesting and helpful. Sally even drove us to the bus stop for the bad weather. It was a great experience apart from the snow storm, and many thanks to them."
2227959,26953675,2015-02-22,27715292,Haerin,"I love staying in Sally & Bruce's home!  I was impressed with their hospitality! The location was perfect, close to both B & C green line, and downtown Boston. I can't help saying their kindness as well. They both are really nice. before I came to their house, Sally gave me helpful info about Boston, offered me bigger & warmer room because there were not any other guests, even though we booked smaller room. We had a good conversation every time we're at home, Bruce offered us a drive to Subway station! But if you don't like to stay with a cat, think again to stay their house!:)"
2227959,27185755,2015-02-27,14486826,Maite,"The place is comfortable, cozy and clean. Everything is ok. They're a nice  couple. Sally helped us each time we needed. The location is good, you're near the bus to Harvard and MIT and near the T train to go around the city. Although the freezing weather they made us feel at home."
2227959,27286915,2015-03-01,27793032,Courtney,"Sally and Bruce are wonderful hosts! Listing is accurate (room comfortably fits two) and they are very used to hosting guests and home stays. They were very flexible about arrival and check out times, and didn't mind at all that we were planning to come back late at night. Sally lent us transit cards and helped us figure out the T, which was great! With all the snow right now, parking would have been impossible so I'm really glad we left our car. Bruce even have us a ride back to BC where our car was parked, which was so kind. They also have a sweet, friendly cat!"
2227959,27518401,2015-03-06,27647404,Ahmir,"Sally and Bruce were extraordinary host, very hospitable, and super knowledgeable about the area. They were extremely supportive of my needs, helpful, friendly, and I'd definitely recommend their listings."

We loved everything about the rooms, as they were so clean and comfortable and our hosts treated us very well.  They are exceptionally friendly people who go the extra mile to assist their guests and ensure that they have have a great time in Boston.  We also love their amicable cat, Darwin, who appreciates a cuddle and pats on his head. He is the friendliest cat we have ever met and is a joy to have around the home.  If you are looking for a great place with character and excellent hosts, look no further than Sally & Bruce.  We loved it so much that we hope to stay there again tomorrow."
2227959,27726012,2015-03-10,4377980,Dongyun,"The listing description is quite right. The neighborhood is also very nice. There is  a good supermarket nearby where you can buy many healthy and interesting food. Sally and Bruce are really nice people. They are so easy-going, talkative and very thoughtful. They make the little room very cozy and comfortable, really like home. Although it is not big, but I think it almost has everything you need. I think it is much more comfortable to live here than in a Boston hotel."

Ils ont été flexibles sur nos heures d'arrivée et de départ. Super accueil et très gentils. Ne parlant pas beaucoup anglais, ils ont fait beaucoup d'efforts pour communiquer avec nous. Ils nous ont rendu service quand besoin. Merci pour tout!"

2227959,29796585,2015-04-12,30729809,Elizabeth,"Sally and Bruce were very helpful and patient as we navigated our way to their house, taking a couple of wrong turns on the way. During our stay, they were friendly and had a lot of suggestions for food and entertainment in the area. The room was exactly what we expected- just fine for one night near the city."
2227959,30145543,2015-04-18,14375342,Trey,"From communicating to traveling to Sally and Bruce's place, the entire process was very smooth. The place is a little outside Boston Common (25 minutes) but close to the T line and a Whole Foods. We just felt very comfortable in their house. The room we stayed in was cozy and Sally and Bruce were great hosts, telling us where we should visit but also respected our privacy. And we loved the cuddly furry friend. I definitely recommend this place and would stay here again!"
2227959,30389590,2015-04-21,28467366,Tony,"I stayed in Sally and Bruce's place for three nights to run this year's Boston marathon. This was a truly great experience. The location of their place is really good. A quiet and safe neighborhood with Whole Foods, many restaurants, and MBTA in walking distances. They really pay attention to what you need and let you feel like you are at home. The room is really clean and nice. I even had better sleep than I am in my own place becuase the neighborhood is so quiet. Really love it!"
2227959,30487082,2015-04-22,15653428,Jake,"Sally and Bruce were very welcoming and the location is fantastic.  The room is a bit basic, not for the luxury minded but the hospitality, location, and sweet orange tabby cat are the important features."
2227959,30616767,2015-04-25,11182413,Megan,"Sally and Bruce first made sure to be there when I arrived which started the experience off right. Sally was incredibly helpful with providing guidance on where to park, where to go, how to get around, even gave me her transportation card for me to refill. Honestly, they made it feel like I was staying at home and not travelling. The room was terrific for someone travelling alone very cozy. The cat they have was very sweet and cuddly. Neighborhood wasn't noisy, mostly full of college kids and families. I honestly couldn't think of anything to improve upon, this was a great trip and staying at this listing really just completed my experience in Boston."
2227959,31129555,2015-05-02,31226987,Greg,"Sally & Bruce were very welcoming. This place is exactly as advertised. You have a quaint, cozy room in their house. An ideal spot if you will be spending most of your time out in Boston and using this as a resting place in the evening. I fell in love with their cat, Darwin. Darwin slept with me each night. If you are into that and an ideal locale in Boston then this is the place for you."
2227959,31184169,2015-05-03,2000392,Michele,Everything went smoothly; I didn't stay very long as my son and I were heading out early in the morning. Room was very comfortable. Sally and Bruce were pleasant; had a nice conversation with Sally before I turned in.
2227959,31524807,2015-05-06,29492855,Ashley,"Sally and Bruce were great hosts, who were both very nice and helpful, but also respected our privacy.

2227959,31778672,2015-05-10,2000392,Michele,"As advertised, well located, comfy and cosy. I was visiting my kids, so didn't spend a lot of time at Sally and Bruce's; when I was there, I felt comfortable and welcome. I enjoyed conversations with them."
2227959,32005766,2015-05-12,11517141,Joseph,Sally and Bruce are very nice people. They made us feel very welcome. Sally had a travel brochure for us and even lent us a Charlie card. The price was right and their house is a short walk from the Green Line. Ride the C line! The little extra walk is worth it. I was a little surprised when Sally told us they were hosting an couple and the six people in the house were sharing one bathroom. A nice stay for one night.
2227959,32149456,2015-05-14,1850308,Emilia,"Sally and Bruce were both very accommodating and helpful. Their check in time was extremely flexible, which was great since we were driving in from Ohio.

Also, my boyfriend insists you should go just to meet their cat Darwin."

The accomodations were basic but comfortable, exactly what we were looking for. Felt like we were staying at a friends parents house or something. Sally was very helpful in providing us with directions on the best way to get to where we were headed that night."
2227959,32622361,2015-05-19,658629,Félix-Antoine,"Excellent host, very kind. They help us to get there (we get a bit lost) and give us plenty of information. Their cat is awesome. Great location (10 min walk to direct tram) :) Thanks"
2227959,32754557,2015-05-21,5145776,Gloria,"Sally and Bruce are really nice! We didn't spend much time at home because of our short stay in Boston, so we didn't meet them often, but they were always willing to give us directions and advice. The communication with Sally and the check in were very easy, everything went smoothly. As described, the room is small and basic, but perfect for a short stay. The bathroom is also quite small and it has to be shared with them and with other 2 people when also the other room is rented."
Five minutes walk to the Green line (then about 30 minutes to reach Park Street with the B line,"maybe a little less with the C) and a big Wholefood Market is just around the corner!\"",,,,

Bruce & Sally are very kind people who are willing to help you out during your trip in Boston. The room was nice and since you are free to use the kitchen you have everything you need. A great connection to downtown Boston which made it all a very good stay for a low price!"
2227959,37747778,2015-07-10,13575703,Fraser,We had a great short stay with Sally and Bruce in Boston. The property is conveniently located to the metro lines and we found the room very comfortable. They have a lovely cat and gave us very helpful directions and recommendations.

2227959,39541235,2015-07-24,37836961,David,The host was very responsive after I requested a reservation. We organized check-in procedures (showing up and at what time).
When we arrived,Sally and Bruce were very accommodating to our schedule. Besides letting us arrive early on the day of our check-in,they helped us navigate the city,recommended places to eat,and let us borrow a charlie card (cheaper MBTA costs). The internet was also great!,
During our stay,there was a cat. I'm allergic to cats,but the cat proved to be no problem as it mostly kept to itself. What little allergies I had were ameliorated by the windows we kept open that provided a nice breeze in our bedroom. The only thing I would keep in mind is that the room faces onto a road that is slightly busy. During the day,there was some traffic noise that might trouble light sleepers during a nap. On that note,they do have a second room available in the back of the house that you can rent separately.,
"Our check-out procedure was also very flexible. A friend of ours was late in picking us up. Sally and Bruce let us stay later than we originally told them. \"",,,,,

Après avoir joint à mes frais (roaming), on nous a fait comprendre que nous nous étions trompés de jour, avant de changer de version et que la chambre n'était pas prête. De l'argent perdu en parking, roaming, du temps perdu en visite. La chambre en elle-même est conforme à la direction et propre. Internet rapide et salle de bain propre. Attention cependant : pas de porte, seulement un volet à glisser, et chambre qui donne sur la rue et le salon."

If you have time, they are willing to share their experience with you and listen to yours. Second, the house is near to train, bus stop, Whole foods, and some Zagat-rated restaurants.

The bed comfortably sleeps two people, and was clean and comfortable. We had ample room to store our things for the night. Couldn't have asked for a better stay!"
2227959,43455763,2015-08-19,37277726,Paul,"The minute I left was the minute I started to miss this place. This experience was so nice and therefore I must recomand everyone to stay at Sally and Bruce. They are so nice and calm and friendly people and they would help you with anything they can. They'd also stay for a chat with you at 11-12 at night after a long, working day."
The place: For a full amazing experience in the summertime,try to book the room in front that gives you an incredible feeling. You can listen to the silence of beautiful Brighton while enjoying the coldish air of the night,so refreshing after a hot day.,,,
"PS: Prepare for the most cute and friendly cat in the world.\"",,,,,
2227959,44285311,2015-08-25,25776143,Siqi,"The house is in a very beautiful and convenient neighborhood, though you have to be careful about the address cause there are Corey Road and Corey Street which are in totally different part of the city in Boston. Overall we enjoyed our short stay. The room was exactly as Sally described. And she provided us with very detailed information about the transport."
2227959,44496449,2015-08-26,42126563,Bella,Bruce and Sally are really nice people! I had two big luggages and have to go to BU early in the morning; they gave me a ride to BU so that I didn't have to take T while struggling with those heavy luggages.

The room is ideal if you need a comfortable place to get a restful night after a long day of sightseeing and exploring the city.,,,,,
It is easy to reach with public transportation and was a great starting point for our adventures.,,,,,
"Thanks so much for having us! We had a great weekend and will always keep this trip in best memories!\"",,,,,
2227959,46386900,2015-09-10,37799466,Meiling,"It took a while to get to their place because I didn't read the instruction carefully enough, but Sally guided me there with patience. The house is beautiful and cozy, and the room is well laid out and u can feel the breeze from the window. They are really nice couple. Sally helped me a lot to plan my trip in Boston which enabled me to have visited all the highlights of Boston given only two days, and we had an interesting conversation. Sally even sent me to the T station and I appreciated that."
"Thanks a lot for their hospitality! Hope to see them again in the near future!\"",,,,,

2227959,51119788,2015-10-18,38672851,Sonya,"My daughter and I enjoyed our stay with Bruce and Sally.  The room was quiet with lots of windows and the bed was wonderful! We both slept 8-10 hours each night we were there. Initially I thought it would be louder since it faced the street and had all the windows, but in the late evening it was quiet.  Although it is quite close to public transportation, we took the hubway and the T, the hill can be a bit much after a long day.  I would stay again, it was a good location and price was great."
2227959,51349378,2015-10-19,45480810,Jennifer,"Loved staying here! Great neighborhood, great location, great hosts. This was our first airbnb experience and it couldn't have gone better. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Plenty of space for two in this room. Sally and Bruce made us feel very welcome."
2227959,51618664,2015-10-22,6204473,Marek,"Our hosts were not home on arrival but had arranged for sister/sister in law, Lucille to be on hand. Showed us around and also was kind enough to provide us with a Charlie ( transit ) card to kick us off for the day. We met up with Bruce that evening and Sally the next day. Both were really helpful and a delight to chat to. Bruce even took time out from work to drop us off to tourist spots the next 2 mornings. To us this duo epitomises airbnb...its real folk sharing their homes and their town with you..the visitor. They don't claim its a palace but it sure is friendly....If you have time, chat to them about where they have been and what they have done...quite a story."
2227959,51705871,2015-10-24,1960144,Christine,"Sally and Bruce were really warm and welcoming. They went out of their way to ensure we had everything we needed and Bruce even gave us a lift to the metro station.

2227959,52397046,2015-10-29,13203318,Sarah,"Sally and Bruce made me feel quite welcome -- although I was arriving when they were not planning to be back home yet, they left me a key, had a neighbor standing by, and phoned to make sure I was all set before I arrived. The neighborhood is a quiet residenbtial neighborhood and the location is a short walk to either of two MBTA lines into Boston as well as a bus line to Cambridge so travel is quite easy without a car."
2227959,52582974,2015-10-31,20356155,Colby,"Due to weather, we were unable to stay with Sally and Bruce, so I can't rate their BnB, but i CAN say with confidence that Sally was an absolute delight to deal with, and extremely flexible with us. We are definitely going to try to stay with them again next time!"

2227959,53084810,2015-11-04,45106610,Robert,When my fiance and I arrived we were immediately greeted with open arms and then shown everything in regards to the room and all the amenities. They even provided us with maps and a Charlie card to use to get on the local train system. The room was exactly as stated small but cozy and they even provided us with a space heater if we were feeling a little colder than the heat can fix. And since they did not have a guest for the next day they were nice enough to let us keep our car in their spot all day while we were in the city. I would definitely recommend for anyone else to stay and would personally stay again!
2227959,53200005,2015-11-06,22618071,Shuang,It's really a comfortable room. They are really sweet and it's easy to find the place. Very convenient to get there. We really have a good time!

The ad was very true to the actual room and location as compared to local hotspots. Sally and Bruce made it a point to respect privacy but also make us feel comfortable in their home as well. Sally also had a ton of material about boston to look at if you were stumped in trying to find things to do our where to eat. Very helpful and very considerate.

2227959,57453921,2015-12-26,48848207,Claire,"Sally and Bruce were very available and nice. The bedroom is also cute. However, there is no so much privacy because of the room's location next to the living room and a little bit far from the bathroom. Furthermore, as if the neightbourood is cool, the house is far from Boston Downtown (around 40min)."
2227959,58162950,2016-01-01,43126151,Taylor,"We love our staying at Sally&Bruce place! Hosts are very kind and willing to provide travel informations for us.

2227959,60506040,2016-01-24,7685880,Edison,"We arrived in the evening, and it was fairly easy to arrive there. Our host accommodated us with parking, which was especially useful. The house was warm and Sally and Bruce were especially accommodating. Upon hearing that we were tourists looking to explore Boston, Sally gave us a bunch of useful pamphlets and books on exploring Boston, as well as her personal experiences. Our room was well equipped and had a small space heater to ensure we were warm during our stay."
The neighborhood had many food options,as well as late delivery,which was especially useful!,,,
Darwin,their cat,was a very friendly cat,which is especially loveable.,,
If you are going to be visiting Boston,"I recommend staying with Sally and Bruce!\"",,,,
2227959,61065581,2016-01-31,38591868,Whitney,"Sally was very helpful! She explained the T (even let us borrow her card so we wouldn't have to pay cash), gave us helpful tips on restaurants & parking, and was very welcoming. The listing was accurate, everything was clean and the neighborhood felt safe. Only a few blocks away from the T. Exactly what we were looking for. Cat is cute too :) Only thing we wished we knew was how narrow the driveways are! No on-street parking, so our truck was a little difficult to maneuver, but we made it work."

2227959,63198225,2016-02-21,54792902,Jamie,This house is so cozy and adorable! I've also never met such a friendly cat. The rooms are neat. Sally is very helpful and nice. She lent me Charlie's card when I lost mine and also mailed me my computer charger when I forgot it at her house. The only disadvantage would be a long way to downtown Boston but it didn't bother me that much. This neighborhood is very safe - I went back at night all the time.
2227959,64115325,2016-02-29,55943088,Paula,I had a great time at Sally and Bruce's. I was travelling alone and they told me everything I needed to know about Boston and made me feel very much at home. Also the cat is very friendly. I would recomend staying with them anytime.

Omdat we later aankwamen dan gezegd, was Sally erg ongerust en dat vond ik van ons uit een slechte start. Maar dat kwam verder helemaal goed . We hebben eigenlijk alleen geslapen en gedouched, omdat onze dochter in de buurt woonde. Het bed sliep heerlijk. Toen ik ziek werd, deed Sally er alles aan om gelijk een dokter te vinden in de buurt en wilde ze er ook met mij naartoe gaan. Bijzonder aardig."

Tanto Sally como Bruce fueron muy atentos y cariñosos, siempre nos daban consejos, nos respondían dudas y además tenían en la pieza un montón de información para turistas.

Sally und Bruce sind sehr nett und zuvorkommend und haben sogar extra ein Paket mit Reiseführer, Stadtplan und weiteren Flyern zusammengestellt, was ich wirklich großartig fand. Außerdem haben sie uns ihre Charliecard gegeben, sodass wir günstiger in der Stadt mit den öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln fahren konnten. Man sollte aber beachten, dass es sich bei der Zimmertür nur um eine Falttür handelt, die recht dünn ist."

She was more than happy to help me out as I needed a place to stay last minute while I was trying to secure an apartment in Boston.  She was a proud and knowledgable ambassador for Boston and Charlestown and offered a lot of useful info on the area and what to see. Also, the room was quite and comfortable. Charlestown was fun to explore, and despite being so close to Downtown, it had a small town feel."

1445064,13257450,2014-05-23,264402,Anne,"My stay at Rosalia’s was wonderful.  She was very prompt to reply to my initial accommodation request and provided assistance throughout my stay.  Public transport is nearby or if you prefer, a 20-30 minute walk into the city.  Bunker Hill Monument is 5 minutes away...  a fantastic view of Boston, but its 294 steps up, phew!.  From here you can follow  the Freedom Trail in and around the city. The bed was super comfy - great, after a day of walking around Boston. Wifi was fast, neighbourhood, safe.  Rosalia is the perfect host - enthusiastic about her city, welcoming and generous with her warmth and friendship. Blackjack, her pet rabbit, is gorgeous.   Highly recommended."

Would thoroughly recommend staying with both Rosalia and Blackjack.
1445064,15124573,2014-07-02,6420393,Stephan,I had a really great time at Rosalias place. It was very easy to communicate with her before hand and the place was easy to find. The apartment itself is great. Very cosy place and a very friendly pet rabbit named jack. Rosalia is an incredibly warm and welcoming person that makes you feel right at home. The apartment is located in a beautiful part of town and very quite. It was rather warm outside when I was there but thankfully the apartment had great air conditioning and it was always comfortable inside. I now know where I will go if I ever go to Boston again.

1445064,17081032,2014-08-06,8558704,Chris,I spontaneously decided to spend some days in Boston and asked Rosalia to stay at her place. She immediately answered and accepted my request. Rosalia is very friendly and just a great host - we had nice conversations and she gave me tips about the places I should see in Boston and even for my following stays in NYC and Miami. The room (also the entire apartment) is very comfortable and clean. I absolutely recommend Rosalia's place.
1445064,17237853,2014-08-09,18188226,Noah,"Rosalia was a wonderful host for my mother for 3 nights as she visited us and our newborn. We are also Charlestown residents and given our limited space, wanted a convenient, safe and comfy spot for my Mom to stay. Rosalia's condo fit the bill. My mother had nothing but great things to say."
I myself had the opportunity to meet Rosalia and she was gracious and inviting,making my mother feel right at home.,,,,
For anyone thinking of visiting Boston,"I would highly recommend a stay with Rosalia. Her listing is close to everything in historic Charlestown and very convenient to Downtown.\"",,,,

When I arrived, Rosalia was very welcoming and we talked about this and that. Overall, the stay was a very pleasant experience and the apartment and room were clean, just as I expected after reading all the positive previous reviews. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Charleston."
1445064,17917689,2014-08-18,19987346,Covadonga,"Rosalia is a good, positive and eeasy going person. Her rabbit is very nice and does not disturb at all. The apartment is beautiful and confortable but I think is not perfeclty located, at night I did not feel confortable walking alone through these streets because there is no bars or people around."

Her pet Rabbit is very quiet and it took me quite a few minutes before I realised it was watching me curiously from under a nearby table!
It was a great stay,and is a perfect position to see the sites. If you're like me,and just in Boston for the weekend,then I can highly recommend Rosmalia's company,"and a great place to be based to hit the city.\"",
1445064,19804696,2014-09-18,21191205,Antonio,Rosalia is a very nice host and her place was very convenient. Would recommend.

1445064,20313403,2014-09-27,21502508,Alison,I had a great stay with Rosalia. She was easy to get in touch with to arrange arrival and was flexible by allowing me to keep my bag in the room while I was out sightseeing. The room was clean and comfortable and the house is in a great location. Easy walking distance to public transportation and sightseeing.
My one tip (this is not a complaint,just a tip); the walls are thin,so if you have to be in bed early or are sensitive to noise,"you might want to bring ear plugs. \"",,
1445064,20458806,2014-09-29,9787541,Jay,Rosalia is very warm and welcoming. She is very informative and generous in sharing what she knows. She reccommended restaurants to for dinner when I arrived and it turned to be a great choice. Place is clean and well organized as seen in the pictures. Neighbourhood is quiet and safe to walk. 10 min walk to the close T staion that will take you to downtown Boston in 5 min. I highly reccommend this place to anyone visiting Boston.
1445064,20626448,2014-10-02,9154275,Justin,"Rosalia was warm and welcoming as a host. She is a fantastic conversationalist, very smart, empathetic and knows a lot about the area. We made fast friends, even though I was leaving the next day. Her house is exactly as described, on charming street. Boston isn't known for easy access to parking, but even coming in late at night, there was at least a place to park within a 1/4 mile. Room was bright, towels and sheets were crisp, bathroom was sparkling."

1445064,20726061,2014-10-04,1903936,Andrew,"The room and space are as promised. Clean, organized and well located in the Charlestown neighborhood. I did not see Rosalia, but she provided everything that I needed for my stay to be pleasant."
The only problem,which I do not believe to have been at all intentional or normal,"was that I was unable to get into the property and was forced to walk through the rain with my bags in order to find a place to stay dry. I am disappointed that no attempt to compensate me for this very unpleasant experience was made. I waited to write this review in order to allow Rosalia the opportunity to make up for the unpleasant arrival experience. \"",,,

The condo is indeed sunny and quaint.  Catching the bus or taking a slightly longer stroll directly to the 'T' was a breeze!  (If you're planning on public transport -- buy a 3-day/week/month pass: they're invaluable once you start getting a feel for where you want to jump around in the city and neighboring vicinity).,,,,,
All in all,"I really just want to share my appreciation for Rosalia opening her home to travelers like myself.  She is very pleasant and a very friendly person to just hang out with. :)\"",,,,

Being a newcomer to Boston I knew nothing about the area and it's safe, quiet, ideally placed for the airport and exploring both the surrounds/ Boston/ Cambridge and beyond. I would certainly stay here again, Rosalia's a top host and makes you feel like you're staying with a good friend, she really went out of her way to make the stay enjoyable and easy."

We had great conversations and I can even now call her a friend, even after just 2 days. We even spent a night out on the town together, exploring Boston. I don't think my experience in Boston would have been as great if it wasn't for Rosalia. Thanks for a wonderful time in Boston Rosalia! See you and Jack again soon, hopefully!"

Truly a pleasure to have stayed with Rosalia during my time in Boston. Rosalia is all that you would want in a host; pleasant, friendly, accommodating, helpful and good natured. It was like walking into an old friends house. Such a great host. Rosalia made sure I had everything I might need, offered up her place as my own and made sure I knew how to get to where I was going. I needed some flexibility with my check out time and Rosalia was kind enough to consider and accommodate. Rosalia even took some time to show me around Boston and join me for my post-race celebration! Like I said, it was like hanging out and catching up with an old friend."
The flat,room,location and neighborhood is exactly as described and,as Rosalia will tell you,there are easy ways to get around from her place. Rosalia's place has everything you might need or is within short walking distance to where you can get it. Room and restroom were tidy,as was the rest of the place.

Since I was arriving when she was not there, she gave me detailed instructions on how to let myself in. Rosalia was also very responsive to me text when the cab took me to the wrong location. Tip for anyone who is taking a Boston cab, make sure you say its in Charlestown or better yet just use uber! I came to Boston for an interview at MGH and once Rosalia found out, she gave me several tips on renting in Boston (if I were ever to move)."
As for the room,there were maps and a book showing the history of Charlestown through photographs laid out on the bed. The twin bed was really soft and comfortable.,,,,
Finally Charlestown was beautiful! It is such an amazing neighbourhood that is full of history. I wandered into a 200 year old tavern which was minutes way from the place.,,,,,

Suffice it to say that, while I arrived entirely disoriented after a nasty run-in with U.S. Immigrations at Logan, her welcome (as well as Jack's, her beautiful rabbit's) was so calming that I slept beautifully in her cozy guestroom. The neighborhood was quiet and close to the northern end of the Freedom Trail, and I spent a nice day visiting the site in Charlestown. Thank you for your hospitality!"
1445064,40667319,2015-08-01,38996057,Rab,"Communication with Rosalia was easy as she was frequently in touch via email and text. And although she was out when I arrived she had left a note and sent email instructions for getting into the apartment. The apartment itself was very nice and had a cute rabbit running around, so great if you like animals like I do. The bed was very comfy as well. Rosalia was very knowledgeable about the neighborhood and recommended a great old pub - The Warren I think it was called - nearby. The Bunker Hill monument was also a short walk away too."
1445064,41592187,2015-08-08,17687395,Roxana,"Rosalia is a wonderful host, friendly and accomodating, and I had a lovely time staying in her beautiful and cosy apartment, which was excellently located both for the airport and the city centre. Rosalia was great at communicating from the moment I made the booking and throughout my stay. She gave me good directions to her place and while she was not there when I arrived she made sure I had everything I needed for the check in. I was welcome by the cutest pet rabbit ever, Jack, who just like Rosalia made me feel very welcome. He's happy to give you a cuddle but also stay out of your way if you prefer (although why wouldn't you want to cuddle the cutest fluff ball ever?!). I had everything I needed during my stay there, including numerous books and leaflets about the city, recommendations on where to go (Rosalia is very knowledgeable about Boston!) and the great company of my host in the evenings when we were both around. Rosalia is extremely sociable and easy to talk to, but also happy to give you your space if you'd rather keep to yourself. The room was exactly as described, very clean and comfortable, and made for several great night's sleep."
I would definitely stay with Rosalia again if I'm ever back in Boston and would not hesitate to recommend her great place in Charlestown,a beautiful,safe,conveniently located neighborhood.,,

1445064,44200489,2015-08-24,29447640,Whitney,Rosalia met me at the door and showed me around her pad. I was given a key and showed how to work the alarm and what to lock. She really helped me with my transportation dilemma which turned out fine thanks to Rosalia! The accommodation was as advertised and I slept well. My shoes made it through the weekend without Cracker Jack chewing on them also! The neighborhood was awesome with coffee shops nearby and Rosalia's knowledge of where to go was pinpoint.  Very quiet and nearby the T for easy access to downtown Boston.
1445064,45207712,2015-08-31,33457897,Mahir,Rosalia was a great host. The place was clean and as depicted. She was also very helpful in getting me around Boston. Would definitely recommend!

She has the uncanny ability to notice what you want and address the need, even before you realize what's going on! She also has a lot of life experience and is a great conversationalist, we had a very pleasing 4-hour chat over lunch/beer in a local bar - this is what AirBNB is about! Thanks again for hosting, I hope I can return the favor sometime!"

1445064,47936104,2015-09-21,44209668,Joe,Great Stay!  The only thing about my stay I would change is when I met Rosalia. It wasn't until I was leaving that we finally met and since she was so awesome I just wish I met her earlier. These things happen on short trips as I was busy.
The Charlestown area is awesome.  I visited the Navy Yard. Ate at the Navy Yard Bistro which was enjoyable. Followed by drinks at Pier 6 which Rosalia recommend. Great summer venue.,,,,,
For breakfast I walked to the end of her block and ate at the Grasshopper Cafe which I enjoyed.,,,,,
"I'd absolutely stay again. Rosalia was readily available to answer questions.  The room and apartment were as promised and centrally located in Charlestown. \"",,,,,
1445064,48878022,2015-09-29,16825214,Kent,"Rosalia was a super host. Her place is comfy, clean, and charming. She communicated with me via email, texting, handwritten notes, and talking in person before and during my stay to make things run so smoothly. Jack, the rabbit, was peaceful and fun to see. Enjoyed being in Charlestown - close enough, but just off the Freedom Trail. If you're going to Boston, Rosalia's place is a good choice."
1445064,49486334,2015-10-04,40081147,川Rochelle,"Rosalia is a very kind hearted host! When I walked into the room to see her tips and a welcome dessert for me, I felt my heart melted!"

The room is comfortable and Rosalia has everything you could possibly need during your trip to Boston (snacks, umbrellas, maps, vitamins, toiletries, phone chargers - the list goes on.) The place is easy to find, in a nice quiet neighbourhood. The Grasshopper Cafe is just around the corner. I had a really fun weekend in Boston - thank you Rosalia!"
1445064,71516128,2016-04-25,5088986,Raphaela,"Rosalia provided a very accurate description of her nice apartment, the room and the neighborhood. I enjoyed staying with her a lot, she's a very kind host, very helpful and communicative. She provided me with a wonderful list of 31 things to do in Boston/Cambridge. Rosalia was always very relaxed when I used the kitchen and stayed in the living room. She was also very kind to share basically everything with me."
The apartment is very well located,a nice bike trip along the Charles River to MIT and easy to reach downtown by foot.,,,,

"Definite would recommend to friends!\"",,,,,
2747654,14734465,2014-06-25,13936766,Shengyong,"My parents had a great time staying at this apartment. It is very well-located, which made it easy for them to explore Boston. The apartment was clean and well-maintained. Eddie was a very friendly host, and Ahmed made sure to install an air-conditioner days before they moved in, which was greatly appreciated considering the summer heat. There was some noise from the surrounding area in the evenings, but this is to be expected anywhere in downtown Boston. In summary, this apartment offered great value for money, and we would not hesitate coming back in the future."
2747654,14839135,2014-06-27,6470424,Tauneel,"Ahmed responded very fast and made it very easy for our Boston trip. I did not meet him. His friend Eddie got us into the apartment and not only showed us in, he helped carry the suitcase up and told us about places close by for food."
2747654,15885333,2014-07-17,470675,Edna Luise,"This apartment looks pretty much as advertised. The location is great, although it's quite noisy with the windows facing Tremont Street. Otherwise, the place was very clean, but the bathroom could definitely use some renovation. Communicating with Ahmed went very smoothly."
2747654,17698318,2014-08-16,17734780,Violeta,"Nice place, well located, near green and orange lines but needs a little cleaning and the towels could be replaced."

It's very close to the green and orange lines, so getting around was easy. Ahmed responded quickly to our booking request. His assistant Eddie was very helpful in getting us settled into the place and had some great suggestions about food and entertainment nearby."
As others have mentioned,"Tremont street is a bit noisy. Bring earplugs and you'll sleep well.\"",,,,
2747654,18616208,2014-08-29,12607735,Robert,It is a nice room and I loved the location.  Street noise quite loud.  The pull-out sofa bed is not comfortable and should be avoided.  I would consider staying again.
2747654,19102486,2014-09-06,564103,Vladimir,"The biggest issue abut the apartment is that Thursday through Sunday from 11pm till 4am it's impossible to sleep here – located on the ground floor of the building pizza and bar attacks lots of people, motorcyclists, so there're always a loud party and heavy traffic."
And a good leaning might be useful for the apartment.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
2747654,20011143,2014-09-22,14562007,Melanie,"This studio apartment was located very close to everything we wanted to do and see. The room itself was clean and comfortable, but the bathroom has not been updated and was very old and unappealing.  The noise from the bars and street traffic below this street facing studio were VERY loud and even earplugs were inadequate to subdue sounds.  FYI-The entrance stairs are very steep and there is no elevator.  Entrance and building hallways do not appear well-cared for, though studio was updated. On the positive side, Eddie was responsive to a couple of issues we had and resolved them quickly.  On the whole, we sacrificed appeal for convenience."
2747654,20214215,2014-09-25,21521427,Suraj,The apartment was exactly as shown. All of the appliances and utilities were in working order. Beautiful space. Only issue was the occasional noise from Tremont st. And even that is not enough to dissuade me from renting this space again.
2747654,20849534,2014-10-06,18590454,Josh,"Ahmed provided a great place, in an amazing location. As mentioned by a few reviewers it was a touch loud, but in all honesty it's a minor inconvenience for having such an amazing location. The apartment is within walking distance of everything and was extremely clean. All the essentials were there including kitchen, internet and cable tv. Really could not have asked for a better location in downtown Boston."
2747654,21773018,2014-10-23,8610618,Jules,It was very nice and great location. And to are surprise premium cable.
2747654,30737018,2015-04-26,4275743,Carolina,Great location! But the place was very dirty. There were holes all over the ceiling and walls. The windows are also very dirty and the air conditioner sticking out of the window covered in brown tape is not pleasant. During the weekend it is very noisy outside because of the central area the apartment is in. About a New York Pizza.
2747654,31486178,2015-05-05,32016073,Charlotte,"We had a great stay at Ahmed's. With this being our first airnb experience, we will definitely be doing it again. Everything was as described and the location was perfect! Walking distance to everything we wanted to do. As mentioned in some previous reviews, it is directly above two bars so it can get quite noisy, but we only noticed on the weekend really. So as long as your prepared for that it is an awesome apartment. Simple and nice and like I said, can't beat the location!"
2747654,31730660,2015-05-09,31743624,Tahisha,"The neighborhood was great and lively, perfect location near a lot of historical and shopping areas!.  I have seen reviews where past vacationers complained about the noise, but being from NY, I didn't mind it at all, I slept through the noise.  Eddie, Ahmed's assistant, was extremely knowledgeable about the area, and made us feel welcome upon arrival, would definitely go back!  The apartment was cozy, and provided all that we needed for the 2 nights we were there!  Thanks again Eddie and Ahmed!"
2747654,32007953,2015-05-12,401938,Brooke,"The other reviews of this place are fairly accurate - a great location, but the place itself leaves a little (a lot?) to be desired. A little bit of love could really improve the place. The curtains on the windows are very thin - there's a huge marquee light right outside the building. So bring an eye mask if you hope for a decent night's sleep. The bed is fine for 1 person, but not really comfortable for 2 people."
2747654,32511535,2015-05-19,10800434,Jiayi,"The whole check in process is pretty nice, Eddie meet us at the Penare bread accross to the apartment and help me to carry the heavy suitcase to the apartment! Big thanks, the location was amazing, but it's so loud during the weekend. Subway station is2 mins by walk, if you want a great location, this is No.1 choice"
2747654,32827303,2015-05-22,30648857,Chad,"Great location in the heart of Boston. Steps away from a T stop and the Boston Public Garden and Boston Commons. Apartment building in slightly run down but the actual apartment inside is nice. If you are a light sleeper, I would recommend that you bring a mask to sleep at night. It is directly across from a theater that for whatever reason has very bright lights shining all night. The shades do not protect you from the shine of those lights."
Overall,"it is a very convenient location.\"",,,,
2747654,33494876,2015-05-29,16443424,Michelle,"The apartment was exactly how it looked in the photos and for Boston quite large I thought. The bed was very comfortable. The only problem was that there is a lot of light coming from the theater across the street, which could be a problem for a light sleeper."
The neighborhood is interesting. On the weekends,its quite loud until about 2:30am then all noise suddenly stops. But it is a super convenient location. It is walking distance from three subway stations (Chinatown,Boylston,and Park St.),Boston Common is just up the street,and you have all the great food and nightlife of the Chinatown/Theater District all around you.
Overall,"a really great experience. \"",,,,
2747654,37336735,2015-07-06,33947899,Christy,"The place was exactly as shown in the pictures. GREAT location for what we were looking for! The assistant that met us at the apartment, Eddie, was prompt and friendly."
A couple of things that could have been better...Many of the plugs around the apartment weren't working. The only electrical plug that worked is the power strip behind the TV. Also,there was only about 1/3 of a roll of toilet paper in the place. There were some places on the wall that were patched up but that was no big deal to us. Overall a decent place to stay if you are looking for a small,"conveniently located place to stay in downtown Boston. 3.5 out of 5.\"",,,
2747654,40206644,2015-07-29,30658673,Marco,"when we arrived, we waited 20 min before entering in the apt. The stairs were dirty and the apt was very dusty. A week after, we fought against a giant beetle (we lost). The apt is small but is located in the center of the city, very close to the Boston common and the main streets. The japanese restaurant at the corner is fantastic."
2747654,40518388,2015-07-31,39042128,William,"There was not much interaction with the host, Ahmed, instead dealt with his assistant, and another associate was there to hand the keys. Overall, I would say the experience was average. I will give pros and cons."
Pros - Great location,close to everything; close to the subway,freedom trail,and lots of food options.  The sushi next door is decent. You have the whole unit for yourself and appreciated the cable TV and the two sets of clean towels.,,
Cons - Perhaps I am the outlier and unlucky,but the unit was not very clean - the   central rug had crumbs and clearly had not been vacuumed; the kitchen has some flies. The big issue was the bathtub was clogged and water was not running out. The host's assistant called the super,but he couldnt fix it in the days I stayed. The toilet flushed,"but also very slowly. That one may be due to the building being very old.  \"",,
2747654,40998440,2015-08-03,39190966,Donald,"Very nice and easy stay. Ahmed set us up with his assistant, Eddie, who met us across the street from the apartment, walked us in, and made us feel at home. Very great stay overall and would recommend!"
2747654,41831933,2015-08-09,13408614,Ng,"The location was good but the apartment is located above this tavern and when we were there for the weekend, it was really noisy. The noise continued all the way till 3.30am. We were woken up several times during the night so light sleepers may wish to take this into account. As per the other reviews, the lights from the theatre across the apartment can be really bright as well. Apartment itself is slightly old but has all the amenities you would need for a short stay."
2747654,42324618,2015-08-12,39822106,Liz,"Ahmed's assistant, Eddie, was really nice and gave me the keys/ brought me up to the condo. The building is RUNDOWN and so is the apartment. It is definitely not as fresh and clean as it appears in the pictures. The walls seem to have cracked in some places because there are white patches around that no one bothered to paint. I made the mistake of looking under the bed and there was a disgusting amount of dust. With the cleaning fee that AirBnB charges, I was really turned off. (It certainly was not professionally cleaned.) The threshold to the doorway has duct tape holding it in place and so does the AC in the window. It also smelled like cigarette smoke periodically. (I imagine due to a smoking neighbor.) Overall, it was fine and did the trick while I was in Boston for a few days, but it wasn't anywhere close to as lush as it appears in the pictures."
2747654,43273823,2015-08-18,6312754,Robert,"Place worked out great. Fantastic location in Theater district, although busy on streets below late on weekend evenings. Although an old building, everything worked and the little air conditioner kept room comfortable. Host was efficient and responsive and getting the key was a smooth process. Overall great value."
2747654,45391270,2015-09-02,38349838,Camilla,"Io e il mio fidanzato abbiamo soggiornato per 5 notti in questo appartamento. Eddie è stato gentile ad accompagnarci fin dentro l'appartamento. Ci ha anche consigliato alcuni posti dove mangiare o prendere un drink nelle vicinanze dell'appartamento. L'appartamento si trova al 1 piano (solo una rampa di scale). La posizione è buona, molto vicino alla stazione treni/bus (15 minuti a piedi oppure 5 minuti in taxi per 6-8 $) a circa 5 minuti a piedi dal parco pubblico e da una fermata della metropolitana. Ad a golo con la strada si trova starbucks ed un buon supermercato più vicino si trova a 10 minuti a piedi.Peccato che si trovi proprio sopra alcuni pub/locali che, specialmente nel weekend, rendono davvero difficile prendere sonno. Le foto della camera purtroppo non sono del tutto fedeli alla realtà. L'appartamento è spazioso ma le condizioni igieniche non erano delle migliori. Le lenzuola erano sporche e il bagno era in pessimo stato. Non riusciamo a spiegarci i 45$ di pulizia per cosa fossero.  La cucina è poco attrezzata, c'erano solo 3 pentole e una padella rovinata ed è stato molto complicato riuscire a cucinare. Poche posate e praticamente nulla di alimenti di base come olio,caffe etc. Abbiamo dovuto comprare anche carta igienica e sapone per piatti perché erano finiti. Nell'appartamento c'era la tv e il wifi che funzionavano bene. Il letto grande e abbastanz comodo. In stanza c'era l'aria condizionata fortunatamente, considerando che non era possibile aprire le finestre. Una nota positivissima è che l'appartamento si trova a 5 minuti a piedi dalla stazione di bike sharing HUBWAY, che ci ha permesso di visitare tutta la città in bici in grande relax! Boston è meravigliosa!"
2747654,45966396,2015-09-07,39195989,Rachel,My boyfriend and I stayed in this apartment over Labor Day weekend. The location is great! Right next to the Green Line and the Orange line and a little over a mile walk to the North End.
As far as location,you are right across the street from Emerson College's theatre and they leave their BRIGHT,Hollywood style lights on ALL night. The curtains in the apartment are cute,but very thin. I would suggest bringing an eye mask if you have trouble sleeping with light. The apartment is right next to some local hot spots for night life and over a yummy pizza place that's open late. So it can get loud on weekends.,,
Eddie,Ahmed's assistant,is great! He waited  over 1.5 hours for us! (We were running late from the airport). He was full of recommendations and was extremely nice.,,,
The apartment itself is pretty well maintained and you have everything you need. I felt safe and secure as well.,,,,,
I would stay here again in a heart beat!,,,,,

2747654,48078396,2015-09-23,9818010,Elena,Great location. Eddie the assistant was very nice and made checking in very easy. The room was not very clean and the cigarette smoke from the bar downstairs came in through the AC unit. The room is not ideal for a romantic vacation but it's fine if you're traveling on a budget.
2747654,48700250,2015-09-28,38653335,Michael,"Overall: We stayed in this unit from 9/24 until 9/28.  The description provided is very accurate.  The unit, as other reviews noted, is located on a busy street so you will get city noise (traffic, pedestrians talking, etc)."
Location: Absolutely fantastic.  Close to the Boylston and Chinatown Stations.  You can get anywhere from here in 5min walk. There is a Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts at the end of the block and decent Pizza joint right downstairs.  Boston Common,,,,,

2747654,51118846,2015-10-18,23540436,Ailen,"The apt is fine, it is as described an old building restored but with a good location. If you have trouble sleeping I wouldn't recommend this apt, we stayed there from thursday to sunday and there's a bar downstairs that gets really noisy til 2 am and you can hear everything. Also the theathers lights (there's one right across the street) can be annoying because the curtains are thin. Other than that Ahmed and his asisstant Eddie are very communicative and kind."
2747654,51474960,2015-10-20,2729726,Bruno,Mixed Feelings about this place.
Location is great in the theatre district,very central and in walking distance of a lot of places. And somebody put some effort into making this place look nice.,,,,
Unfortunately it's not very clean. Organisation was kind of annoying,Ahmed the owner can obviously never show up himself and has to send his assistant with the keys. On the day of arrival I am told that neither of them can accept calls or text messages from a foreign phone. Bad luck if you are a foreigner. Trying to communicate by internet while being on the road is a hassle,bad luck if you are a foreigner and don't have mobile internet in the US. Upon arrival,noone was there with keys,Ahmed writes he could not reach his assistant (!),so we had to hang out in the bar next door
"WiFi in the apartment was not working.\"",,,,,
2747654,51701594,2015-10-24,31120186,Ginny,"Text was the best way to communicate with my host-- once I texted him he immediately put me in touch with his assistant, Eddie. Eddie was awesome, very prompt in response, kind, welcoming, and very flexible in arranging a meet up to to exchange keys."
Once inside the apartment he showed me around and pointed out some things to take note of extra linens,heater,internet and cable setup. Then he began to list off a number of great recommendations in the area. He was very accommodating telling me he could be reached at any time in the event I needed anything. Luckily,I never came across a time where I needed anything in the apartment. My stay was very easy. Eddie did check in with me upon my checking out,again very kind! Thanks,Eddie!
The place was exactly what a needed for my time in Boston. Being a first time visitor to the area I knew I wouldn't be in my room a lot so I needed I didn't need anything extravagant. This place more than served it's purpose. The was comfortable,the pillows were awesome,and I was grateful for the extra blanket in the closet (I don't like heaters). I was exactly where I needed to be down town-- close to everything.,,,
I have to echo the previous reviews,although I stayed over a business week it still got loud in the evenings so knowing to bring ear plugs helped. Friday night was especially loud,but again I knew in advance,it's a city,it's happening place in the evenings-- pick up some ear plugs,no problem. The room is bright in the evenings however it didn't bother me but if you're a light sleeper and need total darkness-- bring a sleeping mask.
The apartment is old and generally speaking people tend to think old equals dirty. I was guilty of this but after further investigation the apartment was in fact really clean. Tub is stained and I instantly thought it was dirty and needed a good cleaning but I felt for residue and it was perfectly clean-- it's just old. I walked around the apartment barefoot and my feet were clean. Ran my hand across surfaces,pulled back sheets,inspected towels,all was perfect!,,
I would definitely stay here again,in an instant! The location was ideal (single woman traveling alone--I felt incredibly safe),the apartment was clean,"and bottom line it didn't break the bank. Thank you for existing AirBnb and making trips like this possible!\"",,
2747654,52233038,2015-10-27,18561373,Kate,"Great location, vibrant part of Boston and walking distance to most sights in Boston. Comfortable bed for two with our adult son catered for with a pullout couch."

2747654,55706990,2015-12-04,50171536,Marcos,"The host took my reservation on the last minute, considering my stay in Boston was extended by a couple of days. Having taken me in on short notice was very helpful. The host was made it clear about where everything was in the apartment and pointed out different venues and restaurants I could go to. The studio was very organized and nicely decorated. The neighborhood was very bright once the night came. If you're a night owl, it's very nice."
2747654,58815197,2016-01-05,22732631,Damien,"The description is very acurate. Nice place, nice spot in the city, but obviously the rest of the building is not as well refurbished as this. So you can hear all the neighbours in the staircase, and of course, as the street is lively, people outside."
Otherwise,as some others said too,it's not really easy to communicate when you arrive if you are foreigner. The wifi was really crapy by the way,"you'd rather connect to the new york pizza's one.\"",,
2747654,59493148,2016-01-11,2446605,Nikki,"The room was warm and conveniently located with a great view, and Ahmed was helpful once I was able to get in contact with him. I would suggest you get all of the details of check in perfectly squared away well in advance of your arrival or you might end up having to kill time while you wait to be let in. The hallways and stairwell leading up to the unit are a bit of a bummer; really dingy and a bit  smelly from the takeout place below, BUT the unit itself possesses none of those negative qualities."
2747654,68073815,2016-04-02,8267561,Me,Nice small and comfortable studio. Very well located as walking distance to harbour and aquarium and one block from Boston Commons. During our stay on Thursday/Friday night the street is blocked and lots of traffic of people going to bars. As well lots of police/ambulance going through so quite difficult to sleep is you are a light sleep sleeper. If you need to leave for the airport very early in the morning like us this is an issue as taxis are not allowed when street is blocked. We also had an issue with the bathtub drain but this was resolved within a few hours.
2747654,69905775,2016-04-14,50866410,Tom,"First I would like to day that Boston is an amazing town. I am happy we made the trip and got to experience a small portion of what the city has to offer. However, I was very disappointed in the overall cleanliness of the apartment. We arrived and struggled up to the second floor. More steps than we were led to believe existed. Both my wife and I are recovering from medical issues that limit our mobility. This was described when the reservation was made. We opened the door to the apartment and my wife about fell over from the musty and dusty atmosphere."
"The apartment had obviously been going through some sheet rock repairs. Patches obvious in every room. The dust from sanding these patches had not been cleaned up. The tile in the bathroom had signs of mold in the grout. Again dust and dirt everywhere. It was not cleaned after the patches we re e sanded. The bathroom sink and mirror were dusty and the hot water faucet ran at a dribble constantly. The ventilation fan grill above the sink was also filthy. I have never experienced such disregard for a renters health and comfort. Doubt I will ever use this host again.\"",,,,,
2747654,70080286,2016-04-16,53846998,Meredith,"The apartment was great!  It was an awesome location (right near the Green Line) and was easy to get to from the airport. All communication was quick and helpful with Ahmed's colleague, Eddie, and when Eddie wasn't able to make it for check-in, he had someone come right away to let us in."
Some reviews mentioned it was noisy overnight,but on a Thursday-Saturday stay,it was nothing too loud that we couldn't sleep right through it.  The lights across the street were more of a bother (but still,slept right through it) but that can't be helped- it depends on what the theater is advertising on their screen that day.,,
Great stay,"would definitely return if in the area again! \"",,,,
2747654,70465641,2016-04-18,39085154,Philippe,"The appartment is great for the price and did the job just right for what i needed. It's not a 5 star hotel room, the bed is not very comfortable, and the street is noisy, but it was clear in the description of the appartment. Very well located, within walking distance of many attractions."
2747654,71091129,2016-04-23,33745067,Claudia,"Ahmed was accessible by text messaging which made communication easy.  Even though we were late in arriving, his assistant Eddie welcomed us, and graciously gave us a tour, and the wi-fi password."
The apartment was as described,"an old building but updated with a nice kitchen.  We enjoyed being so close to the heart of the city and subway station.\"",,,,
2747654,71303800,2016-04-24,68450568,Johnathon,"The location was excellent but this place had it's down falls. The apartment did not appear to be the same size as the pictures or as nice. It was overpriced for its amenities and size. The noise was the worst part of the experience. There is an Irish pub and pizza place below the 12 foot window, which means there was a lot of noise between 2am and 4am. We were not warned or prepared for that after being exhausted from the day. My girlfriend and I finally fell asleep at midnight and we were abruptly woken up to sirens, people screaming, and horns blasting at 2am. The noise didn't stop until 4am. That was exhausting. Overall it was a great location to the city, the place was clean, but the place was overpriced for its noise/amenities."
2747654,71530870,2016-04-26,49954857,Abigail,"The description Ahmed has provided for this apartment is accurate. As he says, the building has seen better days, but the apartment has everything you'll need and is in an excellent location. We were able to get to everything we wanted to see in Boston on foot from this apartment."
The street is pretty busy and can get noisy,as some other people have mentioned,but it's not too bad. The apartment could have been cleaned to a higher standard,but it was perfectly serviceable and the cable TV package and living room area meant that a relaxing night in was an option,which isn't always the case in city Air BnB apartments. The biggest downside was that the bed was very creaky - not ideal if you're looking for a romantic break!,
Also,if you're driving into Boston,"you should bear in mind that there is no free parking in the neighbourhood - you'll expect to spend around $40 per day on parking.\"",,,
2747654,71754386,2016-04-28,35527796,Nicole,"Location was probably the best part of booking here. I stayed from 2 nights and 3 days and my friend and I were visiting Boston for vacation and sight-see. During our stay, we never had to use the metro once, but we still were able to get wherever we needed to go. In this location you have easy access to multiple food places and in a few blocks you can reach the shopping district. The place has working internet and TV with cable, another plus. The place was overall seemingly clean. Some things to watch out for -- no soap and conditioner so definitely bring some. Also I had a weird time obtaining the key. Ahmed told me to organize with Eddie his assistant to retrieve the key from him. But then I was called by an unknown number and found out another person, Kevin, (whoever that was) was to give me the key, but no one really told me and it was a little weird. But besides that overall stay was okay."
2747654,72807821,2016-05-04,51820638,Nicolas,Very nice location near the boston common Park and the center of boston.
So you can reach everything by walk.,,,,,
Kevin the associate of Ahmed was nice and reliable.,,,,,
However,the apartment was very very noisy,"the bathroom was dirty...and the bed wasn't confortable at all.\"",,,
2747654,74211520,2016-05-14,46943084,Carson,"The listing and photos give the impression of this BnB as being clean and stylish. In actuality, it's pretty tossed together and messy. Parts of the wall are unpainted, ceiling tiles are moldy, and there's a few cracks in corners, raising the suspicion that vermins could sneak through (especially possible given the location right above a cheap pizza joint). Most disappointing is the dribbling shower head, which provides an underwhelming shower experience. Still, for the price and easy walking distance to major attractions, I've seen worse."
2747654,74544053,2016-05-15,19932672,Jorge,"The listing description was spot on. Perfect location, old building but the apartment was very well kept. It was also a little noisy but you can't blame people wanting food after a night out drinking (you have been warned). One thing to note, the thermostat is locked and you will not be able to change the temperature. It wasn't an issue for me, but it can be during warmer/colder months."
2747654,75915710,2016-05-23,54215874,Arturo,"Very good communication throughout our stay. The apartment is fully furnished and was delivered clean, ready and on-time. Location is great."
2747654,76212536,2016-05-25,19908242,Vincent,"It was really, really convenient. Easy for food, sightseeing, almost anything. Also, some shortcomings exist. Wifi signal was not good. The bed and pillows were so soft... However, I would recommend this considering its price and location."
2747654,76435148,2016-05-27,63743710,Guido,"Great location and nice apartment, difficult to find anything cheaper in downtown Boston!"
2747654,77199898,2016-05-30,22664473,Josefina,The apartment has an amazing location but can be noisy during weekend because of the nearby pubs and bars. Clean and nice.
2747654,78627136,2016-06-07,53874027,Luís,"Receptividade do anfitrião foi enorme, um cara muito gentil."
A localização do apartamento é excelente,"do mesmo você pode estar nos melhores pontos da cidade (URL HIDDEN) certeza recomendo.\"",,,,
2747654,79675012,2016-06-13,64241220,Kristen,"We felt very welcomed by Ahmed and his associate.  Apartment is nicely furnished, clean, and although it is small, it is very functional.  I'll echo what others have said regarding noise levels...since the apartment is right above a bar it can get quite loud at night with street noise, yelling, and the occasional sirens blaring.  That said, you can't beat the location; it's a stone's throw from Boston Common and a 2 minute walk to the T."
2747654,80266459,2016-06-17,74495355,Mazen,Response to my request was quick and welcoming. The host was very flexible on check in time which I found very helpful given that I was on business travel and worked late.
2747654,81073548,2016-06-20,16578865,Eric,"This apartment is in an amazing location which can be good or bad for you. It's smack in the middle of everything however it can be a bit loud late into to the night as the apartment is directly above a late night pizzeria and pub. That being said, everywhere I wanted to go was easily accessible on foot or the T 1 block away."
I had an incredibly difficult schedule the day of my arrival due to meetings/other obligations and Eddie (the apartment manager?) made every effort to get me the keys. Everything worked out in the end and I'm very appreciative of his efforts in accommodating my crazy schedule.,,,,,
The apartment itself is super simple and everything works including the window unit AC and TV. Towels and shampoo/conditioner/body wash were provided. Shower head was a little weak but wasn't an issue. WiFi signal was also a little slow. I can see why other reviewers complain about the cleanliness of the building. The entryway and hallways in the buildings are old however the apartment itself was very clean and well maintained.,,,,,
"I would absolutely stay here again. Thanks very much Ahmed and Eddie!\"",,,,,
2747654,82052689,2016-06-26,43435843,Reginald,Thx I enjoyed
2747654,86990212,2016-07-18,4498110,Katie,"The listing description is accurate. As it specifies, the building is old, but the refurbishment is new. The apartment is comfortable and clean, and the location is wonderfully excellent. Arrival was made easy by the hosts, even though we arrived quite late in the evening. Great stay, many thanks!!"
2747654,88180138,2016-07-23,31124570,Pippa,Great location and everything we needed in the space! Only downside we had was the difficulty getting into the property - set up a definite arrival time ahead of time. Throughly recommend it as a base for exploring the city.
2747654,91466693,2016-08-05,80812154,Karen,Overall a great location! A little noisy but I knew that going in from other reviews. Clean and easy to check in and out!
2747654,91710235,2016-08-06,58112771,Chris,Very reasonably priced but communication was a little difficult and the restrooms could have been cleaner. Overall still a very good experience!
2747654,92452149,2016-08-08,47399140,Stephen,As described    no surprises here     great location
2747654,92656130,2016-08-09,12963985,Anne-Shirley,We've had a great stay in Boston! The appartment is tiny but perfect for one night. Truly well placed downtown Boston. A walking distance from pretty much everything.
2747654,95195887,2016-08-18,20020198,Stephanie,Easy check in/check out - Ahmed or his associate Eddie was just a text away if we had any questions. The apartment was very nicely decorated and much bigger than I expected it to be. Great location and a great price. The lights from the theatre across the street are bright - so bring a sleeping mask if you like it really dark =)
Overall,"a great stay!\"",,,,

13820571,87795685,2016-07-21,104567,Balliett,"Olena was a complete sweetheart. She was friendly, helpful, welcoming, and one of the most positive human beings I've ever met. We had a fun time parking my car in a tiny space and her home was clean and lovely. The bedroom was comfortable, cheerful, and bright. She also has a sweet little cat and made me delicious coffee in the morning, as well as some yummy cheese and salami."
Olena also taught me something beautiful,"and you need to hear it in her Russian accent... \"\"you stop to do","you stop to live\"\". Thank you",Olena,"for reminding me to keep going even when I don't want to. You reminded me of one of the most important lessons ever. You're an angel in this mortal world! :)\"",
13820571,88148744,2016-07-23,25181331,Reto,Everything was perfect! I stayed one night in Olena’s place. Olena was a excellent host and made me feel at home. The apartment is located in a nice neighbourhood very close to the airport. I would definitely stay again here!

She was very nice and attentive,"and that is a great value in this business.\"",,,,
13820571,89227433,2016-07-27,59516815,Ruyue,Olena is very hospitality and her house is very nice and clean. The location is rather convenient for people who wants to have a rest near the airport. I would definitely recommend to my friend!

The place is in East Boston close to the airport as well as downtown Boston and few minutes from the blue line subway. It is also very quiet. It worked out well for me since I had to be in downtown the next day. The place itself is very cosy,neat and comfortable. Everything was well setup in my room,"very effective central air condition and a clean apartment. Highly recommend the place.\"",,,

7562235,42049869,2015-08-10,16578722,Robin,"Camilla and David's apartment isn't fancy (it has only two small windows), but their hospitality is exceptional.   They made us feel like more than renting a room from them, we were their personal guests and they wanted to make us feel welcome in Boston.  They were always willing to share with us: a story, a recommendation, a meal, a walk, etc.  It felt like staying with a friend.  The apartment is basic but comfortable, clean, and cozy."
7562235,42488015,2015-08-13,2911365,Yuriy,"With the help of Camilla & David my staying in Boston was wonderful. First moment bedroom without windows could confuse you, but hospitality and friendship of these guys covers this lack with a vengeance. Clean room, nice location - recommend it!"

13275334,86712629,2016-07-17,79818619,Edwin,Alice was an absolutely wonderful host.  Her house  was warm and inviting.  The  interior décor created a very homey atmosphere.  Alice was always available to answer any questions we had about the area.  She gave us our privacy but was such a lovely lady we ended up having an amazing conservation.
The pictures seriously do not this spacious,cozy bedroom justice. The bedroom's décor created a warm  peaceful mood. The bathroom is located within the magnificent bedroom that was extremely clean  and spacious. We has full assess to a well equipped kitchen to make a quick meal on the go. The kitchen was airy,spacious and functional.,,,
Alice's house is perfectly located to explore Boston. Her house is 11 minutes away from the beautiful  Arnold Arboretum. As well a quick train ride to sites such as the Franklin Zoo (which has amazing walking trails,) Boston Commons,Newbury Street etc.,,,
Alice cultivated  a space that felt like a home away from home. I would definitely recommend her home to any of my friends and family. I encourage anyone planning a weekend get away to book with Alice. Trust me you will not regret it. I'm definitely booking with Alice again the next time I'm back in Boston.,,,,,

13275334,88169044,2016-07-23,15464402,Mélanie,Alice was a good host. She accepted our demand to stay at her place quickly. The room was very spacious and had a private bathroom. It has condionned air too. The bus was only a corner away and took us directly downtown.
13275334,89349895,2016-07-28,28296243,Sherrelle,I absolutely loved staying in Alice's home. It was a very last min booking. She was quick to respond and allow my friend and I to stay in her home.
The room had its own private bathroom and big closet. The room itself is very roomy and airy. It has central A.C and very comfortable.  It truly felt like home. We also had the chance to spend time with one of her daughters and roommate and the were so welcoming and friendly it was like chatting with friends you've known forever.,,,,,
(Her house is very beautiful and big.) Also if you are staying in the area and looking for places to eat river st. Has lots of different restaurants and small shops.,,,,,
It's not right in downtown Boston so make sure you can drive or get the bus. We didn't have a car so we took Uber and lyft around.  We were concerned at first about it not being downtown,but it was beyond worth the stay and we will actually  be going back to stay there again without a doubt.,,,,
"If you're looking for a place to stay this is it! The pictures don't do this space justice.  It's a awesome and clean stay.\"",,,,,
13275334,94355536,2016-08-15,57187604,Roman,"Alice was a wonderful host and the accommodations were more than as listed. Alice made us feel right at home from the start.  She was helpful, quick to assist when needed. She was just a message away. We met one of her daughter, she is very friendly and helpful too.The whole house is very nice, comfortable and clean. The room was large with comfortable soft bed ,great closet space and a big attached bath."
I highly recommend a short or longer stay with Alice.,,,,,
Alice allowed us to have an extension on our check out time that was a great support for us. Thank you so much,"Alice! We'll see you!\"",,,,

The house is in a cute residential neighborhood that is walking distance or an easy ride on the subway from anywhere you could want to go. I stayed there with five other girls, and we all had plenty of space. Finola thoughtfully left a map of the area with suggestions for restaurants and things to do, as well as a jar of instant coffee to make up for the fact that she didn’t have a coffee maker. That was something we definitely weren't expecting! By the end of the weekend, we had all fallen in love with Charlestown and Finola’s house and didn’t want to leave. This was the perfect location for a relaxing girls’ weekend, and we were so impressed with Finola’s hospitality."

To top it off, Finola was as kind and considerate a host as anyone could ask for. Upon our arrival we were greeted by croissants and maps of the city - along with great suggestions for where to stop during our stay! The rooms were very comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet even though you are close to the Main Street. The small terrasse in the backyard was perfect for sitting out to enjoy the sun and we were able to walk right across the bridge to downtown. It also helps that there is a delicious ice cream shop between the house and North End :) The weekend that we stayed was very hot but the air conditioning kept us nice and cool, any questions we had were answered in the Info Pack left in the mailbox. Finola responds quickly to any questions and goes out of her way to send updates on parking, events and tips for your stay! A perfect vacation from start to finish"
1587540,19974180,2014-09-21,8799182,Michael,"Finola's home was clean and cosy, just the way we expected it to be from the photos. Finola left us notes and instructions and thereby helped us to make the best out of our stay. Charlestown itself is another plus, since it is so close situated to downtown Boston and the beginning of the Freedom trail on Bunker hill. At the same time, Charlestown still feels like a small neigbourhood with a very homelike and authentic atmosphere. I kind of fell in love with this place: It made us feel home although we have never been to Boston before..."

1587540,28330141,2015-03-22,2359542,Rachel,"My husband and I just had a delightful weekend at Finola and Damon's house. We stayed there with another couple, each of us with baby boys, 9 and 11 months. Communication with Finola was prompt, friendly, and helpful. We  were welcomed with a bottle of wine  paper-weighing a personal note and useful house tips, instructions, and a map. The house was versatile, allowing each of our families to have personal space, while the common kitchen, dining room, and living room were more than adequate for us to spend time together. It was super useful that the home was baby-proofed for our crawlers, but nice that it was in no way over-run with kid stuff. The location was awesome. We had easy access to all of our planned activities in the city, and despite the cold, we enjoyed the charming neighborhood. We had a great dinner at the nearby historic Warren Tavern, walked to check out the Bunker Hill monument, and got groceries at the nearby Whole Foods. After Friday at 8 pm, we were able to find street parking without a problem. Thanks, Finola and Damon, for helping us have wonderful and memorable weekend!"

The location was really great and it was really easy to get to where we needed to be for the marathon. Finola was great to leave us with information about the area and also left some yummy chocolate for us! The house was nice and clean and had very comfortable. I am extremely grateful we were able to stay here because it was so perfect for what we needed.
1587540,37199155,2015-07-05,10215929,Katherine,"Finola was very accommodating. My family came in for the 4th of July holiday weekend and it was the perfect place for 4 adults (my parents, brother and his wife) and my 2 nephews. Plenty of space for everyone. This place is all about location - conveniently located near a grocery store (just down the street), Charles River, Museum of Science Boston, Freedom Trail, and all the attractions of downtown Boston."

Our boy had a great time staying in the child friendly bedroom.  The place is very modern but also cozy, just enough room for us to spread out for naps."
The neighborhood is centrally located,close to the North End and Cambridge as well as transportation on the T and Commuter rail.  I went for a jog along the Charles River,the greenway is perfect for jogging and very accessible from the apartment.,,,

Additionally, they left me a bottle of wine that I totally needed after two days spent looking at colleges with teenagers!!! I felt very welcomed and their house was a real gem.

There was no roku as advertised. The instructions were wrong in terms of setting up the TV . The TV never stayed hooked up to the wifi. They kept giving us incorrect Netflix passwords. A rep was supposed to meet us 3 diff times to bring by leasing paperwork (never had to deal with that before) but she never came only to show up unannounced on our third day. Also parking in this part of town is a nightmare. I wouldn't stay in a property managed by this company again."

It is every bit like staying in a college students room, but with Christine's friendly service and response time, we felt very good to have supporting this entrepreneurial spirit.  The apartment is within walking distance of the freedom trail and other tourist draws.  Parking is a little challenging, but it is possible.  There are many great noodle and dumpling houses in the area.  Great experience."

Sidenote: When I had to arrive late by a day due to unforeseen travel circumstances,he agreed to refund my 1st night,"and waited patiently for my rather late (midnight-ish) arrival.  \"",,,

Room is clean,bed is comfy,and the apartment is quiet,"exactly what I was looking for.  I will stay here again in the future!\"",,
3353,873726,2012-01-20,585873,Julian,Very comfortable and everyone in the apartment was ccol. Giuseppe is super friendly and helpful. The location is great and our stay couldn't have been easier.
3353,1004679,2012-03-15,1885474,Cherise,"Giuseppe and his roommates were great! They were very nice, and the apartment was in a quite area. It was a short walk to the T. The bed is quite comfortable."
3353,1040829,2012-03-25,1871847,Yang,"Giuseppe is a nice guy. He helped me carry my language when I first arrived there. Usually ,he was not at home and works a lot. There are three  roommates. One of them is a student in BU and he is a man of taste."
3353,1589889,2012-06-29,1840651,Juan Pablo,"Giuseppe was a very nice and cordial host, the room was a bit small but if you are looking for a private and afortable place to sleep, it was worthwhile."

3353,2401509,2012-09-24,3570699,Michael,"Very small, cramped room. Unfriendly host, who does not care about his guests. Had to go after him to get the keys to the apartment. No breakfast, not even coffee. Would not rent the room again!"
3353,2448170,2012-09-29,3458603,Steven,"Giuseppe was a great host, he made me feel comfortable right from the beginning. Location was great- right by the T station, markets and restaurants were just a short walk away. Great Location. Room was also comfortable. Private toilet and sink were clean and maintained. The apartment was very quiet and surrounding neighborhood is safe. I would not hesitate to recommend this place or stay here again."
3353,3094667,2012-12-15,4158014,Rory,"Guiseepe was nice and responsive to my inquiries about his place. It's very ideally located. The room is small, but it's accurately advertised. If you're looking for a place to just crash and plan on being out and about, this is a nice cheap option. There were 2 other housemates that I met and they were both very nice and respectful. I rented a car and so needed to park it 2 blocks up the street overnight and by 8a.m. in the morning you need to start putting money in the meter or move your car. Small inconvenience but not a big deal. Anyhow, the place was safe and secure and Giuseppe met me to give me the key for the place which I appreciated."
3353,3156444,2012-12-25,4446426,Stuart,"Stay exceeded my expectations. Great location, clean, and comfortable. I was able to reach Giuseppe anytime I had a question (wifi password for instance). The room is rather small but the price is right. Highly recommend staying here. It's a 5 min walk from a Green Line T stop."
3353,3293063,2013-01-06,3682236,Amerley,"The place was easy to get to and was in a seemingly pretty safe area. The room was small (as advertised!), but is perfect for a single traveler on a budget. Giuseppe was a really friendly and responsive host, had a great stay!"
3353,3593854,2013-02-20,4669362,Ana,"Nice room, small ( but that was clear on the ad) but clean, and it has a very confortable bed. The location was just perfect for me. The apartment is in a quiet street but very close to shops and Tube ( green line). Easy to get the keys from host. The guys are quiet and friendly, no loud noise at all. Would certainly stay here again if I need a place in Boston."
3353,8885717,2013-11-24,1988977,Kate,"Giuseppe was a great host, very helpful and responsive, cool guy."
The room itself was just what I was looking for,small but cozy,relatively quiet,fast wifi. It was nice to have my own sink in the room as well.,,
I stayed for almost a month,"and would definitely stay there again!\"",,,,
3353,10192583,2014-02-05,10644866,Mohit,"Before i say anything else i would like to talk about the host-Giuseppe. He is one damn helpful guy and is very responsive, who is always just a call away if you need any help. I was from abroad and it was my first trip to boston but i hardly faced any difficulty thanks to some really helpful advice from Giuseppe regarding the places, transport, restaurants etc. Talking about the room, it is pretty much the same what you read in the description. It has a private toilet(not bath) and a sink. The bed was very comfortable and i got some clean linen and blankets too. You dont get any furniture apart from the bed like a table or a chair and as said earlier its a pretty small room. The other room mates are quiet and are usually very busy, so don't be surprised if you are in the house all by yourself most of the times. Talking about the location- it has numerous restaurants which are just a couple of mins walk from home in brighton ave. There are a lot of places to eat and drink nearby. As far as transportation is concerned the nearest bus stops are just 5 minutes away by walking and as a student i had to go to longwood medical area everyday and had no difficulty doing it whatsoever. All in all the room and location were great and i had zero issues during 1 month of stay. I would recommend this to all those who are looking for a cheap accommodation in a safe and a happening location."
3353,11325459,2014-03-30,12324976,Magnús,"The room was all it was made out to be. Very small, but with a closet and storage under the bed. At the bedhead, a sink with mirror. Shared spaces were generally in good shape and reasonably spacious. Perhaps the only weakness was a lack of a vacuum, which meant that the carpet in living room became surprisingly stuffed with particles."
The host  was efficient and took pains to do a good operation. Often helpful,such as providing (an empty) metro card.,,,,
Unfortunately,it has proved impossible to reach him afterwards. It's frustrating,because I seem to have left something valuable. Repeated mails have gone unanswered.,,,
All in all,good value for the money,"but with some caveats.\"",,,
3353,26449280,2015-02-13,16226599,Amelia,"I really enjoyed my 1 month stay at this property. Although the room is very small (as specified in the description), there is enough storage space for a short stay, the bed is comfortable, and having a sink in the room was very convenient. The lounge area and kitchen are very nice spaces to hang out with a lot of natural light. The location is great, with the train station, a supermarket, bars/restaurants, and an amazing Asian food court just minutes walk away. Giuseppe and his house mate were really friendly and helpful."
3353,27467014,2015-03-05,27020124,Jie,"Giuseppe is a great and professional host that welcome his guest with warmness and care. everything is as described. The bed is quite comfortable. The room is small but have enough space for your luggage and personal belongings once they are taken out of the luggage. There are two drawers in the room, as well as a water sink so you can wash hands in your room. There is no desk and chair in the room,but that is shown in the photo of the room already.  The living area and the kitchen is large and comfortable, with everything typically you will find in those areas there ready for use. The bathroom is a typical one.  Overall I am very satisfied with my stay here and will come again in future."
3353,29122461,2015-04-04,27902813,Hilary,I really enjoyed my stay here. The room is nice and big and the bed is very comfortable. I didnt see Giuseppe much but he was always only an email away and was super helpful.  I would recommend to anyone and definetly stay again.
3353,37141039,2015-07-05,29726587,Shannon,Although not physically present at the apartment Guiseppe was always available on phone and email.  He was always quick to answer all my requests and to deal with any issues pertaining to the running of the apartment. The description of the room was quite accurate and yes the room was quite small which is fine if you are only planning on using the room for sleeping. I found the inclusion of a sink in the room to be quite helpful particularly when sharing a single bathroom with 4 others. The apartment had good access to grocery stores and public transport which meant that it was an easy neighbourhood to live in. The Apartment was a half hour T trip to the heart of Boston and a half hour bus trip to Cambridge during peak hours but a good budget option for visiting either of these locations.
3353,42870977,2015-08-16,4079054,Aline,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this place: the apartment is clean and spacious with nice common spaces for cooking, eating, and chilling. The bedroom was small, comfortable and definitely suitable for one person. The place is located within close walking distance of two supermarkets and various other shops, and a T and bus station are also very conveniently located and reachable within about 5 minutes. Giuseppe is a very fun and responsive host that was eager to make my stay as pleasant and smooth as possible. I can, without hesitation, recommend this Airbnb!"
3353,44996413,2015-08-30,41704990,Allan,Very good place. I recommend.
3353,52581468,2015-10-31,7936293,Joachim,I stayed at Giuseppes shared flat for two months. The room is exactly as described and i felt very welcome. It was like living in my shared flat at home. Everyone has their tasks and can use the whole flat. Giuseppe was very friendly and answered every question i had in no time.
3353,53873137,2015-11-14,35654413,Viviana,"My stay in Allston was great! The room was cozy, even if very small, and the house in general was comfortable. The flat is very close to the T station (green line B), so it's perfect for reaching Downtown and every other connection. Giuseppe was a good host, always careful and available. He wasn't always there, but Joana, one of the other roommates, was a perfect substitute. She really cared about my needs, and my content."
3353,66757891,2016-03-24,57950833,Whitney Ann,"Giuseppe was an excellent host, available and hospitable. He's the real deal. Everything went very smoothly and it was a great, quiet space.  It is in a great location with access to public transportation and any kind of restaurant you could imagine."
3353,71077701,2016-04-23,59699814,Alejandro,"Giuseppe es una persona muy atenta, que responde de forma rápida y cordial cualquier cuestión que puedas tener. Como dice en el anuncio, la habitación es bastante pequeña, tiene un lavabo, una cama y un armario. La cama es cómoda en cualquier caso. La casa es antigua, aunque está bien conservada y puede parecer hasta misteriosa (por ejemplo, tiene una escalera trasera para bajar al sótano). La casa está relativamente limpia, aunque al ser varios compañeros, todos tenemos que hacer nuestra parte para que siga así. La zona es agradable: la casa está cerca de Commonwealth Ave., una calle llena de tiendas, restaurantes, etc. y por la que pasa la línea verde de metro. También es una zona con mucha vida, ya que está al lado de Boston University y hay muchos estudiantes universitarios. El barrio suele ser tranquilo, aunque a veces los estudiantes que viven cerca (o en el mismo bloque) montan fiestas, por lo que en ocasiones puede haber bastante ambiente por la noche. La cocina es amplia y está equipada con todo lo necesario para cocinar, y aunque no dispone de salón tiene un pequeño hall con un sofá bastante cómodo. Tanto la cocina como el hall son lugares adecuados para trabajar, al no tener la habitación un escritorio."

3353,88284644,2016-07-24,53587021,Grant,Giuseppe was always there when I needed something and was also great company! I felt like I was right at home. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of parking... But it's Boston!
3353,96812289,2016-08-24,3803857,Mohan,"After having been a guest so many times in my life, I feel very strongly that it's the people who make the stay, more so than anything about the place itself. As advertised, my room was small and minimal---and Allston itself isn't the most upscale part of Boston. But none of that mattered much after being taken in and instantly treated as a regular old housemate. I quickly felt at home even though I was as far removed from my actual home as I could be. You'll do well here if you're a solo traveler who prefers to blend in with the locals, students, and young professionals without much fuss."
5639731,28444036,2015-03-23,24531688,Lauren,"The studio was perfect for a weekend stay. The house is on a warm, welcoming street close to shops, restaurants and public transportation. The location makes getting to anywhere else in the city really easy. Small room but homey and will definitely stay again next time I'm in Boston!"
5639731,28828211,2015-03-30,29318056,Berenice,"I like the place event thou you can hear everything at the building but I loved the area. The only this it was he had s little issue with the parking spot we payed, and it was very difficult to get in touch. Nothing happened big happened at the end, but it was frustrating not know what to do."
5639731,30114947,2015-04-17,5107301,Adam,"A great location, the room and the building were well-kempt, tidy and in a pretty convenient neighborhood. About a 15 minute walk to downtown, 5 minutes to Back Bay."
All was as described in the listing,and I was really pleased by the keyless entry feature (they have a pin pad for both the outer door and the room itself). It was a huge help when I got in late to Boston knowing that I didn't have to rush to meet anyone.,,,,
The room itself was fine,clean,a studio,but bigger than an average hotel room. It had a small refrigerator and microwave,plus some plates and glassware,which was helpful when eating in. The television also allows you to stream Netflix and Amazon Prime if you have accounts for them. Bed was very comfortable.
The only very small issue I had was that the water pressure in the shower was a bit low. It wasn't a huge problem though,the shower was still usable.,,,,
For future guests: make sure to bring your own toiletries (soap,shampoo,etc) for the shower,though towels are provided. Pay attention to the check-out details,you have to strip the bed and dispose of any trash. An easy thing to do though,"considering that I was paying a really good rate for the location. \""

Nevertheless access to the building and all prior informations were satisfying.,,,,,
The location of the appartment is quite good and suitable to discover the city. The room in fact is very small,especially for two persons with luggage. No opportunity to move inside the room if two travelbags are opened. Only one small wardrobe.,,,,
Cleanliness of the room and bathroom was ok. Background noise inside the building was disturbing at nighttime.,,,,,

I would advise future guests to get in touch with the company ASAP if you don't receive the info 48hours out from checking in. However, once we got to the place, the apartment was as expected.

801680,4076038,2013-04-08,5126916,Cindy,"Terry was an excellent host.  He contacted me several times before my trip, making sure that we understood how to get to the apartment, and offering to answer any questions.  He checked in with us a couple of times during our stay, and was also kind enough to let us check out late,when we had a last-minute flight change.  We stayed at two different apartments of Terry's, and both were very well-appointed and comfortable, with maps and local guides that Terry had put together.  The one-bedroom apartment was especially cozy & charming, as many vintage details were kept intact, and its heated with radiators instead of forced-air.  The only caveat I'd have is that visitors who are coming from out of the area need to be aware that although this is in Roxbury, it is adjacent to Jamaica Plain, which is a transitional neighborhood.  We (four women)had a couple of cab drivers tell us to be careful walking in the area at night; walking back from the T at night is not a good idea; daytime is fine (cab from Bostom Common was $15 or less)."
801680,5728667,2013-07-14,5776224,Katherine,"A lovely apartment. High ceilings, moldings, fireplace - loads of character and charm.  The apartment was very clean and comfortable.

It is very convenient to the T stop and parking on the street by the apartment was easy."

It was perfectly clean, amasingly furnished and spacious. Special tribute goes to Terry and his hospitality. He provided all the information we needed with his own maps and recommendations. We were going to Boston for a conference and I haven't finished my presentation (as it happens) so I asked Terry if he could arrange a computer  - and he did! He saved me - literally! Finally, the place is very conveniently located, just few subway stops from the main Boston atractions. I warmheartedly recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston. The only shortcoming is the fact that once you enter the apartement you don't want to leave it. So you may end up chilling at Terry's place instead of browsing around Boston :)"
801680,11228214,2014-03-25,12640280,Kelila,Very comfortable accommodations and plenty of space.  The place felt like a mix of a hotel and an fully furnished apartment.  Our daughter particularly liked the bowl of candy that was in the front hall.
One thing that we were surprised about was the tight spiral staircase that led to the bedroom in the lower level. This was not the most convenient for our family,but we made it work.  I called Terry right away to express my concern and he tried to help as best he could.  In the end we decided to stay put.  I'm wondering if we had be assigned the wrong unit,"because the one we stayed in was slightly different then the one in the pictures.   \"",,,

Whilst I understand that Terry did take action to get it repaired,it was very disappointing that this had to come at the expense of our sleep.

The road that the apartment was on was very quiet and a short walk to the T with easy access to everything we wanted to do in Boston.  Parking was free and readily available on the street.  The apartment was very clean and looked newly updated.  I would highly recommend staying at Fort Hill Inn."
801680,47750881,2015-09-21,34583247,Kris,Wonderful place to stay! Clean and quiet. Terry was very helpful and reachable.
801680,52868286,2015-11-02,42928516,Ruthanne,"Really enjoyed staying at Terry's . Not sure why people are saying it was sketchy at night. I was out at all hours and felt VERY safe, remind you I was with my daughters ages 11 and 20. Super close to the T never took bus walk wasn't anymore then a 5 minute walk."
Terry thankyou for having us. The bed and pillows made it hard to get up in the morning.  .Towels were amazing. VERY CLEAN ! There is not one thing to complain about except wish I could of stayed longer !,,,,,
Hope to be a guest again..,,,,,
Take Care ..,,,,,
"PS thanks for checking in on us as well!!\"",,,,,
801680,62910568,2016-02-18,54422306,Yilin,"Great apartment, beautiful and vintage style,  good location, easy to find a parking, the apartment got everything you need, fully equipped, we loved it, Terry was a really good person! He helped us to made the stay perfect.Thank you Terry"
801680,75937062,2016-05-23,70066162,Sean,"Our stay in Boston couldn't have gone any smoother. With keyless access to the apartment, neat, fully furnished facilities in cozy 19th century building complete with modern appliances, we were very satisfied with our stay."
801680,90456801,2016-08-01,67103564,Andrea,"This quaint 2nd-floor apartment was more beautiful than the picture represented. The historic building with a gorgeous fireplace and original brick accent walls made for a lovely setting. Definitely, we would stay again if Boston is in our future plans."
6400348,34233089,2015-06-06,13232828,Michael,"A very pleasant stay! Gloria made me feel welcomed and happily showed me around the apartment despite my late arrival. the location was great, very central with all you need a short walk away. There is a lot of room with all amenities needed for a nice stay. The rooftop area offered a beautiful view of the Boston skyline."
6400348,40276088,2015-07-29,30566555,Kevin,"Incredible location!  Gorgeous, unique home with original details.  Gloria was prompt and very knowledgeable, with great insider tips.  Would recommend in a heartbeat!"

8548176,48661773,2015-09-27,21823444,Alex,Juliet was very accommodating with allowing us to check in and out when it was easiest for us. I would definitely recommend this house and Juliet as a host
8548176,50533863,2015-10-12,19347946,Ruth,"The rental house on Kittredge Street was perfect for a family of seven, which included three grandparents, an adult couple, a teenager and a toddler."
The bedrooms have large closets to store suitcases. The beds and bedding are comfortable so we slept well. The bathroom is large with a window that we liked to keep open during showers. The kitchen and dining area had everything we needed. The refrigerator is big enough to hold restaurant doggie bags and pizza boxes. It seems that the toaster oven was the most useful appliance during breakfast and snack times!,,,,,
There’s a slide lock high up on the cellar door,which was handy to have with a toddler in our group,keeping the little guy safe. Down in the cellar is a washer and dryer,a handy combo when you’re away from home for eleven days.,,
The vacation spot is close to Logan Airport and it’s easy to get into downtown Boston from this location. Juliet left us a book with facts about the area. From this book we found out that the local restaurants are very good.,,,,,
The large SUV we rented fit safely in the driveway. It gave us peace of mind not to have to park on the street. By the driveway is a Concord grapevine loaded with grapes that we were encouraged to eat. The grapes were delicious.,,,,,
The neighbors were very friendly,smiled and waved as we walked through the neighborhood.,,,,
Juliet doesn’t live on the premises,but she did come by and was helpful with advice when we needed it. She was quick to respond to text and email messages as well.,,,,
"Our family of seven highly recommends that you stay at Juliet’s cute house on Kittredge Street. \"",,,,,
8548176,52164439,2015-10-26,35641026,Mikal,"Clean, just as described residence. Close to where I was working. More than adequate."
8548176,52563314,2015-10-30,13026775,Wayne,"I had an emergency need for immediate accommodations and within an hour of my request Juliet had responded.  The house was clean, spacious and very convenient to downtown Boston. The cost was very reasonable and the neighborhood was charming and felt safe.  I absolutely would stay here again."
8548176,53183358,2015-11-06,20105124,Wendy,"Juliet could not be a better host. This cute place is great and it is being made better with Juliet's nice design sense. It is a work in progress since she just recently purchased the house. Here's where she went above and beyond: She was having some improvements done when I was away for the weekend (and had planned to come back for a week). I realized that there might be a bit of plaster dust in the air, and I knew it would set off my asthma. I mentioned this, and without even a frustrated sigh, she put me in another house that day! It was so generous and it really demonstrated how she runs her business - she is flexible, an excellent problem solver, accessible and responsive. She also has great places to stay! Thanks, Juliet!"
8548176,53913412,2015-11-14,20105124,Wendy,"This was my second visit and it gets better each time. Great place, great neighborhood, great host. Highly recommended."
8548176,57368543,2015-12-25,42515526,Hu,Comfortable home for 6 (or more). Close to fantastic restaurants in Jamaica Plain and convenient to our Christmas Eve dinner in Roslindale. Host was responsive and very accommodating.
8548176,61717523,2016-02-07,56930976,Sung,"这个房子确实不错,价格很合适 大卧室很大,可以睡四个人 厨房的餐具很齐,冰箱里还给准备了水果。  great house with full cookers in kitchen and nice beds and sofas. A great place for relaxing."
8548176,62763267,2016-02-16,32718638,Joan,Great experience! Juliet was so quick to answering any questions that I had. The place was perfect for what we wanted and fit the description exactly. Had a wonderful stay here and would come again!
8548176,67236279,2016-03-27,18981615,Charissa,"Our family had a wonderful time staying at Juliet's property. The house was very clean and stocked with everything we needed.  There was plenty of room for our two families, and the four children loved having space to play.  Thank you so much, Juliet!"
8548176,68571474,2016-04-05,12124040,Paulina,Great host and beautiful home! She had a very helpful guide for anyone visiting the area. I saw her before I left and she was very nice! She also was extremely helpful when I left things behind to let me go and pick it up conveniently.
8548176,69073832,2016-04-09,25324130,Trevor,"We stayed here with some friends (4 adults and 2 three-year-olds) and the place was great for our stay, with plenty of space."
The house was clean and tidy,and we especially appreciated all the effort she put into making everything clear and easy-to-use: things were clearly labelled,there was a binder with house rules,instructions,tips,local recommendations
Our host,Juliet,was attentive and very responsive when communicating with us. She even went the extra mile and shovelled the drive for us before we got there (there had been a freak April snowstorm that day).,,,
As for location,it's about a 25 minute drive to downtown Boston,but it can be longer during weekday rushhour,so be sure to plan accordingly. It's in the suburbs,so there are all the usual amenities (groceries,"etc.) a short drive away.\""
8548176,69384567,2016-04-11,65637490,Hunter,"Juliet was kind enough to host our basketball team at her home for the night. We really appreciate her allowing us to stay as many people were uncomfortable allowing a bunch of high school kids to stay over night at their homes. I would recommend anyone to stay with Juliet. She responds to questions or concerns in a very timely manner which was important to me, she was welcoming and helpful to the fact that we couldn't check in until 10pm, plus all the directions and house rules were clearly stated which made things easier for us. Her house was very clean and spacious enough for all of us. Not to mention the house was in a great location. We were centrally located to all the things we would want while being away from home in a new area. Thank you Juliet! We will definitely be back again soon!"
8548176,70772132,2016-04-20,6755548,Christina,We stayed in Juliet's home during Boston Marathon weekend and had a wonderful time. Juliet was a great host and very easy to communicate with. We landed at the airport very early before check in time but she let us store our luggage so we could use the day to explore before check in time. I thought that was extremely kind and we are very grateful.
The house is conveniently located near public transportation so it was easy to get downtown. Her neighborhood is pretty great too! There were lots of little shops and cafes nearby and a large park that over looks the Boston skyline only a mile away.,,,,,
There was plenty of room in the house for myself,husband,parents and good friend. Juliet's home was decorated very nicely and everything was clean and labeled so there were no questions. There was even a handbook with maps and restaurant recommendations. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. There was a backyard too but unfortunately we didn't get to spend time there.,,,
We really lucked out with renting Juliet's place. If we come back to Boston,I would love to stay here again.,,,,

8548176,71412381,2016-04-25,67953241,Alan,"Juliet's home was clean, spacious, well organized and very welcoming.  The off-street parking was very helpful and it is a short walk to some convenience stores and a kid-friendly restaurant.  Juliet was a gracious host,  helping acclimate us to the neighborhood and answering our questions thoughtfully."
8548176,73105568,2016-05-06,69955482,Yonggan,Juliet document everything in details and easy to follow. It is a nice home and we had great experience.
8548176,76230155,2016-05-25,35393017,Weiqing,"This is a very beautiful and clean house. Juliet did everything to make sure we had a wonderful stay there. Her info book and notes in the house were extremely helpful for us to get to know the house and Boston area in general. It is definitely a perfect experience for us, and we will definitely stay here again next time! And we recommend Juliet and her house to every traveler in Boston!"
8548176,76409165,2016-05-27,73555453,Marc,"Lovely home with welcoming atmosphere, uninstrusive yet accessible host. Easy access, and a mile walk from restaurants. Would stay again!"
8548176,78719018,2016-06-08,10941776,Kathryn,This rental was for colleagues from out of town so that we could work for three days together. The house was adequate for our needs and Juliet was kind enough to let me stock the fridge at 1pm (check in is a 4pm) so I could run and pick everyone up from the airport and train. My colleagues enjoyed their stay and the wifi and tv worked well. I had thought we would be out early the day we were leaving and had told Juliet so on the first day. Unfortunately I forgot and we worked until 1pm the night before we were to leave and were still finishing up when she came early that day to clean. I regret any inconvenience we caused and we were out well before the check out time of 10am.
8548176,80860283,2016-06-20,72997575,Michele,"This was our first Airbnb experience. Went well!  The house was exactly has described. It was clean and quite functional. The host was responsive and available if needed. The beds were very comfortable which we appreciated.  Even the neighbors, who were celebrating a high school graduation, were respectful and ended the party at a reasonable hour.  We will be back!"
8548176,88764422,2016-07-25,78184458,Ashley,The home was very cute and we had  a wonderful time! Would definitely stay here again if in the area.
8548176,92977286,2016-08-10,35218380,Roxanna,"Our stay was amazing! The house was really clean and totally matches the description, the neighbourhood is nice and Juliet is really organized and helpful. Besides, we booked really late and checked in late, and this was possible thanks to Juliet's great organization. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this airbnb!"
8548176,93599948,2016-08-13,48443061,Na,"When we arrived Boston,it was too hot. If this house has air condition will be better"
8548176,96684850,2016-08-23,50220354,Franck,Juliet  was very nice with us. Her house was very clean.  The house is well located near Boston. The area is nice.
"It is just unfortunate that the rooms doors don't close. It is regrettable that there is no glasses of water. Some air conditioning would be nice.\"",,,,,
3311675,18841185,2014-09-01,20244428,Aamer,"The host was waiting for me when I was getting there and I took much more time than I had anticipated. I did not have a working phone for her to tell me or otherwise, but she kept waiting nonetheless. She did not show even the slightest but of irritation. Everything was expletives to me in thorough detail, which made my stay a lot easier. The rooms are nice. The neighborhood is in the better and safer parts of Dorchester, which is a big plus."
My room was quite clean. The kitchen had most appliances you would need to cook of you would like.,,,,,
I referred to am issue with the bathroom door,which was immediately fixed.,,,,
"I would like to stay there again. Well worth the price. \"",,,,,
3311675,40465808,2015-07-31,35556724,Rodrigo,"I wouldn't say that the owner made me feel welcome, I was just shown the room, given the key and very briefly shown the (dirty and smelly) kitchen and bathroom. I would appreciate if the owner left some real pictures of the surrounding neighbourhood (i.e. of very fancy Dorchester) so that future people are not mislead with pictures of the Beach - about a 15 to 20 minute walk from 1116 Dorchester Ave. Also note that the (very uncomfortable) bed only consists of a mattress on the floor. Another factor was the heat. I arrived during the hottest period in Boston, this as I very quickly found out was a mistake. The very small window of the room - where a piece of wood was used to keep it open - did not allow any breeze to come through. Which during the hot nights turned the room into a sauna. I hope the owner has the chance to clean the bed after the amount of sweat that came out of me!!! Providing a fan would be a big help."
I would also advise future users not to bring heavy luggage because you will have to carry it up - 3 flights of a very narrow,uneven and cigarette smelling staircase.,,,,
"But then again its less than $60 a night. Still it would be nice if the owner is more honest about the location so future users are not mislead. I tell you what I needed a large cold beer after I saw the room and the house because it was certainly a surprise.\"",,,,,
3311675,45709702,2015-09-05,39474991,Edmund(Sungwhan),"The owner, Henry came to the building on time to give the keys. Orichid gives fast response to message. The location of the building is great. It is close to Savin Hill station, close to restaurants and supermarkets. There isn't any washers and dryers, but there is a laundry place 100 feet away."
The building is old. The owner,Henry doesn't live here. They takes care of garbage,and bleach the floors. However,cleanliness is the biggest problem. I don't think they clean dusts in the corners. Inside the room,they do better job at cleaning,but kitchen and the bathroom aren't that clean.
I would recommend this place for short term,since the price and the location is convenient. However,I wouldn't recommend this place for long term. If they improve cleaning,"then it might be okay for long term.\"",,
13081347,77847515,2016-06-04,69080816,Matthew,"The room was neat and fairly large in a convenient location. The college roommates resident in the unit, though night owls, respected my sleeping patterns; in fact I hardly saw or heard them except when they opened the front door to let me in. Ann, the host, was responsive to my correspondence and last-minute booking, and accommodating in terms of check-in times. I would book again for lodging at this price point and location, although next time I'd bring a pair of shower sandals."

2943804,19823483,2014-09-19,4360703,Trisha,We had a great experience staying on Lola for 2 nights. The boat is very comfortable and in a perfect location to enjoy drinks on our deck and watch the sunset.
It was also an easy stroll to the North End and Freedom Trail sites.,,,,,
"John was very helpful and on call if we had any questions. I'd absolutely recommend staying on Lola as a unique way of enjoying a visit to Boston.\"",,,,,
2943804,35601255,2015-06-20,35427594,Justin,Staying on Lola was great.  Bob and Lynda (on-site managers) were great!  I was checking in late so Bob went down and turned on all of the lights and unlocked everything so that it would be easy for me to get settled.  He was always very nice and responsive if I had any questions.
If you've never stayed on a boat,just remember that things are smaller.  There was a bit of an odor but this is related to the raw water head.  The boat was stocked with everything you would need (dishes,towels,etc.).  The boat doesn't rock a lot because it's in protected water,but it does move some.  I was comfortable for the 4 nights I spent on board.,
The location is perfect as it is right in the North End.  Walking distance to the T is less than mile and is an easy walk.  Lots of good food in the area!,,,,,
"I really enjoyed my stay and would stay again if I have the opportunity.\"",,,,,
2943804,36298182,2015-06-27,11023260,Mario,"Everything was very accurate and communicated a way that made it easy to stay.

The boat is very comfortable, clean, spacious and fully outfitted with everything we needed. The air conditioning was a life saver! Communication with Bob was easy and prompt and our afterhours check in went smoothly.  Best part was sitting on the deck at night after we had returned to the boat and enjoying the view. The boat is in a great location - very close to the T, North End and right on the waterfront. We would definitely stay again on the Lola!"
2943804,42896378,2015-08-16,32124168,Alex,"great experience. Bob is excellent, very helpful."

2943804,51576077,2015-10-21,40548018,Elizabeth,Great location. Right near little Italy and the aquarium. Great accommodation. Host was easy to contact and the boat was easy to find. Highly recommended.
11990528,76620102,2016-05-28,15558375,Lucas,Great stay.  Everything was as described.  Communication was clear and we had no issues.

Make sure to visit the rooftop deck.  Thank you Larry.
11990528,78980779,2016-06-10,68235056,Paul-Isaac,"Amazing location. It was beautifully orderly, clean and Larry took great care of me (albeit vicariously).

Marian is a great host and the apartment is very comfortable, spacious, great beds and with a newly redone kitchen. The whole place is very clean. Great location near transportation so that the famous sites can be visited. Nearby in Jamaica Plain you can find restaurants, Whole Foods and the Samuel Adams brewery tour within walking distance. We did not get to walk around the pond at the end of the street and the nearby arboretum because it rained. You can definitely rent with confidence."
799701,30373827,2015-04-21,7004759,Krista,"Marian quickly responded all of my questions prior to my visit to Boston for the marathon and wished me good luck in the race! She went out of her way to ensure the house was prepared for my family's visit and left two contact numbers to call if we needed anything. Jamaica Plain is a little outside of the city, but Marian's house is not terribly far from a T station, which was perfect for commuting into Boston. My family felt like we were staying in a home away from home and are grateful for everything Marian did to make our stay as nice as possible."

250345,3319925,2013-01-10,2295113,Karen + Dan,Beacon Hill is a fantastic area to stay when visiting Boston. It is such a beautiful neighbourhood and close to Boston Common and an easy-ish walk to Quincy market.
Only downside is that we found parking our hire car overnight very difficult as street parking is restricted to residents.,,,,,
The apartment is spacious and clean,"with a great view from the roof-top terrace. Only wish we stayed longer than 3 nights.\"",,,,
250345,3354150,2013-01-15,4559461,Jack,"Beautiful condo in fantastic Boston location.   Staying right in Beacon Hill, its quiet but so accessible to all of the downtown attractions.   The condo was appointed, clean, just as the pictures display.    Having the washer/dryer was a nice extra we used, and the condo was fully appointed with most everything you'd need for a visit.    It would be crowded with any more than three people I would imagine, but just perfect for the two of us for a weeks stay.   Highly recommended."
250345,3666106,2013-03-02,1846444,Christa,"Unfortunately our stay at this apartment started off badly. We arrived in the early evening only to discover that it had not been cleaned from previous guests. The bed was unmade, there were used towels in the bathroom, the bins had rubbish in them and the carpets were dirty and in need of a vacuuming. I rang Seamless Transition immediately but no-one answered the phone and so I left a message advising of the state of the apartment and asked them to call my sister in law who lived in Boston as we had no phone at the time. The next morning we got no response despite my phone message and a email I had sent. My sister in law finally rang them and they apologized saying they would organize a cleaner immediately. To their credit, we were given a refund of 1 nights accommodation (through negotiations with airbnb) but we were disappointed that at no time did they contact us to apologise. The apartment itself was fine, well appointed (apart from a bedside lamp not working due to loose wires and a hopeless wireless internet that involved having to login every time you used it, would also not work on mobile devices). The apartment was in a fantastic location with many restaurants and cafes nearby. Boston Common was also close by, as was the subway. The only other disappointment was the lack of information in the apartment about the Boston area, there was none. The cleaner also turned up a day earlier than check out to clean the apartment so it seems there are a few issues around communication with the cleaners."
250345,4359175,2013-04-30,4967822,Wille,"This Place was Beautiful! The Location, Great! I had the Best Time due to having this Place Thank You so very Much... And the DECK was Phenomenal to say the least."

250345,6880761,2013-08-28,7837740,Julie,"We loved this place.  It was the perfect city get-away spot for us.  We actually live just outside Boston and wanted to experience Beacon Hill for a long weekend.  You really can't beat the location or the space itself. Very cozy, yet elegant, and comfortable.  A real gem!"
250345,7719286,2013-09-30,3463384,Marc,"The apartment is spacious for Beacon Hill and has an amazing location around the corner from Toscana, Paramount, and Figs. The two floor layout means you won't feel cramped, and the kitchen is functional. Plus I loved the grill on the rooftop. Also, the internet connection was reliable, which was important to me since I was traveling on business."
The only downside: the place was not clean when I arrived.  The bed was unmade,the trash had not been taken out,etc. The property management corrected the issue within about three hours of my arrival,and offered to strike 50% off my first night's stay. Once the apartment had been professionally cleaned I felt like it did meet my standards.,,
Even with the cleaning hiccup,"I plan to stay here again. It's great value for the money considering the Beacon Hill location.\"",,,,

The neighborhood was fantastic, to be on Beacon Hill with all the charm and things to do was just great.  The apartment was comfortable and the roof deck just added to our enjoyment."

250345,47298075,2015-09-17,43180561,Kyla,"The host made me feel extremely welcome and was very prompt with communication and email replies.  The place was modern and clean on the inside and had the old charm of Bostons beautiful brownstone neighborhood on the outside. The penthouse had everything you need or expected in an apartment. With the most lovely deck,  and fantastic views!  I  was actually very sad to leave! It's such a special place, in a bubbling little neighborhood.  I would come back here in a second!! Thank you!"
250345,49420935,2015-10-04,28830966,Violet,"Inn Boston Reservations were SO helpful in answering any questions or bringing us things we needed.  They even mailed us back 3 pr. of my husband's pants that I forgot in the drawers!  There is one thing you must know that we did not know upon arrival.  There are 13 steps up to front door of apt.  Then, after entering,  there are 13 more steps up to living room .  Then there are 13 more steps to bedroom/bathroom.  Then there are 16 steps to roof deck.  This is just a warning to older people who may not want to drag a suitcase up all those stairs.  The apt was lovely and the bed was SO comfy!  The neighborhood was great. We took Uber a lot. It's about 1/2 a mile to Whole Foods.  Many good restaurants in the area and Cheers is just around the corner.  There's a drugstore and liquor store on the corners and a Starbucks and Peet's coffee nearby.  Deluca's market is really close, if you don't want to go to Whole Foods.  I love Beacon Hill!"
250345,50611269,2015-10-13,28091408,Terry,The apartment was just as described and the location is perfect.  No contact with the host at all.
250345,51107669,2015-10-18,25003235,Patty,This location was ideal.  Situated one street back from historic Charles Street it was perfect for our special weekend.  We did not meet the hosts as we had keyless entry codes upon arrivsl. The management company however was vert attentive to our needs.
The condo was outfitted with anything you may need to make your visit enjoyable.  Extra bonus was the beautiful roof deck.  We were able to have cocktails up there and view the Boston skyline on a cool October afternoon.   One  word of caution,"the untit is only accessible by a long narrow stairway and then there are 2 more narrow stairways to navigate to get around in the condo.  If you have any mobility issues it would be difficult.\"",,,,
250345,53174844,2015-11-06,29153272,Robert,"The listing description was perfectly accurate.   The apartment was extremely comfortable and well appointed.  The roof deck was a real bonus.  The location, ambience and local amenities were all excellent."

13924495,93971897,2016-08-14,83503499,Lindsey,Ellen was very nice and responded quickly!  We had a guest cancel and she refunded us which was greatly appreciated!  The unit was large enough to sleep the 7 of us comfortably!
13924495,99351574,2016-09-04,45022346,Danielle,This house comfortably fit a big party of 8 people and was easy and accessible in Boston. No more than a 10-15 minute lyft from Cambridge area and some cute bars around.
Ellen was attentive and responded quickly to all requests or questions. I would definitely recommend staying here as she really made the experience easy and comfortable.,,,,,
One thing to note is that there are two bathrooms but only one of them has a shower (the other one is bathtub only).,,,,,
"Thank you Ellen! \"",,,,,

2384581,17519768,2014-08-13,1512107,Christopher,"Molly is one of the sweetest person I've met in Boston. I arrived around 3am at her place and she was completely cool with it. Despite my 24hr journey from SIngapore-SFO-Boston, I felt relaxed and comfortable the minute I met Molly and stepped in her house. The house is huge, beautifully renovated, and certainly designed with good taste. The loft has enough privacy and the bed is very comfy. The bathroom is gorgeous and the kitchen has everything you need. The neighborhood is also wonderful, a lot of parks, old trees and beautiful houses. The best perks of renting the place is of course meeting Molly. She's simply one of a kind and I hope to continue staying in touch with her."
2384581,17607053,2014-08-14,16632693,Sierra,"Molly was an amazing host. The place was very clean, comfortable and even inspiring as she did all the beautiful renovations herself. It was at least as   lovely as the airbnb images.  The location is very quiet, and accessible to great eating.  I learned a lot from Molly about Boston, Jamaica Plain (where to take storytelling and yoga classes) and un-intimidating triathlons. All in such a funny way that I was in tears laughing most of the time.  I'll have to take that story telling class!"
2384581,18292404,2014-08-24,1331140,Michael,"Molly was away and still rented her beautiful place to me.  A downstairs neighbor let me in and everything was as shown in the description.  Molly came home later that night and was incredibly welcoming, friendly, and warm.  She even offered to drive me to the T station the next morning!"
2384581,19353714,2014-09-10,21111341,Holly,"Molly was a sweet and welcoming host. She offered us snacks as soon as we arrived, followed by a brief tour of the apartment. Her home was as gorgeous and awe-inspiring as in the pictures.  The neighborhood was quiet-- just the right distance away from all the major buzz of the city while still being completely accessible."
2384581,19496111,2014-09-13,20941222,Vincent,Molly est une excellente hôte. Son logement de bon goût est bien situé par rapport aux transports en commun dans un beau petit quartier calme.
2384581,19863146,2014-09-19,10653168,Alexander,From the moment I walked in the door I had a good feeling about Molly and her beautiful apartment! She was so welcoming and made me feel right at home. My visit was brief and i definitely wish that I had more time to spend there! Great value and location in the heart of JP
2384581,19968757,2014-09-21,15284924,Kathy,We loved staying at Molly's place. She was very helpful and the space was awesome and we loved the neighborhood too. Would like to stay there when she is around. She seems like a very nice person. I highly recommend the place.

2384581,20728993,2014-10-04,12475928,Cheryl,"Although our stay was incredibly short the welcome from Molly was grand!  She wasn't there but made me feel welcome via text. Generally the space is open, airy and sun-filled.  The furnishings were a shabby chic: strange considering the space is so new and contemporary.  I have to say it wasn't very clean which, judging from other reviews I'd say this must have been an unfortunate exception to the norm.  The bed was lumpy."
2384581,22286550,2014-11-02,5137149,Grace,"Molly's place is gorgeous, a work of art how it's been put together. Great fun going up and down to the loft, and also hanging in the hammock. Some of the best-done tile work I've seen in the bathroom. A lovely quiet night with easy parking. Molly was quickly responsive and we sorted out the details fast. Her place was lovely and clean."
2384581,22555292,2014-11-09,22909747,Silvia,"Our stay at Molly's place was perfect! Molly is a super host: she was very welcoming and caring, providing us with maps, tips and infos on Boston and Jamaica Plains, and even driving us into the city! The house is extremely nice and cozy, clean and in a safe, residential neighborhood! I would definitely recommend Molly and her loft!"
2384581,27482160,2015-03-05,8932231,Margaret,"As you walk up the stairs to Molly's place the first thing you notice is the lovely smell, it's almost like fresh baked bread with different spices. I loved it. This is a great spot close enough to Boston yet in a wonderful small town. I would definitely recommend it to anyone"
2384581,30133297,2015-04-18,11561170,Lauren,Wonderful home and host! Highly recommend and will certainly look up next time I'm looking for a place to stay in Boston!
2384581,53235727,2015-11-06,3740061,Laura,"Molly is a lovely host, and was able to accommodate my last minute request. Everything was immaculate and Jamaica Plain is a wonderful area with the beautiful walk around the lake and great variety of restaurants. The apartment has a beautiful and open feel, and the ladder going up to the loft is very easy to navigate."
6378076,35006262,2015-06-14,7113403,Katie,"My friend and I stayed at Cory's place for 4 days this June and it was great! Cory's place was clean and comfortable. He met us with the keys and was very friendly. Everything we needed was all set up in the apartment and he gave us good directions on what to do in the apartment when we left. His place is in a fabulous neighborhood in Charlestown. It was about a 5 minute walk to the Bunker Hill monument and about a 10 minute walk to the cute downtown area of Charlestown which had historic taverns and secret gardens in the winding back alleys of the beautiful colonial homes. The roof deck was also a major plus! It really was gorgeous and we had coffee every morning on the roof and drink every evening, enjoying the view of the water and the bridge to Chelsea. There was a Whole Foods, CVS, liquor store and everything we needed close by and within walking distance. We had a great experience and Cory was a great host and very responsive to any questions we had. If I ever travel to Boston again I would definitely stay here again!"
6378076,37188681,2015-07-05,21678261,Sherilyn,"Cory ' s place was comfy,  clean and convenient.  It was a great spot for our home base in Boston. Parking was available right in front,  and rooftop deck a pretty spot to sit and relax. We both drove into Boston and used Uber.  Uber best choice;  parking expensive and traffic heavy. Cory was very helpful and responded to all our questions very quickly.  It was a great experience."
6378076,38152078,2015-07-13,9195901,Brooklyn,"Cory's place was great. Although I never met him in person, he was very responsive over email to all my questions. He also let me check in and out at the times that I wanted. I would definitely stay here again. The bed and couch are super comfy!"
6378076,38853494,2015-07-19,12507857,Olaf,"Cory's home was our home for three nights in beautiful Boston! Cory's a perfect host, communication as great and clear. And his home is clean, spacious enough and perfectly located. Why perfect? Parking in front of house (more or less), silent neighborhood and walking distance to everything you need (grocery, CVS, liquor, bunker hill, restautrants and even downtown Boston). Since we were with a small child (1y) we can' t travel easily by cab/uber, so we decided to walk to Boston ... and it's really just a 20-30 minutes walk ... we felt very very comfortable with it. Cory's home has everything you need - even a great deck with a cool view. If I will return to Boston someday, Cory's home would be my first choice :-)"
6378076,41778304,2015-08-09,1724315,Fie,"Cory was a very nice host, who came to help us as the door was broken and we needed a little help to open it. The place was clean and ready for us. The apartment is very dark, so it should mainly be rented by someone who wish to spend most of the time in the city and just use the apartment for sleeping."
"I must say though that the apartment was not located close to downtown Boston as advertised - we thought it was located too far from the city - also because it was pretty far from the subway as well. \"",,,,,
6378076,42411650,2015-08-13,4017291,Rachael,"Cory's place was perfect for our 3 day stay in Boston. The apartment was very clean and tidy, with everything we needed to have a comfortable stay provided for us. Cory was very flexible with our checking in and out times, and the lock box was a great help when we arrived late on our first night. Cory was very communicative and provided all the information we needed (like where to park the car) and responded quickly to all our questions. Thanks Cory!"
6378076,42990585,2015-08-16,6859997,Zach,Great experience! Perfect walking distance to bunker hill and really enjoyed having the deck to entertain after full days of walking.  Cory was very responsive when I emailed questions and would highly recommend his apartment.

We were out or away quite a bit and didn't have a chance to take advantage of the easy access to the running track (community center) just across the street or the rooftop deck and grill. Maybe next time!"

It was a great location (15 mins from the Back Bay Area where we were most) and the whole place was cozy and stacked with all the necessities (comfortable couch/bed, wifi, roku with Netflix, etc.) it was everything the listing described! Thank you so much for a great weekend Cory! I would definitely stay here again."
6378076,53498188,2015-11-09,19534019,Lisa,"This was a great place and so convenient to Boston.  I walked to my meeting at the Intercontinental Hotel and was surprised at how easy the walk was as I was thinking it would be a bigger deal to get under 93 and over the water, but it was easy sidewalks all the way."
The rooftop is awesome! The TV is large; the couch and bed were comfy; shower is strong.,,,,,
"The only limitation I would point out is that the entry stair may be a bit challenging if you are older and struggle with stairs; and the stairs to the rooftop doubly challenging!\"",,,,,
6378076,66040337,2016-03-19,55193863,Patrice,"The directions for access to the condo were clear and easy to follow.  The description was accurate, and the location was perfect for our visit as our daughter lives just down the street. We also enjoyed the track across the street for working out.  Possible improvements would be blinds or curtains on the bathroom window, a better pillow for the couch, and additional clean sheets for the sofa."

Overnight parking was the only issue. Brookline only allows residents with a permit to park on the street overnight.  We parked at a gas station for $25 a day,"which seems to be the going rate in this area.\"",,,,

The space had so much character and charm and was neat and clean as well. Located in the Brookline area, it was super convenient to the T green line and the neighborhood itself was SO awesome. So many shops/restaurants/bars/grocery stores/parks/running trails, etc. We would absolutely stay here again. Thank you Mosha for all your generous hospitality!"
2538536,14782721,2014-06-26,3508344,María Alejandra,My parents came to Boston for two weeks for my graduation and loved the place! Moshe was really kind and made sure they had everything we needed. Kept in touch with us and answered every question we had. The place was really comfortable and well kept and the location couldn't be beat. Steps away from the T and lots of stores. Will definitely have them or anybody else stay there again. 100% recommended!
2538536,14996145,2014-06-30,15152463,Brittney,Moshe's place was beautiful and in a great spot! My friend and I had no problems getting around Boston since the train stop was across the street from his place. Moshe's was very nice and even checked in to make sure we were enjoying our stay. He recommended some places to eat down the road and they had great food! I would recommend staying here to anyone who wants to see Boston!

I stayed for about a week with my girlfriend and it was a great place to visit Boston from, really spacious for what your paying for it."
Moshe was also a great guy: While we were late arriving from the airport,"he didnt seem to mind. He also provided tips about what to do and see in the neighbourhood. We felt really welcome here.\"",,,,
2538536,17038387,2014-08-06,5890502,Lana,"Moshe is the best host - very friendly, generous, helpful. We were fortunate to meet him in person, he met us at the apartment even though we arrived late in the evening, he showed us around and gave us a lot of useful ideas and tips about Boston. The apartment is very charming, clean and comfortable, exactly as it is shown in the pictures. I should also mention the beautiful neighborhood and nice neighbors (if you happen to meet them). The T-train line is almost across the road from the house, so you can get around town with no problem. At a short walk distance from the house there are cafes and restaurants and a large supermarket. If you are fond of running, you can enjoy a good run around the neighborhood alined with trees and beautiful houses. There is also a public swimming pool you can use. We had such an amazing time in Boston and we owe much of that pleasure to Moshe and his friendliness and good heart. If you travel to Boston, staying at Moshe's house will be a wonderful choice to make."

Moshe was an amazing and accommodating host who was always available whenever we had a question. His place was right across the T-stop which was super convenient for my parents who felt they could easily navigate Boston. It is also very close to Cleveland circle (which has a few restaurants and convenient stores and a CVS) so that was convenient as well. The apartment is very sunny, welcoming and warm. All in all we had a wonderful experience at Moshe's apartment and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Boston."

He was always available and gave great recommendations for restaurants and markets in the area. The apartment is in a great location. You can reach anywhere in the Boston area by way of the metro lines located within a block of the front door. Also, there are several Zipcar locations within walking distance. As advertised the apartment is sunny and inviting. One of the best surprises when we arrived was the deep soaker jacuzzi bathtub and rain shower head with unlimited hot water. My wife and I love to cook so the gas stove was ideal. We would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting the Boston area."

She even took the time to show me around the city personally. I'm going to be moving to Boston next month and it's great to know that I already have a friend when I get there. She's very passionate about her city and she wants to make sure her guests see the same thing. I couldn't have asked for a better experience!

The neighborhood offered numerous options for dinner and she picked an interesting place for the dinner we shared where I had one of the best meals of my trip.

My time in Julie's apartment was perfect and much more. South end is very beautiful and the location of the apartment is really in the heart of South end. I found everything I needed at less than 5 min of the apartment. The space was very neat, calm and the airbed is very comfortable (better than lots of bed). I felt at home the entire time I was there. Icing on the cake, Julie was the best host i have ever met. Julie is a generous and helpful host that not only helped me navigate to and from her apartment, but was warm and welcoming and who I enjoyed chatting with. She brings a wonderful perspective on life in Boston. In addition, if you want to go out, Julie will show you the best places in South end. If you want to have some rest Julie will let you alone in the living room. I really enjoyed my stay at Julie’s place and I absolutely recommend it. I took this airbnb to have a bed and now I have an awesome new friend. Thank you Julie !"

Also Julie was pending of my trip progress through text messages and about the time I wanted to check-in, so that she will be available to provide me with the keys and brief me about how the stuff in the house functioned. I felt really welcomed and her easygoing personality really made feel at home. The place description was very accurate and the neighborhood was absolutely great!"
5976821,33468320,2015-05-28,31741739,Arina,Julie was an super nice & amazing host! :)
She always made sure we had everything we needed,but also gave us enough space to just relax (with her two cuddly cats).,,,,
The area where her place is,was just perfect for us to go out and explore the city or just grab something to eat very close by ;) Plus she also gave us a super neat sheet of all the information we needed to get around and breakfast on her balcony was just the best ;),,,,
Would definitely recommend this! :),,,,,

Her cats are two very talkative creatures and her robotic vacuum is quite fun to watch. The bed was so comfy and the flat is incredible.

I would definitely recommend this staying here :)"
5976821,36148281,2015-06-25,14385543,Mark,"This is a must-do -- Julie and her condo are absolutely amazing.  I wish there was a way I could give this listing more than five stars. Her place is in a spectacular location, and is an easy walk to a variety of great restaurants, bars, and scenic locales.  The room itself is fantastic – it’s cozy and clean, and her two cats are adorable.  But most importantly, Julie herself is a wonderful hostess, and it’s her warmth and passion that really make this place so special. Throughout my stay, I got to know Julie quite well, through both hanging out at local hotspots (which she recommended!) as well as relaxing at the apartment.  This was definitely not an experience I could have gotten elsewhere, and totally made the trip for me.  It was great to experience Boston from an insider’s perspective, especially one so fantastic as Julie!"
5976821,37909060,2015-07-11,37258892,Seb,Julie was extremely welcoming and accommodating even before I had arrived by communicating with me to ensure she is available to greet me upon arrival and was even so kind as to ask if i needed any food or drink upon my arrival before I had even met her!
Once settled she made me feel extremely comfortable and at home in my temporary accommodation. She made me aware of her schedule and always offered tips and recommendations for things to do!,,,,,

Staying in Julie's apartment was the highlight of my trip in Boston! I had never expected that I would make such great friend! I wish I could stay longer and have more fun!,,,,,
Julie is such a sweet,considerable and energetic host.

We turned out to be good friends and we both feel happy to know each other.,
Julie responds quickly and tries her best to help. We kept in touch very well before checking in and she gave me lots of suggestions and useful infos.,,,,,
The apartment was so artsy,peaceful and cozy. It was absolutely clean and tidy,and also functional. The washer,dry,iMac and printer brought me so much convenience!!

It was super easy to find places to eat (the pizzeria across the street was awesome) and to navigate around the city by walking.  If you are looking for a real Boston experience,"stay at Julie's place.\"",,,,

I have left this city feeling that I love it more than any other, I need to move there. Julie is an accomodating host, her enthusiasm for Boston makes YOU excited about Boston! I have met a friend that I wish to last a lifetime. If you are looking for a fun, exciting place to stay, a place where you will get the local feel of Boston, then you should stay at Julie's!

5976821,50669806,2015-10-13,5680369,Erin,"Julie was an incredible host and we are extremely pleased that of the many options of places to stay in Boston, we chose her adorable apartment. Her cats are super sweet and friendly - especially Ben! The location is perfect. Having never visited Boston and knowing very little about the city, I gathered, during my short visit, that the South End is a hip and vibrant area with so much to offer! It ended up being our favorite part of the city. We were able to either walk, or take a quick Uber everywhere we wanted and/or needed to go. Her place is cute, clean, and accessible to everything Boston has to offer. Unfortunately, we did not get to spend much time with Julie, as we were only in the city a few days and were out and about most of the time. But she kept in contact with us throughout our time there, updating us and making sure we had everything we needed. In short, stay with Julie! Great value and an organic experience of Boston's locals and culture."

We were pretty busy the entire time so we didn't spend a ton of time with Julie, but she definitely knows the city really well and had lots of great suggestions for us!"

The space is perfect,the place was very well kept and super nice and the location was within walking distance of everything youd wanna do in Boston.  On top of that Julie was dang amazing in always looking out for me if I ever needed anything specific or just needing ideas of things to do.  I was gone a lot of the time (for PAX that weekend) but had great conversations a couple of the mornings.  Yeah so, I dont think I can think of a negative thing the whole time.  Would definitely do this again and avoid stupid $400/day non-personable hotels."

Julie has been super caring and helpful giving full of tips and helping me with some issue I had by renting a bike.

We knew Southend was the place to be to get the feel of Boston. Were we ever right. This is the best located Airbnb in the area. You are walking distance to everything, bike share program is a 2 minute walk to rent, and will be definitely coming back to this Airbnb when we come back!"
In terms of the home itself,it was way better than the pictures itself. The air mattress was super comfy like no other,the washroom had a great waterfall shower head,and the part that made it the best was the patio. This patio was something from a movie,and words can't describe it but every morning we ate breakfast and just enjoyed the atmosphere.,

5976821,92878634,2016-08-10,86296877,Bill,Julie was a great host. She communicated from the very beginning and was available whenever I asked for any help. She was nearly absent in the home as we never actually met Julie. This allowed for excellent privacy. The location was ideal. Only problem for us was dealing with cats and being mildly allergic. Place was clean and she had everything set for us to shower and use her place.
5976821,93392020,2016-08-12,84124518,Christopher,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I am pleased to say that it was a great one. The value for money for a stay in Julie’s place is incredible, because the property is beautiful and the South End is walking distance to almost everything you could hope to do as a tourist. However, the thing that makes a stay here a great one is the remarkable efforts that the host will go to so that you have a memorable stay. Although we only had 30 minutes of face time over a three-day stay, it always felt as though Julie was close by. She is extremely responsive to messages, and her personality is engaging. I can highly recommend a stay at Julie’s place."

She has such a warm personality and makes it hard not to like her. Her place is beautiful and look exactly like the photos! She has a gorgeous front porch that we could climb out and enjoy the breeze in the morning. On our first day of arrival, Julie sat down with us and recommended places we could explore. She would constantly check with us if we needed help, but at the same time, giving us our room of privacy. We absolutely love everything about her and her cosy place, her cats (Ben and Jack) as well! It was our first Airbnb experience and Julie definitely created a great memory for us. Highly recommended!"

He was very available to me by phone prior to our arrival to make sure we were taken care of and keys were arranged. He was also in communication by text and phone once we arrived, making sure everything was to our liking. I was a very independent guest (and prefer it that way), but Prasun seemed to be more than willing to attend to our needs."
The apartment was very clean and wonderfully spacious and airy. Additionally,it is very centrally located and a short ($5-$10) cab ride from any attraction. You can even walk to Copley Plaza in about 15 min. Prasun was sure to be clear that the apartment is not yet furnished prior to confirming my booking. There are,however,futon-style mattresses on the floor,as pictured. Anything else you may need (i.e. towels,other linens

6348631,33717791,2015-05-31,17455382,Michel,The apartment is well located in an amazing neighborhood. It is missing a bit furniture to make it comfortable like home but it's what we expected after we read the description before booking. The owner is helpful and easy to contact.
6348631,34167357,2015-06-05,34285300,Linda,"Prasun was a great host and I really appreciated how responsive he was. The apartment was immaculate when we got there, and even though there are no real beds, the temperpedic mattress was very comfortable. The kitchen and bathroom are also very nicely done. There are some great restaurants around the corner, too!"
6348631,34343947,2015-06-07,26112931,Carmine,"Great communication. Easy to get a hold of via phone and quick to return airbnb emails.  Apartment is right next to an Irish pub, so it was a little loud on the weekend, otherwise the apt was clean. Plenty of towels. Soap and shampoo was provided. Great doughnut place down the street. Blackbird doughnuts."
6348631,34727119,2015-06-11,33904841,Andras,"Nice apartment as described (empty, but for 2 queen mattresses, one in each bedroom). Nice kitchen and bathroom. We used it only for sleeping in at night while at a conference, so can't comment on neighborhood."
6348631,35142554,2015-06-15,34622660,Thomas,Had a great stay. Good location and a beautiful flat. Key arrangements were very easy as we're all communications.

Lovely, safe neighborhood not far from the action  of Boston but quiet at night and in walking distance from nice restaurants, shops and even the Sunday farmers market. Candice left cooking items for us and the house was perfectly appointed for our trip with two adults and a baby. Highly recommend!"
7275018,43654528,2015-08-21,10414369,Larisa,"We had a great time at Candice house, the house is spacious and clean, fully equipped for the guests need, we had no problems or complaints whatsoever. Larisa and Jerry."
7275018,44173717,2015-08-24,3301448,Milt,Candice's house was perfect for us. Getting there by (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps took us through scenic neighborhoods and the house itself is in a very quiet location. Everything we needed was available and clearly described and Candice was a great communicator.
1887581,8823590,2013-11-19,9304488,Zac And Isabel,Polina's apartment is great! It's tastefully decorated and is very convenient to the convention center and downtown locations. We were able to make breakfast in the morning and walk to local eateries for dinner. - Zac and Isabel
1887581,9035977,2013-12-02,9952194,Laurene,"We had a really great time at Paulina's apartment. She was there when we arrive, made us a tour and gave us the keys. It was really clean and the place is awesome."
"It's the perfect plan to visit Boston with friends \"",,,,,
1887581,9652046,2014-01-04,3178227,Kenneth,Polina's apartment was very nice and the location was very convenient too. We were not able to meet her personally but everything was set up for us to have a nice stay in Boston. I can positively recommend this listing.
1887581,9778766,2014-01-09,8474726,Dillon,"We had a great time staying in Polina's apartment. The location is very convenient to the subway, and South Station is about 15 minutes away by foot. Polina was a perfect host: she responded extremely quickly to all queries, and her local information was very helpful. We tried out all the bars and restaurants that she recommended and enjoyed them a lot. I'd be happy to stay again."
1887581,9937059,2014-01-20,5899847,Ogo,"Polina was great from start to finish. From the onset, she laid out clear instructions of how to access her place and kindly informed us of the local places to visit."
In terms of the place,it was very nice and ideally located (10 min taxi ride to downtown Boston).,,,,
We had a slight issue with a door and Polina was on hand,early morning,to support us over the phone.,,,
"I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Boston.\"",,,,,
1887581,10686076,2014-03-03,11489129,Flavia,"I went to Boston with other 4 friends in February, and we stayed in Polina's apartment. Polina is really kind and helpful, the apartment was clean, and the instruction to go inside were perfect!"
Subway is at 4 minutes walking,and it is 2 stops to Downtown.,,,,
There's also a good grocery store near the apartment,where you can buy something to cook at home.,,,,
There's also a pub where you can find a good Italian pizza (I'm Italian,so believe me!). :),,,,
The apartment is quite and no noises disturbed us,"if you want you can turn the heater on to be warm. \"",,,,
1887581,10838691,2014-03-10,4943877,Gavin,"Polina's place was perfect for our weekend in Boston.  Bright, clean and well appointed, easy free on-street parking, 5 min walk to great restaurants and shops, and 10 minute cab to everything else in downtown Boston.  I particularly appreciate Polina working with me and shifting the dates of my weekend one day when personal issues forced a date change.  Thanks for everything."
1887581,11044435,2014-03-18,8063308,Florian Charlie,We enjoyed our stay in Boston very much. Polina has a fully equipped apartment and everything was very well organized.
1887581,11170748,2014-03-24,10333372,Brad,"Stayed at Polina's place during the Extreme Beer Fest in March! It was great. The grocery store at the corner was perfect and it was a short walk to the convention center and Harpoon Brewery! Now,  if I can only keep it a secret so it's available next year."
1887581,11733751,2014-04-14,9822054,Kora,Polina made everything so easy and responded to our messages within minutes! She made sure we had everything we needed to know about her beautiful loft and even provided recommendations to some of her favorite places to visit in Boston. We will definitely try to book her for next year!
1887581,12143790,2014-04-24,9239483,Kim,"Polina was a wonderful host who gave great local recommendations. The apartment was warm, tidy and very comfortable even when we had six adults. Location is brilliant and very close to the T. Polina stayed in touch the whole time which was good for us during our stay as we had a small issue at the house that was completely out of her control. Polina had the issue fixed within hours and kept us in the loop the whole time- it was not an inconvenience to us at all - brilliant! Beds comfy and kitchen great. Excellent bars and restaurants nearby. I gave the whole experience five stars and would highly recommend staying at Polina's when you are in Boston. We will be back!"
1887581,12190848,2014-04-25,5666111,Lisa,"Polina is a really nice host, very easy to communicate with and gave us lots of great tips to enjoy the neighborhood.   The apartment is very clean and comfortable."
1887581,12650430,2014-05-07,10827774,May,"Convenient location, cute place, clean and reasonable price. Cable would be a plus. Upstairs neighbors are loud at night. Some closet space for hanging clothes would be nice. On the other hand, Polina was responsive and a good host."
1887581,13276134,2014-05-24,834213,Theresa,"We stayed one night at Polina's place for our daughter's graduation from Mass College of Art and Design.  Polina was very good with the preliminaries.  She sent a fairly detailed pdf of all the logistics, minus one important thing- parking(more on that in a sec.).  We were in touch by text, as we had a glitch and could not check in until 10 PM."
The place was cute,not fancy but quite functional.  Great little neighborhood and proximity to the waterfront.  The bathroom was not cleaned very well- back of toilet and sink were quite dirty.  The 2 beds are full beds and not on the large side.  We had 5 in our party and with someone sleeping on the couch and my two daughters on the queen airbed,we fit OK.,,,
The one thing I wish Polina had made clear is that there is NO overnight parking on the street where the apartment is.  A local parking permit is needed to park there overnight and one is not provided.  We got a $40 parking ticket. After Polina told us there is parking a few blocks over,but it was late when we arrived and we had no idea. I asked her if she would be willing to take the $40 off our rate and she declined.  Bummer.  I thought that was not being unreasonable.,,,,
For what we used it for,"it was fine.  Price is reasonable.  Not sure if I was coming to Boston for a vacation if I would stay here or not. \"",,,,
1887581,13499301,2014-05-29,9430511,Marisa,We had a great time in Boston! Staying at Polina's was very convenient! We spent most of our time at the Convention Center for a conference (on a few minute walk from her place) and when we had time t venture out we walked a few blocks to the T station. There's also a great little diner and meat pie place just down the street from her place.
I stayed here with 5 others,so we had 2 on each of the beds and 2 on the air mattress and didn't feel cramped. The kitchen was a good size too! The bathroom was a little small when sharing with 6 girls- knowing that we'd all be sharing the one bathroom I brought an extra handle held mirror which worked out great.,,,,
"Definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Boston! :)\"",,,,,
1887581,13562654,2014-05-31,4023593,Michelle,"Great stay, close to the T, and Polina was very responsive."

"Bien situé sur la ligne de métro pour les visites\"",,,,,
1887581,14342807,2014-06-17,3132406,Chris,Coordinating and communication with Polina was excellent. The neighborhood was accurately described in the apartment's summary. Highly recommended!
1887581,15386419,2014-07-08,11179867,Derek,"We had a great time in Boston.  Apt is close to good food local market, and the T.  The host is nice and I had no complaints.  I would recommend this to anyone."

We didn’t meet Paulina, but we received very detailed instructions by email some days before our arrival, so we had no problem as we were also in contact by phone. The flat is well located in a quiet street close enough to the subway and very close to a supermarket and to some places for a quick dinner or breakfast. Only a remark:  under the beds floors were rather dusty."
1887581,17670258,2014-08-16,13068729,Christine,"logement bien situé, quartier calme et assez proche du métro"
le descriptif présente 3 lits mais il y a seulement 2 lits et un canapé non convertible. Un troisième matelas est proposé en supplément de 25$ par nuit. Les serviettes de toilettes étaient trop peu nombreuses (une seule par personne) et de dimension ridicule (1 seule de bain pour 4 !). L'équipement de la cuisine ne comprend ni grille pain,ni cafetière,"ni bouilloire. Bref trop cher pour la prestation proposée. très peu de contact mais interventions efficaces et réactive nous n'avons jamais rencontré Polina. Les modalités pour la garer la voiture méritent d'être améliorées.\"",,,
1887581,18784063,2014-09-01,14065026,Sophie,"We had a very good stay in Boston and we appreciated to go back to Polina's appartment each evening. It is a lovely place just as on the photos. And in a quiet area of Boston! With the line 9 bus, you reach dowtown very quickly. And it is close to foodies market and not far from redline metro!"
And Polina was very responsive to our queries,"very quick and useful answers!\"",,,,
1887581,19064834,2014-09-06,8232822,Cady,Lovely place. Had no problems. Polina was able to answer all questions in a timely manner via e-mail. Quiet neighborhood and conveniently located.
1887581,19813559,2014-09-19,9489972,Gabriel,Polina was very friendly and responsive. Everything was just as described. Location was great for our conference at the BCEC. Great experience.
1887581,20272628,2014-09-27,10979524,Bianca,Lacking in day to day items. Not many cooking utensils. No information on the area about shops & so forth. A little out of the way.
"Beds were uncomfortable \"",,,,,
1887581,21120689,2014-10-12,7134233,Holly,Great apartment and location.  Only issues were that the neighbors were very loud and no extra toilet paper.
1887581,21331831,2014-10-15,13071858,Cathy,Poling was very good at responding to all enquiries quickly and was very helpful.
Her apartment was conveniently located and had good access to downtown Boston. The listing was as described but has minimal kitchen equipment so self-catering would be a little difficult. There was no kettle or mugs for drinking hot beverages. The neighbourhood had slightly limited opportunities for eating out but is obviously beginning to be up and coming.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1887581,21699568,2014-10-22,2984833,Eric,"We stayed at Polina's apartment for 5 nights while at a conference at BCEC. The apartment was just as described, well-appointed, and close to transit and convention center. Polina was responsive and everything went smoothly getting in and out of the apartment. She also pointed us towards some rare non-permit parking areas for our rental car a few blocks from the apartment."
1887581,22334447,2014-11-03,21658812,Eli,The host was extremely helpful.  The place was exactly as described even the covers on the bed where accurate.  I wish I had more time in Boston.  This would be my first choice. Thank you.
1887581,22710249,2014-11-12,431883,Cruce,"Polina is a communicative and helpful host who provides a lovely  apartment in Boston in a quiet neighborhood not too far from the waterfront.  I will provide a few pointers for future visitors that may be helpful. The property is located just over 1 mile from the waterfront down Avenue D. It is not nearly as close as the radius suggest when you are evaluating location. We used Uber successfully to shuttle back and forth between the event at the seaport hotel on the waterfront and the apartment.  There is no closet in the main bedroom, as it is locked off. Only one towel per person is provided, and you will need to request additional towels or hand towels if needed. There is no access provided to a washing machine. There is one bathroom that will be shared between the guests. It provides hot water and a comfortable shower. The wifi is very good and dependable."
1887581,22976365,2014-11-19,829356,Michelle,"Polina gave me very accurate instructions and check in was simple. The location is so convenient for the convention center, but also within walking distance of everything we needed.  The apartment was clean and comfortable and I would stay there again for future Boston trips."
1887581,28979362,2015-04-02,23347619,Julia,"Nice place, about 15 minute walk to the convention center and 25 minutes to the waterfront. Grocery and liquor store right around the corner. We enjoyed our stay and Polina was helpful and responsive. Apartment has two double beds and couch."
1887581,31180606,2015-05-03,13245793,Eric,Listing was accurate. We had a great experience.
1887581,31664109,2015-05-08,31792590,Michael,The apartment was clean and just as seen on the ad. The location was superb and close to everything :)

1887581,36253447,2015-06-26,35711803,Colleen,Polina was gracious and flexible working with us to setup the accommodation on very short notice. The apartment was as pictured and located very near public transit. Street parking was a bit of a challenge but she gave us suggestions on where to look for parking and we were able to make it work. I would recommend this apartment to other guests!

Polina nous avait envoyé en avance toutes les informations nécessaires à notre installation, accueil, wifi, commodités du quartier..."
1887581,40579581,2015-08-01,24493659,Tera,The apartment was as it was shown and it was convenient area - close to the T and walking distance to lots of things. We walked to the T-Party ships on the first day.
However,It was not very cleanly. When we arrived we noticed that the dishwasher was half full of dirty dishes and most of the dishes in the cupboard were obviously dirty as well (as in wine and orange soda still in the bottom of glasses). Poli did offer to come run the dishwasher for us,which we passed on because we did load all the dishes into the washer and run it. She said that the renters were responsible for dishes,which is fair,but I would have expected that if they didn't take care of it the cleaning staff would have. The beds were poorly made and we had concerns they hadn't been laundered. Poli assured us they had. The real kicker on the cleanliness for me was the shower curtain that was half covered in mold - that was gross and if you don't want to wash it at least buy a new one. The kitchen lacked some fairly essential items,like a coffee maker and a dish towel (no hand towel in the bathroom either)
One last odd thing - she had something from IKEA delivered while we were there so we had to receive it (which we were unaware of). The address listed on the delivery was correct,but she said it was delivered to the wrong place. We let her know it was there and I told her we were out - so I guess she just came in to get it while we were gone because it was missing when we got back. I found it odd that she didn't ask if it was okay to come in while we were gone. I wouldn't have had a problem with it,"but it would have been nice to be asked since all of our stuff was there.\"",,,
1887581,40908490,2015-08-03,29317885,Suzanne,Polinas appartment is very nice and fully equipped. Boston downtown can be reached easily.
1887581,45607893,2015-09-04,20741219,Greg,The place was clean and in reasonable condition. Close to a good small grocery. A 15 minute walk to a bunch of restaurants. A fine spot for 2-3 people. Parking is tough.
1887581,46464827,2015-09-11,7183096,Evan,"Everything leading up to the stay was great. Communication was easy and prompt. I was a little bummed that with a couple months notice we hoped to modify our stay by 1 less day and the host would not accommodate our request. (But, that was okay). We knew from the reviews that some other guests had listed that housekeeping was not up to their expectations and I would agree with that. The place is located in a great area. It is super close to the BECE. There are places to eat and shop not too far away. What we were not happy with is that the beds all had hairs in them (multiple lengths, colors, etc) and while the host said the sheets were freshly laundered, this was still a major turn off. She did bring other sheets but working through that request was a hassle. We switched the sheets out ourselves and all of the beds had stains on them. The refrigerator was not clean either and the shower curtain was moldy. The photos are accurate. The things you can't see in the photos - housekeeping - were disappointing."
1887581,48693787,2015-09-28,18423843,Donnie,"We were in town for a convention and this place was a 10-12 minute walk or a min rate ($10) Uber to the convention center. Nice neighborhood with easy (5 minute) walk to pubs, convenience stores, restaurants and pharmacies. The apartment was well maintained and comfortable, but we were really only there to sleep, not much during the day."
1887581,49188365,2015-10-01,1359558,Sanjay,Poli was very responsive on text so  I was not in the dark.  She also had good instructions on what to do.
1887581,49401888,2015-10-03,7381289,Yuval,"It was a rather short stay, towards weekend, communications with Poli was very smooth and all the process (arrive, get keys etc) was fluent. We arrived late night but as the key was ready in locker - it was no problem at all."
Very nice apartment,well maintained,central location.,,,
"All in all - very positive. Thanks.\"",,,,,
1887581,49601880,2015-10-05,38078563,蔚歆,"Poli's apartment has a good location. In a quiet and beautiful neighborhood, very near to subway station. Convenient to get to downtown and Cambridge."
We arrived quite late that night and Poli was waiting for us at the apartment.,,,,,
The bathroom and kitchen were modern and clean. The air condition worked well. The beds were warm and cozy. We all had good sleeps. And there's a balcony we could bask on in sunshine. I feel so lucky to find Poli's apartment! The pity was that we only stayed in Boston just for two nights.,,,,,
Btw,"the take-away food in the restaurant which Poli recommended was so delicious!\"",,,,
1887581,50285373,2015-10-11,40429221,Alicia,Listing description is completely accurate and the neighborhood was wonderful! Beautiful apartment. Great suggestions from host. Great outdoor deck. Loved everything! Only difficult part was parking but that's to be expected in a city.

We did not met Poli.,,,,,
The apartment is in a first floor by escaletor. Confortable. But we did not had enough towels (3 towels for 4 people and not hands towels at all),there were not 4 beds (only 2 and a sofa) the same with the sheets,they were not ironed  and clean and only two sets of them. There were not  beakers or fees. The fridge was not clean enough . There were not soap at the bathroom and either not a keetle to heat water.,,,
"The wi fi signal was ok. The shower was great. We did not use the tv because there were not cable tv. \"",,,,,
1887581,54694938,2015-11-23,27931447,Yu,Poli was a great host. Had no problem at all and everything went smoothly. Thank you!
1887581,64853677,2016-03-08,58488208,Thomas,It was a great area and very quiet after a busy day from the Boston Seafood Show.
1887581,66572412,2016-03-23,62161566,Heidi,"Although I do believe our host attempted to make us have a comfortable stay, there were some pretty terrible parts that really affected our stay.  First of all, the thermostat was set to go down to 54 degrees automatically every evening and in the 60s during the day.  The program set (once I found it) had it triggered to go down multiple times during the day and evening.  No matter what we turned it up to, it automatically turned it back down.  Needless to say, we both got the flu.  Being there for work where we had to go to the conference center was terrible.  Not only were we sick, but the walk brought us through the area that was burnt out factory buildings.  Not the safest for two girls to walk through.  The neighborhood is up and coming and had some fun spots.  Food was easy to find and the actual street we were on was ok.  What was also a horrible part of the experience was the neighbors.  On Saturday night there was a huge party up and down the block due to a parade the next day.  The lack of insulation had the two sick, cold girls left with no sleep.  For the next night, the neighbors upstairs had a fight so bad that we almost called the police.  Terrible.  So no sleep that night.  Then the final night had street work with jack hammers happening all night.  I have a video of jack hammers going at 3:00 am, so very unhappy.  Overall, this was not a great experience and with the thermostat control, downright miserable.  I would recommend looking elsewhere if you are going here for work."
1887581,71288619,2016-04-24,8702653,Michael,"Excellent host, perfect place to stay during the convention.  Highly recommended."
1887581,78850141,2016-06-09,73226866,Eric,"Fantastic place to stay!  An easy 10 minute walk to the Boston Convention Center.  Neighborhood was young and hip, and you can see a lot of transformation going on.  Great bars, restaurants within a few minutes of walking, yet only a $10 UBER to downtown Boston."
If you want to get the home town feel of South Boston this is the place for you.  Clean,and comfortable apartment,and a much better bargain than the high priced hotels  in the area.  Will definitely keep this place on my list for when I visit Boston.,,,
Lastly Poli did a great job with communication.  Everything was as described,"and she made the process super simple.\"",,,,
1887581,80243511,2016-06-17,9217072,Amanda,Very close to amazing restaurants. She recommends checking ou lincoln and it was my favorite spot!

There's neat parks, bars, and restaurants all within walking distance. The apartment had all the amenities you need. There's also a balcony perfect for relaxation on a cool day. Very clean and gave me a sense of home. If we had questions regarding our stay Poli was quick and timely when it came to assisting with anything we needed. Highly recommend this place if you're looking to experience that authentic Boston lifestyle."

Wonderful host,with a great and comfortable apartment! The host is quick to respond with any questions,and very easy to deal with. The host also had very good recommendations regarding dining and parking options around the property.,,,
The apartment was very clean and well maintained. It is located in the Southend of Boston,"and only about a 15-20 drive to most of the major attractions in and around Boston.\"",,,,
1887581,89398458,2016-07-28,84362781,Barry,Poli was great to deal with and made the process easy.  We had arrived into town to find our original reservation cancelled.  We fortunately found Poli and she was very helpful.  The apartment was clean and as shown on the pictures.  Convenient via Uber or Train to the downtown area for business travelers.
1887581,92659723,2016-08-09,77734252,Harvest,It was so incredibly kind to have left a bottle of wine for us. We felt very welcome and so appreciative to stay somewhere so close to where we needed to be each day.
1887581,98244316,2016-08-30,75087207,Kate,Just as expected and a super easy move in to Poli's home! Will definitely book again in the future!
1374466,9344325,2013-12-23,7928685,Flávia,I loved my room! It was everything that was written: cozy and very clean. Michelle was also a perfect host! She cared about everybody in the house and was always asking if everything was ok and if we needed something. I totally enjoy my stay! I have very good memories of my time there and I recommend Michelle's place for everybody :)
1374466,11317702,2014-03-30,10041199,Terese,"\"Michelle is a gracious hostess, very much concerned with the comfort of her guests. She has much information about the area and is happy to share.  She will walk with you to the  \"\"T\"\"  or bus station to assure you won't get lost.  She even picked me up from the airport when I left for a weekend trip.  It is not unusual to find homemade muffins or granola bars on the kitchen table in the morning. If I return to Boston I will be checking to see if Michelle has openings!\""
1374466,11671700,2014-04-11,943174,Ryn,"Michelle truly is an airbnb SUPERHOST! Her kindness, warmth and intelligent conversation are outstanding. She really knows urban Boston and her neighborhood in depth. We felt so lucky to taste her yummy baked goods and wonderful potluck contributions! Finally, the fleece bedlinens were SO comfy!"
"Thank you for a memorable stay. \"",,,,,
1374466,11765751,2014-04-14,7038422,Kevin,Michelle met me at the nearest underground. She was very interesting on the way up to the room. The place itself was very clean and comfortable. Michelle also baked some things for breakfast which were excellent! It was a very pleasant stay and I would highly recommend this listing.
1374466,12809570,2014-05-12,10345272,Shao-Yu,This room with a king-sized bed is perfect for one person! The big sofa and the shelf also made the room more comfortable. Michelle changed a desk for me because I have to do some studying during my stay. She is definitely the one who take her guest's needs seriously and try her best to help!
The kitchen,restroom and the living room are so clean and lovely,especially the kitchen,which is equipped with almost everything for cooking. Sometimes there might be a plate of cakes or muffins on the table baked by Michelle,or you might be invited to a potluck with other roommates,eating
Michelle is no doubt a super host! She not only takes care of her guests,but give suggestions on your trip in Boston. She has told me many stories about the neighborhoods,the places to enjoy a meal and even some interesting spots around Boston,"such as Rockport and Salem. My 2-month life in Boston wouldn't have been so wonderful without staying here!\"",,
1374466,13007936,2014-05-17,14324264,Linnéa,"Michelle is a wonderful hostess. She met me at the nearest subway station when I arrived and told me interesting stories about the neighbourhood while we walked back to the house. The room was nice and the bed had the fluffiest comforter ever (loved it). It wasn't possible to lock the door to the room, but I felt totally safe leaving my things there when leaving the house."
"It's an old but charming house in a friendly neighbourhood. It has a good vibe and I enjoyed the company of the other guests. Michelle came down for a chitchat every day and brought us a lot of home-baked goodies - she even made gluten- and dairy-free muffins for me since I couldn't eat any of the \"\"normal\"\" treats (allergies). I really appreciate that!",,,,,
"This was my first airbnb experience and I couldn't have had a better one. I recommend this place!\"",,,,,
1374466,13080625,2014-05-19,13890861,Sarah,What a wonderful vacation in Boston! Michelle was the perfect host with personal touches like meeting us at the train station and baking us homemade goodies! We will definitely be back to stay with Michelle again.
1374466,14549956,2014-06-22,12464820,Angelita,"Michelle is a great host! She's so receptive to requests and the sweetest person ever. The room is very spacious and I loved the walk-in closet. The bed is also very comfortable. The neighborhood is usually very quiet and people are very nice. It's a good walk to the train station but it's nice and not that far of a ride from the Downtown area. Overall, Michelle is great and I'm going to miss her very much. She also makes awesome baked goodies!!!"
1374466,15114695,2014-07-02,8758303,Vincent,I had read comments that Michelle is an airbnb superhost...and she definitely is.
I had a great time staying at Michelle's. The room was great,with a lot of space,the bed was very comfy.The neighborhood is residential and very pleasant,conveniently located a few subway stations from downtown Boston. Coming from Canada,I lost my passport a couple of days before I was due to arrive in Boston. Michelle went out of her way to accomodate me. She also took me to the nearest pharmacy upon arrival eventhough it was late.,
She is also very knowledgable about the city.,,,,,
She also gave me great advice to go to the seaside 1 hour north of Boston.,,,,,
"I highly recommend staying at Michelle.\"",,,,,
1374466,15416343,2014-07-08,15928872,Bernadette,We had a good time at Michelle's. She really is a very warm person who makes you feel very welcome at her place. She picked us up at the subway station when we arrived and also made sure we found our way to the bus which took us out of town.
The bedroom was exactly as in the picture,very spacious and nice. All in all,we can highly recommend staying at her place,"although we unfortunately have to mention that the bathroom was not as clean as it could have been (which could also have been due to the other (male) guests who were there as well).\"",,
1374466,15558188,2014-07-11,17348714,Andrea,Michelle was lovely and so was her home! Friendly and very charismatic. Thank you for everything!!
1374466,15720778,2014-07-14,16701885,Celina,Michelle was very friendly and hospitable. It was nice to stay at her House.
1374466,21502684,2014-10-19,12840216,Timothy,"I stayed at Michelle's place for about 3 month, and I really liked it! Everything is exactly like in the description, and especially the well-equipped kitchen was a big plus (there is even a Spätzlereibe!)."
The neighborhood is pretty quiet. It's a completely residential area,so there are no supermarkets,cafés or restaurants in immediate vicinity of the house.,,,
Michelle herself is super nice and always trying to help where she can. She always took care of problems immediately (e.g. when the washing machine broke) and got things fixed right away. She also often made muffins or pumpkin pie,which were really delicious :),,,,
Bottom line,"I can only wholeheartedly recommend the apartment!\"",,,,
1374466,22702818,2014-11-12,21697321,Lee,Had an excellent experience with my first time using AIRBNB. Michelle was a great host (and makes excellent granola bars). The area in Roxbury we stayed at was an easy 10 minute walk to the T. I loved making the walk everyday. Absolutely perfect experience.
1374466,25922087,2015-01-30,16867272,Marina,"I had a great time at Michelle's! She was great, she baked muffins and pies for us, and checked on us regularly. I stayed at her house for two months, during which we all had dinner together three or four times, we decorated a Christmas tree in the living room, she took us to a Christmas party that a friend of hers was hosting, and even took me sledding!"
The room is exactly as advertised (I specially liked the closet,which you could even call a walk-in closet),and if you're visiting in winter,as I did,you'll find it sooo warm and cozy! The house is in a quiet residential neighbourhood (that means there are no shops nearby),"but within walking distance to the T (10 minutes) and the Museum of Fine Arts (20 minutes).\""
1374466,27203006,2015-02-28,24776373,Kenny,"Michelle is a wonderful host, she was always checking in to make sure we were alrig and we had food. She welcomed me on my first day and show me all the way to the train station and to Longwood Medical Area in spite of the cold and the fact that it was already late in the evening. She baked fpr us sometimes. The house is beautifil, clean and warm and has all the necessary things. I reccomend the place for students completing electives with Harvard Exchange clerkship program, since it is within walking distance to Longwood Medical Area most of the hospitals are. The T station, restaurants and a grocery shoping are also within ealking distance. I had a great time at. Michelle's and hope I can visit again soon"
1374466,45297543,2015-09-01,40041302,Leesha,"Michelle was such a great host and so welcoming, we felt right at home. Even before we got to the house, we communicated with her and had detailed directions if ever needed. The room was really nice and clean, ample amount of space for our crazy load of luggage. The kitchen was well stocked with whatever we might have require to cook. The house is located a short walk to the bus station which was convenient to get where we wanted. Michelle herself was so nice and checked in with us to see if we ever needed anything. All in all, it was a great first airbnb experience"
1374466,46599357,2015-09-12,39404654,Oliver (Zhaohui),"Michelle是个非常好客的房东,很热情。她还给我们做了小点心。房间和描述的一样。房间很大,很舒适。虽然家具有点旧,但是很干净,也很方便。"
Michelle家里在我们之前也住过中国人,还有一些中餐的调料留下来。我们也做了几顿中餐,挺方便的。,,,
有三四只小猫天天在Michelle家露台上玩,非常萌。因为我们在自己家里时也每天有四五只野猫天天喂,在Michelle家喂喂猫,还有种在自己家的熟悉感。,,
强烈推荐大家去Michelle家,"你不会后悔的。\"",,,,
1374466,52794911,2015-11-01,24424227,Vera,"Staying at Michelle's place was awesome! She is a great host and prepared everything for us, even though we booked the room on very short notice. Communicating with her was very easy and she made sure we had everything we needed."
The apartment was clean and the cats contributed to the cosy atmosphere. They were very nice and cautious.,,,,,
Also,"being able to walk to the T was convenient. I would definitely stay with Michelle again!\"",,,,
1374466,56589443,2015-12-15,9260193,Adriano,"I had a great time staying at Real Boston. Easy access to Dudley Station, big room and great roommates. Michelle lives upstairs, so you have privacy but still she's always very helpful and quickly reply."
1374466,75097350,2016-05-18,16566232,Isabelle,"Michelle est une hôte sympathique, disponible rapidement en cas de besoin, et bonne cuisinière de surcroît. Ça fait toujours plaisir de découvrir sur la table de la cuisine des gâteaux à grignoter de temps à autre. Le logement était tel que décrit, j’ai beaucoup aimé ma chambre, assez spacieuse avec un espace dressing. Ainsi que la maison qui a son charme, avec plusieurs chats qui viennent dire bonjour de temps en temps (la plupart du temps ils restent à l’étage). Le quartier est résidentiel, avec un petit convenience store au bout de la rue. Les supermarchés sont plus loin. Il y a un arrêt de bus à 10mn à pied et un arrêt de métro (Roxbury crossing, ligne orange) à 15mn, avec 2 collines sur le chemin. De nuit, je n’ai jamais eu de problème en revenant de Roxbury crossing, et préférais passer par là plutôt que Dudley square. Comptez à peine 1/2h porte à porte si vous allez en cours à Northeastern university, pratique en bus ou à un arrêt de métro. Si vous aimez marcher, le temps de trajet revient à peu près au même. Dans l’ensemble une très bonne expérience de 5 mois, que je renouvellerai avec plaisir."
1374466,76690676,2016-05-29,1372072,Sarah,"Michelle was a warm, attentive host.  Many times she offered to help and went out of her way to take me to pickup coffee & meet the train on my last day. Very enjoyable stay."
1374466,78167863,2016-06-05,72094457,Trevor,"Great first experience with Airbnb!  Had a very easy time getting around by foot with many places to eat within short distance.  Parking was not a concern throughout my stay, allowing me to choose the easiest method of getting from point A to B each day.  Above all else, Michelle was the perfect hostess and was more than accommodating during my stay with her.  I greatly appreciated her help and hospitality and would highly recommend her for anyone looking for a reliable place to stay in Boston!"
1374466,79117238,2016-06-11,70089185,Ramsankar,Michelle was very helpful and hospitable.she received me from nearest subway station and gave clear guidances abt moving around. The place was calm and well arranged for the stay.kitchen was well organized and had enough provisions. I would recommend it to other travellers to Boston. Place is close to airport and 10 mins from sub.
1374466,80916807,2016-06-20,45778685,Wes,Michelle's house is a great staging base to explore the city.  The house has all the amenities you could desire for an extended stay or even a long weekend.  You are close to the metro and there are generally other like minded travelers there as well who could potentially join you in an excursion or two.  The house does have cats who are friendly and make you feel more at home. Michelle herself is one of the nicest people I think I have ever met.  She is always willing to help and is very accommodating.

"Location fantastic\"",,,,,
4875342,25391861,2015-01-14,18053838,Daniel,"Josh and Hilary made me feel incredibly welcome from the onset. On my first night, they welcomed me with a family game night-we ordered pizza and played board games. They really opened up their home and made me feel comfortable. Their pup Harley is super friendly!  Super convenient to the local T stop, parking was easy to find, and just a generally really cosy and welcoming environment! Thank you!"
4875342,26277038,2015-02-08,27007865,Heather,"Joshua was very friendly and made us feel very welcome. He went out of his way to be sure we would have parking despite the tremendous amount of snow in Boston.  That meant shoveling an entire driveway full of deep snow so we could get our car off the street for the night. His house is very comfortable, with many charming and unique features, including a beautiful fireplace in the vestibule and several lovely stained glass windows. He also has a very sweet little dog and that was an added treat."
4875342,37301110,2015-07-06,6149089,Matthew,"We were blown away by the hospitality shown to us by Josh, his wife Hilary and the other guys (and pets) living at the house. After a phone call from Josh and a message with detailed settling in instructions, we were invited for pizza and beer and spent the rest of the evening sitting around the fire in the backyard having a great chat, making s'mores (fire-roasted marshmallow and chocolate treats) and enjoying another couple of drinks. They were all really friendly, interesting people and Josh went out of his way to make us feel welcome and at home. It was a peaceful neighbourhood for the most part (some 4th of July fireworks around still, but I'm sure that was for this one weekend only :)  and a very short walk to the T station. Our only regret was that we only stayed one night! Oh, and Harley is the cutest dog ever and even came upstairs to say hello when everyone arrived home :)"
4875342,38792326,2015-07-18,37788618,Ana Maria,"Joshua and Hilary were excellent hosts, who help out with directions for Boston and even returning left property very quickly. The doggy is very cute and friendly. The house is located in a nice area (with a really good access to the downtown) however the area around the MBTA station enroute to the house can be a bit rough after 10 pm."
4875342,38958461,2015-07-19,1999884,Benjamin,"The Hosts were excellent. Quickly communicated via text to coordinate our arrival and offered ideas for enjoying the city. The Place was just as advertised - a welcome, homey sanctuary just outside the city.  Would stay again!"
4875342,39457635,2015-07-23,24488144,Lorenz,"Perfect host, very kindly and helpful. The house is very close to Fields Corner and there is also enough space outside to park a car (for free). The room and the bed are big enough for two. The only thing that could be improved would be the cleanliness but I understand that this is not easy with a dog (which is really cute as a button). Thank you very much Hilary and Josh."
Tolle Gastgeber,hilfsbereit und sehr nett. Das Haus liegt in der Nähe des Fields Corner Bahnhofs und ums Haus hat es genügend Parkplätze (gratis) für Autos. Das Zimmer und das Bett sind gross genug für zwei. Verbesserungspotential sehe ich einzig bei der Sauberkeit,"was aber mit einen Hund (richtig knuddeliger Kerl) nicht ganz so einfach ist. Vielen Dank Hilary und Josh\"",,,
4875342,39583876,2015-07-24,24067427,Arwin,"In the one day I stayed in this house, I felt very at ease, had a lovely dinner with Joshua's housemates and also got to see a bit of Boston."
The house itself is comfortable,clean and the interior decoration makes discovering the house like a small exploration of the interesting things to be discovered.,,,,
The housemates were very friendly and helpful. Inviting me over for a chat and even to dinner. An added bonus is the beautiful sounds seeping through the house when one of the housemates practices parts of their opera performance.,,,,,
The fact that everyone in the house has a special relation to music can also be seen in the decorations. The piano shaped liquor cabinet and the paintings on the wall are just the tip of the iceberg. The personal sound system in the guest room with very clear instructions provided gives you the ability to create the mood of your own choice in your room. Very good sound quality!,,,,,
The 5 min walk from the red line makes it very easy to hop on the train and explore the city.,,,,,
In conclusion I had a great time in the short time that I stayed in this apartment,and don't hesitate to send a personal message to Joshua if you have any questions. He is very quick and complete in answering message.,,,,
Thank you for the stay Joshua ! :D,,,,,

La maison est super, on s'y sent chez soi rapidement. Le quartier est authentique, proche du métro. Le seul bémol est la propreté générale mais surtout celle de la salle de bain partagée avec ses colocataire à l'année qui ne sont pas des plus regardant sur les saletés. Je recommande clairement cette chambre qui est à un rapport qualité prix super pour la ville. A bientôt sur Paris j'espère Josh !"

We stayed only one night but we slept well (although the curtains are quite thin and let the sun come into the room in the morning). The house is very close to the city center with the Red line, so it was perfect for us. And Josh is really really nice person. For instance, we arrived quite late and had not eaten, and he drove us to a pub nearby before the kitchen closes, how adorable !!"

I went to Boston for the weekend, I could't find any cheap hotels and when looking in this site I found this cheap room in what it looked like a great location. I had never used Airbnb before, but all my friends told me I should definitely try it, so I decided to go for it."
"The description said \"\"cozy room\"\"",well that was not cozy at all! It was a very comfortable room with a nice bed,table,chair,rack for hanging my clothes,fridge
For those of you who have been checking this site for a while but feel like are not ready to make a move,I'll tell you that I used to feel like that and I truly do not regret giving it a try. Tiffany was an amazing host (I arrived at 12.30 am and there was someone waiting to give me the keys),she replied to every email in the very same day and made sure I enjoyed the experience.,,,
Well,I completely did. Thanks Tiffany,I wish you all the best,"hope to meet you soon!\"",,

3050565,14303796,2014-06-16,7958979,Cathrin,"The room was cheap and clean and the location is perfect as mentioned in the reviews before, but most important I couldn't be happier with the Host. When I arrived in Boston the Airline had lost my luggage and it hat to deliver later. Since I had no working SIM card I had to give them Tiffany's number to call when they could deliver. Tiffany was incredible helpful and stayed up until late that night to wait for a call from the delivery company and to send me information on the whereabouts of my luggage via Email. She had to call them back several times to arrange a delivery time and constantly kept me informed via Email. Since I had to attend a conference the next day and was not there for the delivery she also took the delivery and my luggage was already in my room when I came back home that night. I really did appreciate Tiffany's compassion, endeavor and patience in that matter."
3050565,15509629,2014-07-10,17302790,Jan,"The accommodation is exactly as described. This is essentially a boarding house with 3-4 apartments per floor and bath on the hall. It is a classic older building with many original features in a comfortable, historical part of Boston. Hilly for sure, if you're walking, but public transportation is reasonably close. Baths were clean, towels and amenities provided…microwave, fridge, cable TV, internet, working air conditioner. And the halls were quiet– interestingly, I never waited on the bath.?? There is a variety of eating establishments nearby. So, I enjoyed my visit! Definitely a recommend."
3050565,15727601,2014-07-14,1382646,Francesco,"For me it was the first experience with Airbnb so I was a little bit skeptical. Notwithstanding, I had an amazing experience. Tiffany is super efficient and professional. As soon as I mentioned that something in the room did not work (the batteries of the remote control were dead) she fixed and sent me a prompt email to let me know the problem was fixed.  The position of the building is unbeatable, super quite in an amazing if not the best neighbourhood in Boston. I truly recommend this place and I will use it again in future."

Only met Tiffany briefly but she is a friendly, helpful host and great to chat to. Will certainly book again next time I'm in Boston!"
3050565,33706031,2015-05-31,32820048,Devorah,"I'll echo what others have said -- the location cannot be beat. An easy and inexpensive shuttle/subway ride from the airport and not even 10 minutes walking distance to downtown/Boston Commons, restaurants, etc. Gorgeous neighborhood!"
I stayed in room #4 on the second floor. Very basic,but clean and with more space than I expected. The mini fridge,microwave and sink were great perks. TV with basic cable,abundant towels and a desk/chair,too. The proprietor even left printed maps/directions to Whole Foods (2 minute walk away) and an historic tavern nearby,plus pamphlets of things to do. Very thoughtful. Bed was by no means luxurious
3050565,35022150,2015-06-14,10730568,Deepthi,"This was my first time in Boston and I couldn't have chosen a better location to stay. Beacon hill is beautiful and walkable to all cool places in Boston including north end, copley, backbay,  newbury.  Tiffany was very nice and I had no troubles checking in or checking out. She was very flexible with the check out time and adjusted it according to my flight timing. The rooms were sufficient for my purpose and even though bathrooms were shared, it was altogether very convenient. I would happily stay here again next time I am in Boston."

I like the place a lot because of its location and the price - compared to many other locations (hotels) this place is worth its price. The room has all I need, and people around are friendly and helpful. A big thank you to Tiffany for being very prompt and helpful in everything I need. There was slight technical issue and she got people to fix it very timely."

Centre St. has a ton of restaurants to try, whether you like asian cuisine or italian. I would recommend J.P. Licks for dessert. As for the Airbnb, Fivos was a great host. He just moved into the apartment. Everything was as described, and I had a nice bed to sleep in, and the bathroom was clean. He was very welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed.

Room is at the more private end of the apartment with unique solitude which is nice. Very safe feeling in this apt - Fivos is a gentleman, very welcoming, informative and adapts to my needs. I'm a vegan making most of my own food and really felt invited to use all aspects of the kitchen which really helped. He also accepted my (tiny) dog at the last minute and was wildly accommodating.  Comfortable bed, clean-clean place, easy accessible parking and really a win. Highly recommended. :-)"

Upon hearing that I was in Boston early he agreed to meet earlier so I could check in and return to my conference. He was very thorough in ensuring that we had everything we needed and insisted he was only a phone call or text away if anything was to come up. The room was clean and stocked with extra towels, blankets, toiletries, kitchen utensils, and other usual items, making it feel very comfortable. The apartment itself was just the right size for two people and was very cozy and home like. Most things were new and everything worked great. It was nice to stay in Allston outside of the city, and going into the city was a simple 5 minute walk to the train and a 25 min ride. With trains every 6-8 minutes and a 7 day transport pass, going into the city every morning and returning at night was very simple. We very much enjoyed our cozy retreat and 10/10 will stay here again next time we take a trip to Boston."

The location is perfect, especially if you need to visit any of the local universities.  We had a rental car and had no problem finding parking, which is a rarity in Boston. It is also a short walk to public transportation, so you don't actually need a car if you stay here. The apartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay, including central air.  There are also several great restaurants and bars in walking distance. We will definitely book this apartment the next time we are in Boston!"

8735827,58090150,2015-12-31,52134650,Mark,"Absolutely the best host I've ever had. Awesome guy, really nice, patient and helpful. I've been enjoying staying here and would love to stay here again~!"
8735827,58422176,2016-01-02,29444937,Tola,"Definitely would recommend this place to any and all. We felt welcomed as soon as we arrived. It was very clean, very peaceful, quiet and located in a great neighborhood. Not to mention just a short walk from the subway station, which was super convenient ! Jonathan was very nice. Despite our running late checking in due to a late bus arrival, he was still able to meet with us upon arriving and showed us everything we would need to make our stay comfortable. Celia was kind, warm, and also extremely helpful  in giving suggestions for places to visit and sites to see in the city. Our stay was great and we would definitely come back! :)"
8735827,59326570,2016-01-09,52782144,Zoe,The house was far more beautiful than I had imagined. Very clean and classic. I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Celia unfortunately but Jonathan proved beyond helpful. My flight came in much later than scheduled yet Jonathan was there to welcome me in late at night. Would definitely recommend and stay again.
8735827,60086443,2016-01-18,339216,Greg,"Jonathan is a wonderful host.  He is very kind and welcoming.  The place is as described - warm, cozy, clean and in a good location.  I recommend a stay with Jonathan."

8735827,65576588,2016-03-15,44110418,Sunny,Celia's house was immaculate. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was more comfortable than my own bed at home. I was there for a professional development course in Northeastern University and the house was located 15 minutes away on foot. I was also able to access the subway lines at Roxbury not far away.
8735827,66206325,2016-03-20,59607310,Kasidej,My experience at this domicile is exceptional. The bedroom is really specious and neat just like the picture. The bathroom is also clean. There are such a lot of amenities to be provided. Both Jonathan and Celia are so kind and helpful. The accommodation is located near subway station Roxbury Crossing (about 8-minute walk).
8735827,66625440,2016-03-23,55171973,Leonardo,Jonathan is one of the nicest hosts I've ever had. The room is clrwaly well thought out to have both long and short term guests. I'd go back without a doubt.
8735827,67690454,2016-03-30,26299986,Chuck,"Celia and Jonathan were great hosts during my stay. I didn't get a chance to talk with Celia much, but Jonathan took the time to show me a few interesting things as we were walking to the train station together, which I really appreciated."
"The bedroom was very comfortable. Not shown in the picture is a small sitting room with a \"\"big comfy chair\"\" that I enjoyed relaxing in at the end of a long day touring Boston. \"",,,,,
8735827,68449387,2016-04-05,7173812,Robyn,"Celia's home is very nice. She keeps it very clean and tidy, which is important. I felt more comfortable using uber  or lyft since I wasn't familiar with the area and or Boston in general, but it was about a $7-10 fair to any place, which isn't bad. There is a minifridge and a cute little nook with a coffee maker. There is a nice sized closet if you are staying longer. The TV had cable and had netflix and other amenities. Celia is a sweetheart. She checked on me multiple times and gave me some tips about Boston as I will likely be moving there for school in the fall. Would definitely recommend!"
8735827,69517959,2016-04-11,703399,Joyce,"My husband and I stayed with Celia for three evenings.  Her home is nice -- clean, tidy, and private.  There is a mini-fridge and coffee maker. Celia was kind to offer my husband and I the opportunity to eat at her dining room table, which we did not expect.  People staying in the house need to be aware that the bedroom is on the third level yet that the bath is on the second.  (Yes, that is disclosed in the description, but the reality of the stairs over three days was challenging, as I had knee surgery last year.)"
8735827,70558045,2016-04-18,2165381,Carl,Great stay.  Very easy to contact before and during the trip.
8735827,71273773,2016-04-24,5399955,Heather,"Jonathan and Celia both made us feel very welcome. The room was very comfortable and clean. The house is beautifully remodeled with lovely artwork, and very conveniently located for the purposes of our trip."
8735827,73356417,2016-05-08,64332626,Priyanka,"I made a booking at this airbnb for my parents who where visiting Boston for the first time. They had a wonderful experience here. There plane landed an hour early and so we wanted to check-in early. The host immediately agreed for it. Jonathan helped us with the bags as the room was on third floor and made sure that my parents are comfortable. I would like to share a small experience of mine which made me realize that booking this airbnb listing was the best thing i had done. One night there was no water in my parents room, and they were fast asleep, but I was sure that they will need water if they wake up in the middle of the night. I texted Jonathan asking him if he can leave a bottle of water outside my parents' room. He immediately made all the arrangements for the same. Also when I cancelled the booking for an extra guest for one night and I wanted to cancel it, Jonathan immediately agreed and returned my money the very next day. My parents had the best of experience here, I would definitely recommend people to book this listing. Also this place is really close to public transportation, just an added advantage. In the end I would just like to say that Jonathan is very cooperative, humble and the best host."
8735827,74819833,2016-05-16,58326140,Taylor,"We had a great time during our stay here! This room was nice and clean as pictured. The only draw back was the walk to/from the T-Line in evenings because parts of the area I didn't feel safe walking alone. I should have done a little more research on the area but all-in-all, we had an amazing time. Thank you Jonathan!"
8735827,75148582,2016-05-19,63008470,Lugia,"The host Jonathan are very nice . Room are exact as picture show. Very clean.Just beware that Boston is not a parking, driving friendly city."
8735827,75903996,2016-05-23,6703091,Derek,"I had a wonderful stay here. Jonathan was incredibly helpful with information about arrival and departure, the room was beautiful and comfortable, the WiFi was strong, and everything was very clean. Celia has done an amazing job renovating and decorating her space. The T was very easy to reach on foot. Highly recommend."
8735827,76727380,2016-05-29,11113074,Shunyao,"It was a lovely stay at Celia's tastefully decorated brownstone in a quiet and friendly neighbourhood. Jonathan was very responsive and greeted me at the door upon my arrival and checked me in. The room was as described, bright and cozy, with spacious closet space and dedicated changing area, a plus for people who travel with style. The bathroom was one floor below, beautifully maintained with fresh towels. Both Celia and Jonathan were very friendly and made sure I was comfortable and had what I needed."
8735827,77932655,2016-06-04,58640010,Wai Kit,Jonathan and Celia are very nice. Five stars home-like room. Highly recommended. They are friendly. I joined Jonathan's BBQ gathering during my stay. It was an unforgettable trip.

Celia home is really cozy and fills like much heart goes with it. Jonathan helped with places nearby and guides. Home location is convenient and reach to city center and sightseeings is good.
8735827,87301867,2016-07-19,23712827,Eliane,Jonathan and Celia were great hosts.
The organization from overseas for my daughter went perfectly. Jonathan responded immediately and his suggestions were of great help. The room was just like in the picture,it was very clean and beautiful. My daughter Lea had a perfect home to enjoy her time in Boston and the train and bus connection to the center of the city were great.,,,,
Thank you so much,"Celia and Jonathan.\"",,,,
8735827,91702677,2016-08-06,4393037,Myriam,"Jonathan was an awesome host! He greeted us with his great smile and regularly checked on us. He made fabulous recommendations for restaurants and bars. The room was very clean, quiet, comfortable. I hadn't slept that well in ages! The neighborhood, although slightly outside the downtown area is easily accessible by public transportation; it is safe and quiet. It was my first time renting a private room through airbnb (I had always rented entire apartments before) and I would not hesitate to do it again. My stay in Celia's home was incredible and I would strongly recommend it!"
8735827,92238914,2016-08-08,34227346,Kai,"First of all, the house is absolutely beautiful. It's light and airy with beautiful details and spectacular touches. The bedroom is a perfect space to sleep- lighting just right. The host was amazingly friendly and kind always willing to accommodate any need. The historic and charming neighborhood is close to EVERYTHING- the museums, Fenway, and downtown boston- anything place we wanted to go it was literally within 1-2 miles.  We have plans to stay in Boston this fall and there is no place we would rather stay. We will definitely be back again, again and again."
8735827,94380957,2016-08-15,46323934,Jiarui,"I had a great time in Boston. The location is really great, and I found a African restaurant nearby the house, and tastes amazing. Jonathan is really easy to communicate."
12648403,75729738,2016-05-22,50528236,Ali,Cute little studio apartment on one of the best streets in Boston! Place was adorable and host was very accommodating; Jj was very flexible with the check in/check out times and we had everything we needed for a perfect getaway weekend in Boston.
12648403,78043245,2016-06-05,25164149,Kevin,The place was as described. Fantastic location and very clean. Everything I needed was either in the unit or around the corner at one of Beacon Hill's shops. Jj was attentive and very helpful. I inadvertently took a set of keys with me and he was understanding and extremely helpful in developing a solution. Absolutely nothing bad to say about the experience!
12648403,78629345,2016-06-08,73094057,Mike,"JJ was easy to get in touch with and responded quickly to any questions/concerns which made the stay all the more enjoyable.  The apartment has everything you need and it's kept in nice condition.  The location of this apartment is amazing.  Beacon Hill is a glorious urban neighbourhood brimming with charm. Steps from the T in one direction and Boston Commons in the other. Newbury is walkable as well as downtown. Overall, I recommend this apt, neighbourhood and Boston in general! Thanks JJ!"
12648403,79318721,2016-06-12,63937882,Erika,"Location IS awesome. Studio was just as described and included all amenities we could need. Bed was comfy and shower/kitchen was updated. We didn't have the opportunity to interact with JJ in person but we didn't need to, so that was great!"
12648403,80303483,2016-06-17,9283508,Jay,Everything went according to plan.  The host answered every question in a timely manner and was very friendly. The place was in an exceptional location right in the heart of historic Boston.  It has everything a single traveler would need.  It could accommodate two people as long as you understand you will spend most of your time outdoors. As advertised it is small but for that price and location it can't be beat.  Definitely recommend to others.
12648403,81294506,2016-06-22,72298195,Richard,Jj's instructions were clear and concise which made every part of my stay at his place run very smoothly.  The neighborhood was absolutely beautiful and very close to the public garden and the Charles river.
12648403,82028336,2016-06-26,71585632,Kathy,"\""
Beautiful location in Beacon Hill! Very convenient to get to downtown Boston or Fenway Park. Gorgeous neighborhood with cobblestone streets,breathtaking brownstones and plenty to do! JJ provided a comfortable stay in an unbeatable location. The space was small,"but perfect for crashing after a day of adventure (wouldn't recommend for anymore than two people). \"",,,
12648403,84259477,2016-07-06,76245832,Kristin,"My boyfriend and I stayed here during the 4th of July and we very much enjoyed our stay! The location was perfect, and we also enjoyed being close to the Boston Common. Also, the neighborhood was charming and quiet with lots of nice cafés nearby. JJ was also very accommodating and was easy to get in contact with."
12648403,84709922,2016-07-08,24996447,Ann-,The flat was beautiful and clean and the location in Beacon Hill excellent. The communication with the host was good. Happy to be a guest again.
12648403,85738176,2016-07-13,69701938,Pz,"Very disappointing.  The place is small which was clear in the ad but the host had the only very small closet almost completely filled with her own clothes and the floor was filled with shoes plus the shelf was full. There was opened food in the refrigerator ( from a previous guest?) and the refrigerator was dirty. She only provided one towel to each of us for a 4 day stay, no way to get clean ones, and no small towels or washcloths.  Bed frame squeaks quite loudly.  Air conditioner was very difficult to reach and loud.  There was a sewer smell in the bathroom for much of the time. Great location but the overall experience was disappointing.  Would not return."
12648403,87213786,2016-07-19,20358893,Chris,"Great neighborhood. This is a comfortable cozy basement level studio in an excellent Beacon Hill location. Jj responded quickly to any questions we had. The accommodations were clean and comfortable, however we did not spend much time in the room. It is within walking distance of many restaurants and shops."
12648403,88007331,2016-07-22,73961573,Tamara,"This is a perfect location in Beacon Hill! On a darling brick layed street with shops and restaurants! The apartment is small, but perfectly functional for two people. It is only a 2 minute walk to Boston Commons.  There is a small market down the street if you need to purchase any groceries. JJ, the host has it nicely equipped. It was very clean! JJ was very easy to communicate with, answering questions immediately. JJ's instructions to enter the apartment were perfect. This was a great place for our 4 day visit to Boston!"
12648403,89204099,2016-07-27,5132523,Jonathan,The flat was great for one person on a short trip. It had everything you'd need for cooking and was very clean and comfortable. The area is really lovely and is well connected to the rest of Boston/Cambridge.
"Would thoroughly recommend!\"",,,,,
12648403,91323761,2016-08-04,34624328,Amanda,"Jj is a great host.  He is thoughtful and kind and communicated very well with us throughout. When we had a problem (unrelated to the apartment, as it was the result of public works happening locally), Jj responded by coming round to see us immediately and helping us to sort it out."
I would thoroughly recommend the apartment.  It is 'bijou' but had everything we needed for a comfortable stay,and is located in a fantastic area.  Sited moments from the Common and public gardens it is a great spot for seeing the city on foot,watching Shakespeare on the Common,eating out,catching a ball game at Fenway etc.  We loved the local cafes,"restaurants and pubs and there are plenty of stores for groceries etc.  \""
12648403,93810803,2016-08-14,33583622,Patrick,The neighbourhood is fantastic and JJ provide a very good communication before and during our stay.  We had a very good time in Boston!

We went at the height of summer, so it got a bit stuffy - and noisy with the fan and air conditioner on. Other than that, we had a fantastic stay."
12648403,96916118,2016-08-25,77299803,Sofia,"La location è eccezionale, in un quartire tranquillo ed elegante, facile da raggiungeer da ogni punto della città e vicino ai due parchi, al downtown, al fiume Charles e alla stazione della metropolitana."
L'host è stato molto disponibile,velocissimo nelle risposte e molto accurato nelle indicazioni. Il monolocale è piccolo ma molto accogliente,c'era tutto il necessario per un soggiorno confortevole.,,,

12648403,97943503,2016-08-29,74360052,Amanda,"Couldn't have asked for a better location! Just a short walk to Boston Common & Public Garden, the Charles River, and the MGH stop on the red line. Charles Street and the Beacon Hill neighborhood were just beautiful. The apartment was clean and I liked the private entrance in the alley. Jj's directions made it easy to find. Small, yes, but we spent most of our time out exploring Boston so a big spacious apartment wasn't necessary. Thank you for providing this great place for us!"
12648403,98625587,2016-09-01,72775974,Kaitlin,"This place was awesome. Our host provided us with everything we needed for our stay. The house manual was an enormous help. The location could not be better, as everything we needed in the way of food or entertainment is within a few blocks of where we were. I'd definitely stay here again. Jj was super responsive and showed genuine concern for our needs. The host and place are a perfect combination for a wonderful stay."
12648403,99148677,2016-09-03,35575056,Lucy,Jj was a great host. The apartment was even better than it looks in the photos and the location about as good as it gets in Boston. Staying in Jjs apartment was a fantastic start to our time in the US. Lucy and Olivia

It is very spacious, clean, well equipped and only a 20 minute train ride from the centre of Boston. Louie ensured that our stay was very enjoyable and gave us a lot of advice on great places to shop and eat and what to sightsee. Thank you Louie."
When I am in Boston next,"I will be definitely interested in staying at this apartment again.\"",,,,
4489752,22933125,2014-11-17,23115366,Jenna,"We recently visited Boston for a friend's party. Louie and Lacey were great! Our train was about 1 hour late and they stayed and waited for us. The apartment was very clean and neat. It had all of the essentials. The heat in the apartment cannot be adjusted, so at times it was a little hot. However, we opened the windows and it was fine. I would definitely stay here again."
4489752,26815170,2015-02-20,22710572,Young Wah,"Louie is very nice and kind owner. And his house is convenient, too. You can go to Whole foods market in 3 minutes and go to subway station in 5 minutes. You can use hot water without problem. You can use washing machine and dry clothes total 2.5$. His house isn't big, but warm and charming. The neighborhood is very quiet."
The only disadvantage is noisy heating in a bedroom. Sometimes,I couldn't sleep because of noisy heating,but,another bedroom is O.K. I hope that he  fixes the heating quickly.,,
If you stay there in Summer,"there aren’t any problems.\"",,,,

4489752,29042436,2015-04-03,859604,Leah,"Great host. Really accommodating and helpful. The apt is an older type property but clean and tidy. Had everything you need however the heating cannot be controlled and it was full on making the apt very hot even with the windows open. Also TV was netflick only and not TV at all, but had great internet so with a computer we were able to hook up other programmes."
4489752,29603266,2015-04-10,26945256,Mary,"Louie met us at the apartment and showed us around.  He explained how to turn off the radiator heat if it got too hot in the apartment -- information that came in very handy later that day. Though not new, the space was clean and worked well for the three of us. It was quite helpful to have an off-street parking spot. The neighborhood is pleasant and pretty quiet. We took good advantage of the nearby Whole Foods and good restaurants. The only problem we ran into was an issue with the bathtub faucet not turning off after the second day.  We reported that to Louie, who was planning to get it fixed after we finished our stay. We would certainly recommend it to others."
4489752,30029801,2015-04-16,6135820,Jennifer,"We loved our stay at Louie and Lacey's place in Boston! Having  a parking space was important for us, and the apartment was clean and simply decorated which made it very comfortable for our stay. Louie met us at the place when we came in and showed us around the apartment, he gave us great suggestions for where to have a special birthday dinner and the best cannoli in Boston (Maria's, not Mike's!)"
Whole Foods is down the street,you can walk there and grab a hot breakfast or any other food you need. The neighborhood was safe and nice,and we walked to the tram and took it downtown for an evening.

He gave us some great orientation and neighborhood restaurant tips. The apartment was very clean and well-furnished; it was great to have a full kitchen. It's not a big place, but it had all that we needed! The location is convenient to the Green Line, which was great for us; walking distance to so many great restaurants on Comm Ave (Harry's Bar & Grille at Louie's recommendation, to watch a basketball game!) and in Washington Square. We were two adults and two 15 year olds -- everyone felt comfortable at Louie and Lacey's apartment and had a great time on our trip! Nice to be in a homey place after a day of being out in the city."

They were accommodating with check in and check out times, which was very kind of them. I was impressed by how clean and well maintained the apartment was - we were all extremely comfortable there. The location was perfect (close to multiple stores and public transportation if you did not want to use the car) and the free private parking was a huge plus!  I would highly recommend staying at Louie and Lacey's for your time in Boston."
4489752,33899198,2015-06-02,6096845,Jen,When we asked initially if children were acceptable guests the response was so positive we felt great in our choice.  There were even rubber duckies in the bathroom. :)  Louie & Lacey emailed me each of the 29 times I asked for the address... sorry about that guys!

They are very nice hosts and thus highly recommended hosts. They also gave us some explanations for staying at the apartment. They are very helpful and told us to call them when we are in need. The apartment is cozy, and large enough for my wife, my little daughter, and me. Because a few stations, a supermarket are close to this apartment, this location is convenient. My family had a wonderful time at this apartment, and is so grateful to Louie & Lacey. Thank you very much!"
4489752,40196303,2015-07-29,27287383,Christie,"\"Our stay in this wonderful apartment was the BEST experience ever.  Louie came out and met us at the T-line stop when we arrived, filled us in on this quaint little neighborhood and surrounding areas as well. Everything was exactly as pictured...but better in person.  His recommendations on where to eat and go were spot on, we had some of the best local food ever.  The apt is in the perfect location with easy access to everything, and thanks to Louie we knew where everything was.  We spent a good deal of time going into Boston and the T-lins stops were so close and easy to get to.  I am a runner and being able to go for a morning run in such a wonderful area was quite amazing as well.  The apt itself is adorable, very well kept and clean, with essentials well stocked.  We all agreed we slept better here than we have in any hotel (and we typically stay at the nicer hotels). This place just felt like home and that made our vacation so much more relaxing and enjoyable.  My husband and I were here with our sons, 26 and 14, to take in a few Red Sox games and just hang out in Boston..we are looking to move here from the West in the next 3 years.  We loved this neighborhood and appreciated the experience of \"\"living\"\" here for a week.  I cannot thank Louie enough for being just aa awesome host and a wonderful human being...he feels like family (the kind you like:).  We are so grateful for having found this place and staying here"
4489752,40479905,2015-07-31,120945,Chonlada,Louis is really nice host. He response to every detail question I asked him.
The apartment is well arranged and clean. The location is great,"just few mins walk to train. The neighbourhood is quite and peaceful. And the parking is a plus! You can drive to the city or just park it at the apt and take a train to downtown (abt 30 mins). Really recommend this place!\"",,,,
4489752,44591972,2015-08-27,20887937,Inho,I stayed at Louie and Lacey's apartment in Boston for 2 nights and 3 days in August 2015.  The apartment is exactly as described and pictured.  Louis met us at the apartment and explained everything to us.
The apartment is clean and well organized.  All the necessary amenities are included and we had a wonderful stay.  The location is also great with supermarkets and many restaurants nearby.  Parking was also available to us.  We were also impressed with the speed of the internet.,,,,,
Overall,it was a positive experience and I would definitely come back here in the future.,,,,
Thanks,Louie and Lacey,"for a wonderful stay. \"",,,
4489752,44902474,2015-08-30,34782062,Charles,"We were very pleased with our stay at Louie & Lacey's.  Everything was just as advertised and Louie went out of his way to take care of us.  When he discovered that I had forgotten something in the apartment, he texted me and then gave me an address to meet up with him.  There were plenty of towels and the kitchen was stocked with dishes that we needed.  An added bonus was a Whole Foods store about 1 block away.  The highest praise is that I would absolutely stay there again."
4489752,99529239,2016-09-05,77009494,Daniel,Excellent space.  Charming porch. Parking is a real plus. Very nice hosts.
721979,4406707,2013-05-03,5590764,Alba,You can count on Seamless. They'll help you find your place in Boston = )
721979,7831723,2013-10-05,7440111,Lorna,Beautiful clean apartment very spacious with plenty of room for four adults to sleep comfortably. Fantastic location close to all shopping and restaurants.  Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others.
721979,8414350,2013-10-29,9314256,Susan,"Just as expected. Check in and check out was a breeze. Way more comfortable than a hotel stay. Location was super convenient to everything, especially Chinatown, The Paramount, and T which we loved! Seamless T was great about getting us the extra keys we needed. And Archstone staff was very helpful and helped print boarding passes at our departure. Thanks for a great stay!"
721979,36215939,2015-06-26,33658419,Amy,The place was very clean and well appointed.  Everything we needed was there.  The people at the front desk were courteous and helpful.  I will stay here again.
721979,50448711,2015-10-12,7977632,Joyce,The apartment was wonderful. Very conveniently located to everything I needed. Check-in was easy and the amenities of the building were fantastic. I would definitely stay there again.
721979,51171352,2015-10-18,44629136,Tariq,The Seamless apartment at 660 Washington was clean and well appointed.  The building was fantastic with first class amenities and a welcoming staff who were very helpful.  The check-in and check-out process was simple and painless.  Really the best combo of having your own place while also having some hotel like amenities (like being able to have the concierge store your luggage).
721979,52617540,2015-10-31,43223661,James,Was a very nice well appointed apartment that was convenient to everything.  Check in and out was great.  It is two blocks from a hospital and there were sirens off and on 24 hours a day that were very noticeable in the unit.
9493951,56651844,2015-12-15,51230798,Michelle,Natalia was a fantastic host. Her adorable home is cozy and inviting in a great Boston neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again if I'm in Dorchester.
9493951,59350114,2016-01-09,49457200,Julie,"Natalia is a fantastic host who thinks of every detail.  She was quick to respond to any questions I had. Her home is inviting, comfortable and close to public transportation!"
9493951,59841369,2016-01-16,46516854,Amy,"Cute home. Natalia was warm and welcoming when I arrived. The bed was very comfortable. Bathroom, kitchen, and tv room was shared with the other guests."
9493951,64414407,2016-03-03,60816775,Danyell,"Superb experience. Great room, nice personalized touches that really make you feel welcome. Room is beautiful and cozy. A+ for this trip."
9493951,64941680,2016-03-09,44768288,Ella,"Natalia was awesome!  Great to communicate with - she always got right back to me when I contacted her, and was right there to meet us and show us around as soon as we got there.  The space was great - I think it would be the perfect accommodation for groups of friends/couples who were traveling to Boston, as there are a lot of rooms and awesome common space.  I felt very safe in Natalia's neighborhood, and had no trouble finding parking.  While we didn't take the T, it is very close to her home.  I wouldn't think twice about booking with her again - I would just do it!"
9493951,65091422,2016-03-10,57572029,Rylie,Natalia was a great host! This was my first time using Aibnb and I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
9493951,65656691,2016-03-16,17362406,Xaviera,"Natalia was an excellent host! She responded quickly to text/email. Any questions we had she was always available. 24-hour check-in, WiFi info ready, towels available, extra key, etc. Very attentive and kind. She even had a list of local restaurants and things to do and see. Also the house is beautiful, very tidy and clean. Great space! And well located near two T stations. There's also a great pho place nearby I totally recommend. Would definitely recommend to other users!"
9493951,65855971,2016-03-17,59992834,Yue,"Natalia is the best host I've ever had. She's sweet, considerate, well prepared and organized. The next time when I go back to Boston, I'll definitely stay at Natalia's again."
9493951,66211696,2016-03-20,59406677,Sonny,"So, staying with Natlia was in a word...lovely. I hope to do it again. I dragged my friend to Boston for Spring Break. We needed somewhere fairly priced to stay because well we're college students haha. I have to say I was a bit nervous staying with other people. We had our own room but the space like the bathroom, tv room and kitchen is shared. It all ended up going swimmingly. Let me just say. Natalia was extremely accommodating and swift. If I ever had any questions, I got a text back almost immediately with a great solution. She always made sure that the toilet paper, towels, and wash rags were fully stocked( I brought my own). The hamper and garbages were emptied out in a very timely fashion. Natalia was very willing to help direct us across the city. She had food recommendations :). She even took the time to talk to me and my friend, just socializing. She was very indulgent when it came to helping me take tourist pics with my friend while we wee staying there. This has been my best Airbnb experience yet."
The location was great( right by a train station,just under 10 mins) !,,,,
The host was great!,,,,,
The other guests were sweet as well.,,,,,
Thank you Natalia for helping make my Spring Break rad.,,,,,
"Please stay with her if you can. It was really awesome.\"",,,,,
9493951,67718507,2016-03-30,63496911,Adeline,"Even she couldn't be there this weekend, Natalia was a host very attentive and concerned that our time went well. She responded very quickly to email and if I had any question."
The room was great and the location too ! About 7 min of Ashmont and Shawmut,so it was really easy to go downtown.,,,,
"Thank's for all Natalia !\"",,,,,
9493951,69288006,2016-04-10,12011551,Lisa,"Our stay at Natalia's place as a family with 2 young children (9 & 5) was ideal for our Boston exploration! Our room was large and comfortable with plenty of room for the 4 of us (and two small dogs). There is an easily accessible little backyard out back that Natalia explained we could use to let our dogs out. We had access to a well appointed kitchen (pots, dishes, flatware, kitchen utensils, refrigerator, cups, glasses, paper towels, and even some yummy Colombian coffee and instant oatmeal for a quick breakfast). There are a couple of local markets nearby to stock up on groceries. The kitchen also served as a great place to visit with other guests who were staying there....which turned out to be one of the best parts of our stay! (The kids got a kick out of meeting everyone, and all were very friendly and so kind to our children  kids got a kick out of riding the subway! We could get everywhere really fast! We arrived home late and felt completely safe walking back to the house with our kids. Natalia is gracious and regularly makes herself available to offer suggestions for places to see in the area and warm conversation. It is evident that she has a heart for hosting, and it is why she has set her property up the way she has.....which is a fantastic set up for an Air BnB!! We were looking for a reasonable, comfortable place to stay to even make a trip to Boston feasible for our Midwest family, and Natalia made this possible! Meeting her was an unexpected bonus to our stay, and we look forward to coming back!!"
9493951,69615657,2016-04-11,61338684,Sandy,"The stay was nice with the big rooms and the nice setup--bathroom, kitchen, eve thing a traveler may need can be found. Location is convenient."
9493951,69876243,2016-04-14,48226659,Tham,"Natalia is a very friendly host who offers really good suggestions when we ask her for help. Moreover, the room is comfortable and cozy and looks exactly like what is shown on the picture! My friend and I enjoyed Boston and her warm accommodation and reception really contributes to this experience."
9493951,70544389,2016-04-18,4437496,Alvaro,Our stay at Natalia's place was perfect for our Boston marathon weekend. The place is very clean and has everything you need. The location is not at the center of the city but the neighborhood is pretty nice and the commute to downtown is very easy.
9493951,70937148,2016-04-22,67943177,Henry,"Natalia was awesome. She's very hospitable and friendly. The room is exactly like how the picture depicted. It was clean and kept tidy. If I ever needed to stay in the area again, will definitely choose this place again."
9493951,72066593,2016-04-30,10743615,Quique,Sólo palabras de agradecimiento para con Natalia. La mejor anfitriona!
No sólo hizo que nuestra estadía fuera inmejorable,me hizo un enorme favor al recibirme varios paquetes que envíe por correo días previos a mi llegada.,,,,
La casa está muy bien equipada,es muy limpia y cómoda.,,,,
El barrio es muy bonito y cómodo para viajar en subte a cualquier lugar.,,,,,
100 % recomendable hospedarse en la casa de Natalia. Espero volver algún día.,,,,,
"Gracias por todo!\"",,,,,
9493951,72376577,2016-05-02,14040144,Alyssa,"We stayed at Natalia's place for a quick weekend in Boston and it worked out great! Easy to get to from the airport and a quick walk from the T station, the room/house were both very clean, and it was easy to check-in/check out. We didn't meet Natalia during our stay but she was very easy to reach and kept in touch during our stay. Even gave us some food recommendations :)"
9493951,72844426,2016-05-04,29147970,Janine,Die Lage ist super. Leider gibt es nur ein Bad für das gesamte Haus. Dies kann etwas nervig sein bei einer Vollbelegung. Natalia ist sehr nett und zuvorkommend.
Die Betten sind etwas weich da sie ein Schaumstoffüberzug haben. 100% sauber war das Zimmer leider auch nicht. Sachen die auf dem Boden waren,waren staubig.,,,,
"Dennoch Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis ist super.\"",,,,,
9493951,75173660,2016-05-19,13966967,Sabine,Natalia ist eine sehr sympathische und hilfsbereite junge Frau. Sie hat uns sehr viele gute Tipps für unseren Aufenthalt in Boston gegeben. Es sind nur wenige Minuten zu Fuß zur nächsten U-Bahn Station. Man kann problemlos in 15 Minuten Downtown Boston erreichen. In der Nachbarschaft gibt es gute Restaurants für take away und kleine Supermärkte. Leider gab es für alle Gäste (zu unserer Zeit waren zwölf Personen in der Spitze im Haus) ein Badezimmer in dem auch die Toilette war. Dies führte zum Teil zu sehr langen und nervigen Wartezeiten. Leider waren weder die Zimmer noch die Küche und das Badezimmer  sehr sauber.
9493951,75652543,2016-05-22,34080231,Yin Yin,We had a great stay in Natalia's place. She is very nice and helpful. The place is clean and close to the train station. We will definitely choose this place when we come visit Boston again. Thank you!
9493951,76615072,2016-05-28,17021623,Shirley,"Nalalia is nice and quick responding. The place is very clean, tidy and easy getting to T station. The room is exactly like how the picture depicted. Thank you."
9493951,77747599,2016-06-03,20919292,Ya Hsin,"My mother, sister and I stayed at Natalia's for 2 nights. The house was clean, spacious, and close to the T station. We drove there, and it was not hard to find a parking spot by the street. It was pleasant overall."
9493951,78890552,2016-06-09,60346621,Beifang,The host is nice and everything is as described as on Airbnb. We learned the adds from website.
9493951,79173208,2016-06-11,38996070,Laura,"El alojamiento coincide perfectamente con la descripción! Es genial! Es muy conveniente y tiene una estación de metro bastante cerca. Natalia es encantadora y nos ayudó en todo los que necesitamos. El sitio es precioso, os recomiendo que visites Boston! Nos encantó!"
9493951,79908759,2016-06-14,30722010,Vicky,The room was great and the house is clean. This room had traffic noise during the day and night time.
9493951,80072546,2016-06-16,71956430,Kimberly,Natalia met us at the door after helping us park.  She suggested local restaurants for us. She helped us get settled and explained how everything worked and helped us with subway directions.  Room was spacious.  Bathroom was shared between guests but we were up early so had no problems.
9493951,80479806,2016-06-18,48421847,Deanne,"Very nice! House is clean, big and comfortable. Exactly what was shown in the pics and even more. The walking distance to the T was a real bonus. Only problem we encountered was on the first day, there's only one bathroom shared with other people so plan your day accordingly."
9493951,81069944,2016-06-20,49585730,Serkan,Natalia is a perfect host. She was very helpfull. The house was so clean and tidy. Also it was so close to subway so it was very easy to go downtown. I would recommend Natalia's house to everyone who wants to stay in Boston !
9493951,81568803,2016-06-23,43870823,Salomé,Tres bon accueil de notre hôte Natalia. Maison typique de Boston et quartier très agréable. Chambre propre et spacieuse. Natalia est une hôte tres gentille et à l'écoute de nos demandes. Je recommande.
9493951,82837660,2016-06-29,64641275,Michael,Wir haben uns bei Natalia sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Unterkunft entsprach der Beschreibung. Nach Boston ist es mit dem Auto nicht weit. Natalia ist eine sehr nette Gastgeberin. Wir würden diese Unterkunft wieder buchen. Danke für die schönen Tage in Boston.
9493951,85159250,2016-07-10,10650440,Heejung,"We (my family) enjoyed our stay at Natalia's place. Natalia was such an organized and friendly person, which I was really thankful for."
9493951,86685605,2016-07-17,21246207,Yang,Natalia is a wonderful host. She explained everything in details to us and those were really helpful. We were glad for our staying in Boston.
9493951,87045308,2016-07-18,15242679,Heesu,"Our stay at Natalia's this past weekend was fantastic! My 3 girlfriends and I took a trip to Boston and needed a place to stay for 1 night. The neighborhood is really quiet and it's a short walk from the T station. If you want to save money or can't afford to stay in the heart of Boston, this would be the perfect option. The room looks exactly like the image. The beds are extremely soft and comfortable too! We also had an AC in the room which was a plus because it was a HOT weekend. However, it was a bit too loud for us (esp while we were sleeping) and too hot to not turn it on. The bathroom is shared between 4 rooms and there is a timesheet for morning and evening. This clever method totally worked for us because we didn't have any overlap between the other travelers. Overall, it was a great experience and Natalia was a wonderful hostess!"
9493951,87724150,2016-07-21,63416137,Celine,Appartement bien placé à 10 min à pied du métro.
Cuisine et terrasse pour les parties communes bien organisées.,,,,,
Par contre très difficile de gérer une salle de bain pour 12 personnes avec en plus les WC à l'intérieur.,,,,,
"Bon rapport qualité/prix malgré tout.\"",,,,,
9493951,89473703,2016-07-28,26041615,Cornelia,Natalia is a very friendly host.
9493951,90253169,2016-07-31,610189,Marek,"Although we did not have a chance to meet Natalia in person, our experience has been positive and it was easy to communicate with her.  Our AC broke down right before our arrival, but Natalia took care of it right in time before the onset of a hot and humid night."
The only thing we had to work around was the fact that we shared single bathroom/shower among 9 people.  Thankfully,the system established by Natalia worked.,,,,
Everything has been as described by Natalia.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9493951,92461821,2016-08-08,17886644,Maria,"Although we didn'r meet Natalia, communication with Natalia is excellent. The house is nice but one bathroom hosting 4 party's is not enough, especially since the toilet is in there as well. The room and bathroom were not very clean. Despite that we enjoyed our stay at Natalia's!"
9493951,93066852,2016-08-11,83514551,Patrick,"De manière générale, la chambre était propre et idéale pour 4 personnes (et pas 5). La cuisine était grande était également grande et permettait de préparer à manger. La salle de bain était également propre. Le logement était situé à 10 minutes de l'arrêt de métro. Faites attention au parking, il n'est pas possible de parquer sa voiture toute la journée. Nous avons reçu un petit cadeau de $ 100 :-(."
9493951,93323285,2016-08-12,83570061,Laura,"Natalia es muy formal y la casa es cómoda. Sería genial que tuviera otro baño, al leer que tenía baño privado pensé que era en la habitación, igual pensé que el parqueadero era privado y no en la calle."
9493951,93437044,2016-08-12,25578605,Jens,Nice Trip to Boston! Everything was perfect for us!
9493951,95016939,2016-08-18,11829617,Leon,"Although we didn't meet Natalia, the room was clean and didn't have any bathroom conflicts with the other guests. Overall a pleasant stay, decently close to city centre by red line, with a delicious Mexican place just on the street outside. Aircon was greatly welcomed in the summer heat."
9493951,96046391,2016-08-21,70203406,Serena,"Natalia was helpful with communication and providing helpful information via text and in her home.  There were helpful handouts and printouts by the kitchen to help those who are new to the area.  Her explanation of the house was for the most part accurate.  We used the location primarily as a place to clean up and sleep.  For that, the place was worth it!"
9493951,99570524,2016-09-05,49326570,Maggie,"We thought this place was great during our stay in Boston! It was a convenient walk to the T, and the house was as described on the listing."
6118583,31079897,2015-05-01,2274329,Annie,"Nathan was a great host--all his instructions were clear and detailed, and he went out of his way to think of everything that a guest might want.  The Treehouse is a fun and bohemian space, with a lot of character and quirks, while also being comfortable and cozy.  The large and thriving house plants all around the space are impressive.  And the view from the roof deck is even more spectacular than it looks in the pictures.  My colleague who stayed here was so pleased with the accommodations.  Highly recommended!"
6118583,31998931,2015-05-12,13138595,Ab,This was an amazing place very close to the Brigham Hospital (~10 min walk). It is very close to the 'T' (Boston's streetcar/subway line). Great for medical professionals and students. Grocery store/restaurants/museum all in short walking distance. I was here during the summer time and it was perfect for me (I was working near the Brigham). The place is also a short cab or uber ride to all the hot spots in the city.
The house was very eclectic and has everything you need to make it feel like home. The view from the balcony was amazing. The best thing about the place was Nathan himself. He went above and beyond what a host would do. He stocked the fridge,had everything set up,and had new sheets and towels. He was also super friendly and enthusiastic and was able to help me move in and out of the place. His personal touch really made it an easy stay. He was also readily available via phone and text which made communication easier.  All in all a superb host.,,,
"I would highly recommend this place to anyone and Nathan was an absolutely fantastic host.\"",,,,,
6118583,32921207,2015-05-23,32781050,Cheng,I would like to share my first experience using Airbnb and the unforgotten wonderful experience to let my family stay in the treehouse during one week journey in Boston.
I graduated from Boston University in May and ordered this treehouse as the apartment that my parents and grandma will live in during the vacation in Boston. I came to treehouse one day before my family arrived and pretended to re-load the fridge and to have a look at the treehouse. Nathan was already there and was doing the cleaning work. He was really a nice host and had considered about what you would need when you would live here. Sometimes I was amazed by his comprehensive ideas which help to solve many problems.,,,,,
Traffic? Pefect. The house is right near the T-line (Actually Green-line B),which is part of the transportation system in Boston. You just need to have a 5 min walk then you can arrive at the station and with in 15 mins you can get to the downtown of Boston.,,,,
Balcony? Perfect. The balcony is decorated what is exactly shown in the pictures. Nathan really decorate a beautiful balcony,making everyone who's living there feel wonderful.,,,,
Inside the room? Perfect. You can get all you need in the treehouse,the grocery store is about 8 min walk from the apartment,you can get anything you would like to have.,,,
Actually as a foreign student living in Boston for two years,I found that there will be a lot of things to handle with when I choose to rent a apartment from Native Host,but Nathan is such a nice guy that he helped me consider all I need to do. When he was coming to get ready for the room,he even took Maine Lobsters,cooked by himself and share them with us,which made my family feel like home. Really thank you
Perfect place to choose,"you won't miss it if you plan for a visit to Boston.\"",,,,
6118583,38851959,2015-07-19,33537355,Julia,"Michael and I really enjoyed our first month at the Treehouse. The location is nice (close to the T), and the apartment itself has just about everything you need. Nathan was a great host--easy to contact."
6118583,45385952,2015-09-02,10069428,Michael,"Nathan was great, constantly checked whether we were doing well in the apartment. Would rent again!"
6118583,51529724,2015-10-21,717456,Karl,"Good communication from Nathan's first message with me.  I liked it enough to stay longer than I originally planned! The space, although not a huge area, has a great location, and provided enough room for two of us.  The deck really does have a great view of downtown - I'm going to miss that view! The air conditioning and heat both work well; I always felt comfortable."
Other highlights: nice TV,good internet (including getting some help from Nathan to ensure the internet was setup precisely how I needed it to be),"and a nice sound setup in the kitchen that extends out to playing music on the deck.\"",,,
6118583,53508917,2015-11-09,717456,Karl,"I stayed two times at the Treehouse, and the second time was just as good as the first - especially since I stayed back to back and didn't have to move anything in!  Nathan communicated well when it turned out I needed to stay longer. See my previous review for even more good words to say about the Treehouse."
6118583,73110715,2016-05-07,68923411,Matt,"Nathan was extraordinarily accommodating. He called prior to the trip to make sure all was ready for our arrival, and was reachable throughout our stay. He even went so far as to stock the bridge with our requests! 5/5 would stay again."
"P.S: Deck was awesome.\"",,,,,
6118583,83596353,2016-07-03,34480033,Andreia,"Minha estada na treehouse foi fantastica! Nathan foi um anfitriao maravilhoso. Conversamos sobre detalhes da estadia antes e durante, e eu sabia o que esperar e sabia o que era esperado. Quando cheguei a casa estava tudo organizado, e o espaço era melhor do que o previsto pelas fotos. Tive ajuda sempre que precisei, em todos os detalhes, e a comunicação foi extremamente facil. Dessa maneira aproveitei ao maximo o estagio observacional no Boston Children's Hospital, pois me senti em casa!"
A vista do terraço da casa é especial! Estou sentindo falta!,,,,,
"So posso agradecer!!!!\"",,,,,
6118583,95616693,2016-08-20,69801283,Brian,Nathan was an excellent host. Very helpful and friendly. Apartment has a really cool layout and relaxed feel. Very comfortable place to stay. Roof top balcony has a spectacular view of the city which was a great place to unwind in the evening.
Nathan was very kind leaving fridge and freezer full of food for me.,,,,,
Location was perfect for me,"on top of Mission Hill with easy walking distance to Longwood area with a grocery store and and pharmacy along the way. Close to the E line with fast access into city centre. \"",,,,
3522237,52026530,2015-10-25,34373332,Moeses,I enjoyed my stay in Boston very much. Drusilla was absolute darling. room was simple and basic. just what I needed on a budget for unplanned trip. this location was 1 bus ride to orange line which connected me perfectly to the city. Uber was only 8-15 dollars heading into city. Less if you take orange line and just use to bypass bus trip.  The neighborhood was an eclectic cultural experience in Latin flavor. She was pleasant and filled with old world charm. i felt very comfortable with Drusilla. After seeing those hotel prices in Boston she made my trip more accessible so I could spend more towards the great Boston food and culture.  I would stay with her again easily. She embrace humble hospitality...
3522237,69028953,2016-04-08,62174027,Leah,"The home was clean, comfortable and well appointed. The host greeted me at the door and provided help with getting my belongings up to my room. The room itself was well set up. In addition to the made beds, there were plenty of drawers and hanging hooks to supplement the average-size closet. And given Boston's wildly fluctuating weather in early April 2016, it was great that the room had both an air conditioner and a space heater."
The host is a stylish,grandmotherly Panamanian-American and practicing Buddhist with a fascinating story who smiles and laughs often and loves to engage but is careful to give you your space.,,,,
Fun bonus: A lively mix of laughter,"music and conversation/singing in Spanish poured from the kitchen when the host's family visited.\"",,,,

1042420,5436811,2013-06-30,6572006,Julie,"First I must say that I am a French speaking person (from Québec, Canada) but I decided to write in English so that more people can read it. We, a family of four (two teenage girls), were in the apartment of Joan for three days in June 2013. It is a very big apartment with two comfortable queen beds. We could store our two bicycles in a little porch that links the dining room by a door with the backyard. The television is in a room far from the bed's place so it doesn't disturb the ones who are sleeping. We didn’t cook, but everything was there to do it. Because there is sometime a dog that lives in the apartment sometimes, there is little dog hair on the floor and on some furniture but my husband who is allergic to dog didn’t react. We arrived by car and the parking is free on the street and easy to find. We didn’t take the car to get in the touristic parts of Boston. There is a T train station at a 10 min. walk from the house. Joan left us a lot of information about where to go eat and what to do. We found that this part of the city (East Boston) is safe and very interesting because of the multiethnic side: a lot of restaurant (Mexican, Italian) good and cheap and at a 15 min. walk. There is a 7 eleven just in front of the house and a supermarket Shaw’s on the west part of east Boston (at the end of Saratoga St).  I went there by bike and it took me 15 min.  If you’re planning a trip to Boston it is a very nice place to stay and Joan is very friendly and helpful. I didn’t have the chance to meet her but we have communicated a lot by email and I met her daughter who lives in the apartment above us (she looks to be a very quiet person because we could not know she was there).  When we were in Boston, it was rainy so we didn’t have the chance to go eat BBQ outside but there is a picnic table and it would have been a nice place to eat and relax.  There was a little problem with dripping of water from the ceiling in the kitchen but Joan and her daughter react as soon as they knew the problem.   It was our first experience on AirBNB and it was very positive. My whole family thought that I made a very good choice.  I hope I will go back to Boston and I would not hesitate to go back at the same place."
1042420,5644192,2013-07-09,3180417,Marc,"We had a great time at Joan's. The house is very spacious and perfectly accommodated us (two grown ups, two kids). We enjoyed very much the backyard. That was nice after long hot days visiting Boston. The location and neigborhood are both nice and convenient. Very easy to reach the city center via public transportation. We did not find the proximity of the airport being a nuisance, hardly heard any plane, actually. Although we did not get to meet Joan in person, but she always made sure to be within reach. Besides, her daughter lives upstairs and very kindly welcomed us, and gave us all the good tips about the neighborhood and the city."
1042420,5897115,2013-07-21,1187865,Kristina,Thanks for use of your charming home. It was perfect for al of our needs.
1042420,6329278,2013-08-08,4843865,Wolfgang,"\"Super nice, clean and very spacious \"\"2nd home\"\" in Boston. Very nice hosts. Made sure that those key basics like you appreciate were waiting for us"
1042420,6463714,2013-08-13,7322325,David,"We had a really great stay here. It's a large apartment in a great location, really quick to get downtown. The airbed is great if you have extra people and there's loads of space. Joan's daughter lives upstairs and was very welcoming and Joan was always just an email away. We'd happily return here."
1042420,6855512,2013-08-27,4907979,Florentin,Très bon séjour chez Joan Martin.
La maison est proche de la plage (15 minutes à pied),nous y avons passé notre dernière journée!!,,,,
Pour la visite du centre ville,nous avons pris le métro et nous sommes très vite au centre de Boston.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1042420,7011573,2013-09-03,182344,Sara,"Joan's place in Eastie is wicked convenient.  I'm a BU alum and familiar/comfortable with the Back Bay area.  This is the first time we strayed much, and we enjoyed it tremendously.  The price was right, and the space was perfect.  Enough room for my husband and I, our 2 year old, our cocker spaniel, and a friend.  A backyard for our cocker spaniel and the playground across the street were just an added bonus!  The Wood Island T stop was a 5 minute walk for the apartment, everything was very clean and quiet.  It took maybe 20 minutes tops to get downtown.  We'll comeback next time we're visiting Boston, definitely!"
1042420,7848692,2013-10-06,7927166,Paul,"Staying in East Boston was a really practical way to see the city & surrounding area - we could get to the airport easily on the odd occasion that we wanted to hire a car for longer trips, but easily got in and out of Boston on the 'T' for everything else we wanted to do. The house gave us room for everything we needed, with a good mix of adaptable living and sleeping space. Very welcoming help from Joan and Charlotte. Thanks. :-)"
1042420,7923720,2013-10-08,5710000,Daphne,"Joan & Charlotte were very responsive and accommodating with our shifting schedule. We were 3 friends visiting for the weekend, and had more than enough space. The 15 minute walk to the T was easy and convenient, even in the rain. Very quiet and safe neighbourhood."
1042420,8257177,2013-10-22,2013480,Anna Renee,"\"Coming to Boston to visit our freshman at college was fully enhanced by having this lovely apartment! We were able to fix dinners so we could spend more time together as a family, the girls had no problem sharing their bedroom and the wood-burning stove was a fantastic addition that made us feel more like we were at home rather than away. Thanks to Joan and her delightful daughter, Charlotte, for the welcome. This will stay on our \"\"favs\"\" list for future Boston visits!\""
1042420,8637237,2013-11-10,6260665,Alejandra,"Our experience was great. It's a lovely house to spend time in it as if it was your own home. Unfortunately we were in a 4 day trip to Boston so we left early in the morning and came back after dinner, we barely had breakfast to run downtown to see as much as we could before dusk at 4.30pm! The house is very well equiped and Charlotte was very kind and helpfull with tips and local phone call to pizza delivery :) It's a very quiet neighborhood, even with airport and freeway and avenue so close. I must say that I found the house was pretty far by walk from the Wood Island subway station and we had only one chance to pick up the 120 bus on our way to the T line, never back! And when it's almost midnight, you're tired from a whole day ride and temperatures are below 43º, a few (but vey long) blocks looked like an endless path. Besides we haven´t seen a single taxi cab around in 4 days."
Anyway I still think Joan's is perfect for vacation,you feel at home. I would recommend it!,,,,

1042420,11840602,2014-04-16,13556515,Paul,"Thx to Joan for the really sweet and nice home, i spend 6 days there and defenetly recommand this home !"
1042420,13245992,2014-05-23,13768746,Carol,Had a great experience with Joan - emails were responded to promptly with detailed and informative information.  The property was as described and so much better - it felt like a home away from home and after traveling around USA for so long it was great to have somewhere to call 'home' for a while.  We were able to truly relax in this property.  Joan's property is a gorgeous home in East Boston - a very easy commute to the city.  We loved living away from the city so we could meet the 'locals' which gave us a great perspective of Boston.  A wonderful experience all round
1042420,13603930,2014-06-01,6392626,Jamie,"Joan is great to work with, she responded to email fast and the listing is very accurate. The location is within walking distance to the T line which made it very handy to get into the city and also right by a 7-11 for morning coffee. Joan was really nice to allow us to leave our luggage past check out time so we could enjoy Boston before our evening flight. There was an abundance of blankets, toiletry's for use and the concierge (upstairs tennant) even offered beer from the fridge. She had a great amount of brochures for the city and I even borrowed the state atlas when we drove to Cape Cod. If you want to order in dinner there's a Peruvian place that makes a great roasted chicken. If it was warmer out I would have had breakfast on the from porch."
1042420,14703081,2014-06-24,5200864,Susan,"Our hosts Joan and Charlotte were excellent hosts and responded to our questions, comments and needs in a useful and timely fashion."
"The neighbourhood is great and it was wonderful to get away from the bustle of the city at the end of the day. While we had no problem with the walk to and from the \"\"T\"\"",I think that there would be some who might find the walk a bit long..then again though,there's always a bus to get you there !,,,
All directions and instructions in the binder of info left for us were both extensive and useful. All comforts and necessities of home are there.,,,,,
Everything went off without a hitch and we very much enjoyed our stay - I would definitely recommend this rental and will come back on any subsequent visits to Boston!,,,,,
"Thank you Joan and Charlotte for a pleasant stay!\"",,,,,
1042420,15551367,2014-07-11,14147377,Jeff,"Staying in Joan's Boston home was our first AirB&B experience and it could not have been better. Her communication in advance was great and the home was everything promised and more. Great location, very clean and comfortable, and superb hospitality! You'll love Boston and your stay in this wonderful home."
1042420,17509973,2014-08-13,6570787,Guido,"Our family of three, with son of 13, stayed for two weeks in the apartment in the summer of 2014. It felt like home away from home. All you need is available in the apartment for a short, or longer stay as we had. The apartment is as described with all amenities in excellent condition and has free parking on the street with always space when we were there. Within a short walk you are at a nice and quiet beach or at the metro to get into Boston, where there is plenty to do. In the area itself there are plenty of places to eat of have food delivered from too."
Joan and Charlotte are wonderful host,"always there to answer questions or give advise or help. \"",,,,
1042420,17702916,2014-08-16,6013976,Gert,We had a pleasant stay and appreciated the central location of the house.
1042420,18492612,2014-08-27,19253343,Marcy,"As a metro west Boston resident for 30 years I was completely unaware of what East Boston had to offer. Great restaurants, friendly neighborhood, lovely beach.  And I thought it was just close to the airport!  In between residences we needed a place to stay, and stumbled upon this wonderful home among the historic double and triple deckers of East Boston.  Between the backyard and the distance off the street, we felt like we were in a cabin in the woods.  It was homey, comfortable and beat staying at a hotel.  Our dog loved the back yard (and she really loved Charlotte, greeting her every morning with crazed excitement). A fully equipped kitchen and BBQ grill made cooking easy.  Both Joan and Charlotte are super responsive if you need anything or have any questions -- just a text or email away."
1042420,19374567,2014-09-11,19980579,Denise,"The house was perfect for what we needed! Super cute and very accessible to the city.  Although there is an apt upstairs, we did not hear any noise from that tenant. There were plenty of towels and even coffee!  Thank you for renting your home to us.  We would gladly stay here in the future!"
1042420,19785229,2014-09-18,857682,Andreea,"We used Joan's while in Boston for 4 days for a conference. We were leaving early in the morning and getting back late in the evening, so we didn't really have the chance to spend time in the apartment. That's a pity, because the house is nice and cosy, with big comfortable beds, and a lovely veranda. The check in/out was fast and easy. Nothing to complain about!"
1042420,20085564,2014-09-23,5055906,Ambrose,"My partner, our dog and I stayed with Joan for 4 nights. I was there for a work meeting but my partner came up as part of his vacation. We had a great time at Joan's place and would highly recommend it, especially for families or anyone with a dog! We got in late at night, and I actually ordered a book to be delivered to Joan's place in time for work the next day. Joan had the book on the desk ready for me and then followed up with an email letting me know. The place was so quaint, including a completely stocked bathroom, kitchen and TV room. The bookshelf had a ton of interesting books to choose from, and the larger bedroom had a cute little work area where you can sit back and relax/read. We cooked two of the nights and found every spice, pot/pan and utensil you can think of. Parking wasn't a problem at all, and the wifi worked beautifully. Our dog also loved the fenced in back yard, and there were dog treats in the cabinet! We had absolute privacy the entire time as well. Overall we had a great experience and want to thank Joan for having us."
1042420,20377651,2014-09-28,8462985,Nicole,"We had a great visit in Boston. Joan and Charlotte really took time and effort to make sure things were comfortable, clean, and available. The bed was super comfortable and they had great information in book form that oriented us to the area and the house."
1042420,20916189,2014-10-07,3218357,Vincent,"We couldn't have been happier with our stay. The Host was so helpful with any question we had! The location is not only beautiful, but made it extremely easy to go into the city. If and when we ever come back to Boston. We will be returning to this location! Thank you again for the great stay! :)"
1042420,21233286,2014-10-13,21615322,Bev,"I communicated with the owner before, during and after our stay.  I learned a lot from her about being a short term landlord that I will use when renting my short term rental on VRBO 157405.  We really liked how spacious this listing was, so much nicer than a hotel where it always feels like there is no place to put all of our belongings.  The neighborhood was peaceful after spending most of our days in busy Boston.  A car is not needed at all because the T and commuter trains were inexpensive and easy to get around in and out of Boston."
1042420,30373967,2015-04-21,13355561,Laura,Great place in a quiet neighborhood.  Easy 10 minute walk to T.  Great communication with host.  Would recommend.
1042420,32522252,2015-05-19,8977254,Michelle,"The apartment is the entire first floor of a two family home in East Boston. The location is very good in terms of convenience to the airport and the subway (blue line straight into town, very easy walk). We did not make it to the beach, but that would certainly be a nice thing for summer guests. Gaining access was a smooth process. The home is fully furnished and is used only for rentals, it seems, which is nice. The space is very large and it was great having two separate, large bedrooms. There are books and games available to use, as well. The house is an old Boston house, so there are some interesting architectural details (e.g., one of the floors slopes). Our experience is that these things made the house homier and almost ship-like. My family who stayed there said they preferred it over a hotel! The style may not be for those who prefer hotel-living or modern decor style, but it suited us well!"
1042420,33184492,2015-05-25,29594991,Zhiye,"We really enjoyed our stay here. My mom loves to cook. Joan and Charlotte prepared everything she needs, and she could finally do it here. For us, it's indeed a home away from home. Thanks for having us."
1042420,33674867,2015-05-31,21726371,Rebecca,"Joan's communication about her home, check-in, neighborhood, public transportation, etc. was extremely helpful and accurate.  My mother (in her 70's) and I were very comfortable and felt safe.   I appreciated knowing Charlotte had the upstairs apartment and that she would turn on the porch light for us when we were out having a  late dinner."
1042420,34998605,2015-06-14,97930,Dan,Everything was just as described! Would definitely stay here again.
1042420,35359604,2015-06-17,33944716,Braedon,"Joan was extremely good in accommodating us quickly, easy to deal with and her place was extremely clean! Would highly recommend her place for people looking"
1042420,36279110,2015-06-27,19316625,Elisabeth,"The apartment was comfortable and Charlotte was most welcoming. Joan's pre arrival information was really thorough. Both mother and daughter couldn't have been nicer hosts, even offering to dogsit one evening. The location is very close to Boston and the airport, making it ideal for people who are flying in our out and don't want to stay right in the city. There is no place to pick up groceries or get breakfast nearby, so if you arrive late or plan to prepare any meals for yourself, a car really is necessary. Joan is right, you wouldn't want to drive it into town, but there is parking at the nearby T stations for catching the subway."
1042420,38282415,2015-07-14,28657050,Keith,"Joan provided excellent communication. It was easy to reach her and she provided reminder a day before the check in. The house was beautiful, clean and spacious. Very accurate to what were illustrated in the pictures. Neighbourhood was quite and we felt very safe."
1042420,39517648,2015-07-24,36228639,Mark,"The place was large and looked just like the photographs - one very large bedroom, one good sized bedroom, a TV room, dining room and kitchen. Everything was clean. Joan was super responsive and helpful! The T station was definitely walkable (7-10 minutes) but nearly all restaurants were 10 minutes walk away. A good place to stay close to the city!"
1042420,40741670,2015-08-02,6129347,Ruth,"I got this place for my Mom, Dad, and Brother to stay at during my sister's wedding.  They were much happier with this place than they would have been with a hotel room.  Also, it was nice that the host left non-perishable purchases from other guests (bottled water, cereal, etc.)"
1042420,44199968,2015-08-24,9930937,Josh,Great place to stay and very central. The house was clean and immaculate and felt very homely. Joan's husband was very nice and my father and I enjoyed meeting him. I recommend anyone staying in the Boston area to check out this place.
1042420,45429977,2015-09-02,40975838,Chris,Had a fantastic time in Joan's lovely home. It was only 5 blocks from the subway which was ideal to get downtown quickly.
Joan was very helpful and quick to reply leading up to our stay,and whilst we only met her daughter Charlotte once she was very friendly and welcoming,and it was reassuring to know she was upstairs if we needed anything.,,,
"If I was in Boston again I would love to stay there again.\"",,,,,
1042420,46799343,2015-09-13,4065217,Kyle,Such s cute home and perfect for my trip. Nice quiet Boston neighborhood with ample parking and no traffic compared to other parts of the city if you're driving. Charlotte and Joan were so accommodating and easy to get in touch with.
1042420,48231855,2015-09-24,8598202,Peter,"Joan's apartment is as described and the photos. The apartment is in an old house and has plenty of character. It is also clean, quiet and only a few stops from the centre of Boston or the wharf area. It was extremely convenient for us, as we dropped off our bags, then drove less than 10 minutes to drop off our rental car at the airport before getting the train one stop back to Wood Island. This is a 10 minute walk to the apartment, 10 minutes walking in the other direction there are a few restaurants in Orient Heights near the station. This was a good option for our stay in Boston."
1042420,48545160,2015-09-27,2613228,Chris,I found communications with Joan were a little short on detail and and a little cursory and short.
We arrived at the house and found it difficult to get our cases up the steep front stairs of differing heights.,,,,,
Front access is very easy despite the somewhat puzzling overemphasis on how to use the locking system on the house's Airbnb site and again in instructions.,,,,,
The final instructions were very skimpy and when we got in the door I needed to check the Airbnb site for clarity on which parts of the house were for our access.,,,,,
Despite the description that the property is independent,on entry to the house there are stairs to an upstairs area.,,,,
The house was dark and dingy with low ceilings and a strange smell.  Certainly not the relatively bright space that the photos portray.,,,,,
We dropped off our cases despite growing misgivings about the house and left to drop off the rental car at the airport.,,,,,
While we were away we discussed our experience of the house and agreed we should not stay there.  We got a cab,collected our things from Joan's space and checked into a hotel.,,,,
Sadly Joan's reaction to a very polite advice of our decision was to be condescending.  A gracious reaction would have been more appropriate,considering Joan was still receiving all the payment due to our late cancellation.,,,,
Awfully glad we didn't stay!,,,,,

1042420,50480579,2015-10-12,31044058,Barbara,"The place was exactly as described and indicated by photos.  It was larger than expected, and we appreciated the coffee maker with coffee provided to start each morning. Easy access to the T, and all of Boston.  Charlotte was lovely and showed us where to find extra towels and pillows.  I would stay here again when visiting Boston."
1042420,51030525,2015-10-17,5085053,Laurel,"My friend and I found Joan's home very welcoming and comfortable. It's an older home with lots of character and charm. Funky, in a good way! The kitchen is well equipped, the beds comfy, and the apartment is roomy. It was kept very clean and there were plenty of towels.  Unfortunately we were only there for 2 nights this time and unable to explore the neighborhood much. It's a good walk to the subway, which we took easily around Boston. We also drove one day to Harvard and the North End which was not difficult, but parking is expensive. I would recommend Joan's apartment."
1042420,70781794,2016-04-20,1898914,Michael,Joan went above and beyond in communicating with me. I was out in Boston for the marathon and she asked for my bib number to track me. Additionally she left a six pack of celebratory beer in the front room when I returned after finishing the race!
The house is a five minute walk to the T line so getting into the city is pretty quick. The bed was very comfortable and overall the house has a pleasant,"inviting vibe to it. Would stay again.\"",,,,
1042420,74231632,2016-05-14,11792345,Mike,"Joan and Charlotte were most helpful in providing information on how to reach the property from the airport and answered all our questions clearly. Charlotte met us when we arrived and showed us all we needed to know about the apartment. Although Charlotte lives upstairs and we shared the entrance to the property, we did not see her or hear her during the remainder of our visit. We liked the space, the fact that it is surrounded by trees and is in a very quiet neighbourhood. The apartment has interesting decor and it is well equipped; on arrival we appreciated the cold water and beers in fridge as well as breakfast cereals etc. We found it a good base to explore Boston. Local shops are not great and we used Roche Bros at Downtown Crossing for all our food shopping."
1042420,75905379,2016-05-23,67777124,Sonia,Woow! Quel beau séjour nous avons eu et en grande partie grâce à l'accueil et le comfort de cette maison et de Charlotte. Merci aux hôtesses pour les réponses à mes nombreuses. Je le recommande à 100%. Thank you and see you soon!:)
1042420,76934553,2016-05-29,208278,Medeia,Jan and her daughter were great hosts. The place was just what we needed and perfectly located. The house had loads of useful information about how it and the surrounding area worked and we had a blast. I'd highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quiet hide-away from the fun of Boston. Easy to get to and from and super awesome parking.
1042420,79153355,2016-06-11,13250787,Michael,"Joan and Charlotte 'rescued' us from a bad experience with another property. Joan's responsiveness and helpfulness was such a relief and meant that were quickly able to move from where we were. An enormous thank you for that, as it really saved our holiday! The difference in welcome we then received was enormous. Charlotte took us to the supermarket and we felt that we had finally arrived in Boston. The accommodation itself suited us perfectly (parents with a 15 year old daughter). There is lots of space and everything you need, in a very peaceful spot. The walk to the T is incredibly simple and quick, so we were out an about in no time. We also went to the beach to watch the planes, which was great. Looking at that beach when I took off on departure gave me a little lump in the throat and we'd very happily come back here again."
1042420,81167815,2016-06-21,78007382,Jorge,Great host. Fast replies.
1042420,87533111,2016-07-20,43756416,露,"房东在入住之前很耐心的回答我的问题,沟通非常详尽。房子比照片还大,厨房设施完备,胶囊咖啡很好喝。房东的女儿很开朗幽默,还为我们准备了啤酒,很贴心。房子距市中心四五站地铁,但价钱要比downtown便宜许多,交通也算方便。对面就有个7/11。强烈推荐。"
1042420,89134614,2016-07-27,13562254,Ryan,"Joan was great in communicating before, during and after our stay.  The house is in a great location, 15 minutes walk to just about anywhere you want to be in East Boston.  No problems at all with Uber pickups or drop-offs and a 7-11 right across the street.  Loved it!"

The place was very neat and welcoming! Our host Charlotte was great and was there to answer any questions we had. Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone and will definitely keep it in mind for my next trip to Boston."

Il m'a même récupérée à la station de métro tout en m'aidant avec mes bagages. Je me suis sentie tout de suite à l'aise car il était très disponible, à l'écoute de toutes demandes et très accueillant. Il m'a conseillé des lieux à visiter sur Boston et des lieux pour me restaurer. Hugo est un hôte très agréable et sympathique que je recommande.  Les autres personnes qui y vivent le sont tout autant. Son appartement était très propre et agréable.  De plus, il est situé au centre de Boston. Il n'y a que quelques pas à faire pour accéder au métro, 2 stations plus tard vous êtes près de beaucoup de lieux intéressants à visiter. Boston est une ville très facile d'accès et très jolie. Je vous conseille de prendre le pass 7 jours si vous voulez en profiter sans vous ruiner ! Seulement 21 dollars !"

I enjoyed meeting and talking with them.  I hope to be able to stay with them again on future business trips.
4586590,26346267,2015-02-09,24377002,Anna,I needed a place to stay in Boston for two nights last minute and Jason responded in no time! He was able to accommodate the day of! It worked out that he was going out of town that night and I was arriving late at night. He gave me specific directions from the bus station all the way up to his front door! His place is right by the T. It was a 2 minute walk! The condo was accurately listed in the description and photos! They have a very welcoming place and Jason made us feel right at home. Awesome couple! Definitely recommend staying here if you're in the Boston area!
4586590,26646966,2015-02-16,23546008,Rachel,I had a great stay at Jason and Stephanie's home. They are perfect host to us when we travelled in Boston.
I received a warm welcome and even though I got some troubles when I checked in,they texted me to make sure everything was ok. They are friendly and always willing to answer any questions I have.They also gave me good advice on what to visit in Boston.,,,,
The room was cleaned and very organized. It has what I need for a relaxing stay,comfy bed,pillows,blankets,towels,and the snacks
Their pets,two cats are very friendly so I also enjoyed to play with them.,,,,
The area is quiet and only 5 minutes walk to the nearest T(Subway)  station,Andrew.,,,,

4586590,26848399,2015-02-20,27615497,Michael Michael,Jason and his wife were great hosts! I was able to book last minute and they accomadated me perfectly. All the amenities of a nice hotel.  Walking distance from some great food spots and the train station. Definitley coming back if I need a place in Boston
4586590,26953833,2015-02-22,5846748,Frank,"Jason and Stephanie are a very helpful and hospitable couple. They really made us feel like staying at home; sometimes that kind of feeling were so strong that I even forgot to put on my pants before I went into the living room. The place is so convenient for those who drive a car here and for those who don't, since they have their own parking space and the subway station is very close to theirs. The bottom line is I just made two more friends in Boston and I'll definitely drop by next time when I'm in Town!"
4586590,27415263,2015-03-03,26010276,Liz,"Jason and Stephanie were excellent hosts. Super nice,  knowledgeable about the area with all kinds of recommendations on where to eat and drink. Their home is very nice, modern, clean, and comfortable. They make you feel right at home with snacks and  drinks right in the room. The bed was super comfy, but the noise from the street in the morning woke me up. However, they do provide ear plugs if you decide you need them. Another thing I really appreciated was their house smelled amazing. It's also right around the corner from the red line, and right off the highway so it was convenient. I would highly recommend staying here, and I'm sure I will too next time I visit Boston!"
4586590,27648997,2015-03-09,15268632,Tiffany,"They had a very amazing and clean home! They had a very lovely welcome packet, and complimentary snacks! I very much enjoyed staying here. There were a lot of accessible places to go for food that were close! :D Thank you guys! Keep up the good work!!"
4586590,27888221,2015-03-14,28112106,Randy,Thank you Jason and Stephanie. It was a brilliant stay!
This was my first Airbnb stay and I couldn't ask for a better experience. They welcomed me with a room stocked for my enjoyment. All information given was exactly as stated. Transit was a piece of cake. They offered me chili and a bottle of wine on my first night,which is not only kind,but showed great hospitality. They went above and beyond.,,,
The bed and room were perfect for me; clean and comfortable. Bathroom was clean,organized and perfect size. TV/Cable/wifi worked perfectly with no disruption.,,,,
If you are traveling to Boston and need quick access to downtown/financial district/south Boston or anywhere on the Red Line of the T,this is perfect. I went door-to-door from Harvard to their place in 40 minutes,downtown to home- 15 minutes.,,,
"Highly recommended! \"",,,,,
4586590,27938653,2015-03-15,27619508,Minkey,"Jason and Stephanie were great hosts.  To help readers, will breakdown review into sections:"
RSVP/Check-In: Jason was quick in reaching out and getting in touch with me to set up check-in and other details during the stay.  My girlfriend and I were not able to meet Jason as he was away on a business trip,but he respectfully notified us ahead of time and ensured we were in good hands with Stephanie -- which we certainly were.,,,,
Customer Service: Stephanie/Jason were very understanding and accommodating to our travel schedule (arrived Friday PM approx 7-8pm) and was very kind to allow us to leave our small bags at the location for Saturday while we spent time in Boston before taking the bus back home Saturday evening.,,,,,
Room/Cleanliness: The place is exactly as pictured -- very clean and welcoming.  The room was very well kept with clean bathrooms and room full of amenities.  Their two cats were awesome (although my girlfriend and I enjoy the company of cats),friendly and loved to say hi on our arrival.  We had a bathroom to ourselves which is located across the hall.,,,,
Location: Located in S.Boston,it is literally 1-2 min walk from the T (Andrew Station on the Red Line).  I use public transportation a lot so this was a huge plus.,,,,
Other Amenities: Washer/dryer--available but we did not use since we were there for a short stay;  coffee/tea/snacks; HD television both in private room and living room,,,,,
Overall,we had a great stay with Jason/Stephanie.  Stephanie was even helpful with suggestions to our questions on Boston locations to visit when we reached out mid-day on Saturday.  We took her recommendation for Row 34 (oysters,beer,"& seafood) and was not disappointed.  We would certainly consider staying with Jason/Stephanie again on our future visits to Boston (hopefully they are still there!).  Not to mention amazing rates!\"",,
4586590,28084890,2015-03-17,27743527,Hugo,"Nous avons passées deux merveilleuses nuits chez Jason et Stéphanie.  L'accueil était parfait avec tous les commodités comme une salle de bain privée, du café, thé à disposition.  Tout était hyper propre et très confortable.  Bref un séjour au top.  Je recommande."

The house is in perfect location since it is 2 minutes walking from Andrews station,2 stops away from south station and 4 away from downtown.,,,,
I would recommend Jason and Stephanie's place to everyone!,,,,,
Thanks a lot for being such great hosts.,,,,,

4586590,29607209,2015-04-10,10479477,Muhammad Hafiz Firdaus,"Jason and Steph were very friendly hosts! Right from the pre-booking to our appearance at the apartment, they helped in everyway they could to make us feel comfortable and gave valuable advice on our plans around Boston. The room was exactly what it looked like on Airbnb and that it was spacious and comfortable enough for two people. The apartment was relatively near the T subway, within a short walking distance. Their cats are so adorable and friendly too! Overall, it was a fantastic experience as the room was completely furnished and Jason and Steph made sure that we have everything that we need to make our stay pleasant and comfortable. I definitely recommend this apartment if you're thinking of visiting Boston!"
4586590,29766397,2015-04-12,28384164,Jenny,"Our 2nd ever airbnb experience & first in Boston! What a lovely home Jason & Stephanie have! The minute we stepped in (tho some difficulty lugging up a luggage on the narrow staircase up) we were so impressed with the cosy decor of the living room etc. And warmly greeted by their 2 adorable cats!! Our room was super cosy with the most comfy bed! We really appreciated all the little thoughtful extras they provided incl candies, chocolates, wine, coffee, water, maps, tourist brochures/books, earplugs (tho we didn't find any reason to use!) & even a Charlie card for the T! Room size is perfect for a couple tho bit tight with one luggage. There was an empty dresser to put stuff in if needed and TV with many channels! We had plush towels & even our own lovely bathroom to use all with toiletries provided. Basically we could use the whole house area incl kitchen even tho we didn't. Preble St is a quiet but quaint little area only minutes walk to the beach which sadly bad weather didn't permit when we were there. The Andrew T stop (redline) is practically 2 mins walk & gets us anywhere in Boston very conveniently. Tho we didn't get much chance to chat long with Jason & Stephanie, they are both very friendly & helpful. Overall we really enjoyed our stay & highly recommend this listing!"

The bedroom was lovely: the bed was very comfortable, contained a cable TV, and even snacks and bottled water! Our hosts left clear house rules, as well as helpful recommendations and travel guides for the area. It was also such a luxury having our own (well-stocked!) bathroom. And to top it all off, their cats were the friendliest we'd ever seen! We could have stayed indoors and played with them all day (though thankfully for our trip, we managed to resist the temptation). Great hosts made for a great holiday."
4586590,30441499,2015-04-22,24640025,David,"Jason and Stephanie made me feel very welcome and right at home in their condo.  Their condo was as advertised, very clean, and had all of the necessary amenities.  Their two cats were also super friendly but not overwhelming!  The bedroom was nice, complete with a TV and comfortable bed.  I would happily stay again!"
4586590,30604962,2015-04-25,27621794,Rieke,My friend and I got to stay at 26 Preble for one night and I am glad we chose this airbnb. Jason and Steph are amazing host. When we first arrived Jason helped us carrying our 5 suitcases up the stairs and showed us around. Since there wasn't anyone staying the night before we were even able to check in early.
The room is really nice and as it was already said,even snacks,bottled water and a kettle are provided.,,,
Jason even offered to get up at 6 o'clock to bring our luggage downstairs.,,,,,
The apartment is super close to the T and only two stations from Boston Common.,,,,,

I was warmly greeted by Jason and Stephanie. My room and bathroom were exactly same as described at airbnb. I was delighted with the cleanliness of the room. Both of my hosts were very welcoming and down-to-earth persons. They made me feel as their family member during my whole stay. They arranged drinking water, nutri bar, chocolate, wine and last but not the least a Charlie card on the table. Additionally free Wi-Fi and cable TV made me feel at home. I wanna thank both of them for hosting me and looking forward to host them at my place in future."

I would highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Boston. They are away from all the super busy crazy tourist places but right by the T - making it easy to get anywhere in Boston you want to go. I wish we could have seen more of Boston and would like to go back - and if I do - will be hoping I can stay here again. P.S. - They have two awesome cats.

Check in was easy and the accommodations were very nice and clean. Their friendly and sweet cat was an extra perk who we enjoyed hanging out with. They were respectful of our space and schedule.

The app. was conveniently situated,20 minutes T ride from Andrew station which is a true five minutes walk from the app.,,,,
While I was there Jason and his wife were on holiday,arriving only on my last day- So I virtually had the place on my own which was fine. My only companion was one of the cats who wanted access once I was awake,and purred her way in.,,,
The app. itself is nice,fully equipped,and the neighborhood felt safe and quite.,,,
My room was nice,comfortable bed with storage place.,,,,
The one small flaw was the coffee machine that was left unclean,but since Jason left coffee bags as an alternative,I used them to my satisfaction. There were also sweets and small other things to welcome me.,,,

We did not have the pleasure of meeting Jason and Stephanie, but they were great with communication and making sure we had everything we needed for our stay.  It's the little things (like a fully stocked bathroom with any toiletries that you could need) that show they care about creating a wonderful experience for their guests.  Although it is not connected to your bedroom, guests do have a bathroom solely for their use.  Jason and Stephanie provide their guests with a list of restaurant recommendations for various neighborhoods in the city as well as those conveniently located to their home, which was really helpful.  I highly recommend staying here!"

Check-in was easy and we received a warm welcome from them and their two adorable cats (I'm not even a cat person to begin with!).,,,,,
The room was cozy and comfortable; our personal bathroom was well equipped with a toiletries cupboard with everything that we need in there. Do read the welcome pack when you arrive as it has lots of useful information to help you explore Boston (there are maps and travel guidebooks available too)! The WiFi connection was fast and the TV in the room was a nice bonus. The refillable Charlie cards were thoughtful of them as public transportation fares are cheaper using those. We also love the free bottled water,coffee and candy!,,,,
The location of the condo is very strategic - not too far away from the airport and super near the Andrew Red Line T station,making Boston pretty accessible from the condo.,,,,

Would definitely recommend their place to visitors. It is a little way from the city centre but this is no problem as it is a quick ride on the 'T' and the stop is just 2 minutes from the house. The room was very comfortable and they provide a lot of great information about Boston. Their cats are extremely cuddly and don't seem to mind strangers in the least! Over all, a great airbnb experience."
4586590,46157791,2015-09-08,39353626,Brice,"\"Jason and his wife have a fantastic place to stay if you are traveling to the Boston area! Their residence is cozy, clean, and convenient. It's located steps from the subway, which makes traveling around Boston easy. They have two beautiful cats that are well-behaved and sweet. My wife is allergic to cats but Jason provided antihistamines for my wife, and their two cats were sweet and well-behaved while we were there. Needless to say my wife never got sick! As a \"\"welcome gift\"\" they provided my wife and I an adult beverage from the local area"

The appartment is very conveniently located next to a T station - our hosts even had one Charlie Card for us to use which allowed a discounted fare with every use.

We would stay again! Our first Airbnb  experience was awesome."
4586590,70668264,2016-04-19,45509177,Elizabeth,"Our stay with Jason was excellent. Stephanie was out of town. The location was fantastic as it was close to downtown but not too close as to be directly in the middle of chaos during Boston Marathon weekend. It was a quick Subway ride to downtown and the subway station was just around the corner from their place. It was nice having the inside scoop on anything from how to get to places to restaurant recommendations. Our stay was quiet so I was able to sleep as I worried about city noise. And the two cats were great. Especially Nellie who was so friendly. She helped to calm pre-Boston Marathon nerves. It was invaluable having a kitchen, and we had our own private bath! Jason was very responsive to the emails I sent before our trip and also to my texts once we were there.  Overall a fantastic experience. We would go back again."

Having access to the kitchen and living room was amazing. The cats were very loving. They have a Charlie Card you may use, which was very very helpful.

The location is conveniently located along the red line and was so closely situated to Andrew Station.  Jason and Stephanie were very thoughtful. They had welcome package just like hotels even warmer and more thoughtful than some. Had water, coffee, tea, chocolates and oats bars in case guests get hungry and travel maps and top up Charlie card. The hosts readily offered travel tips and directions. Guests privacy were well respected and was definitely a very pleasant experience. Nelly, their cat was quick in warming up her guests too. Go experience this yourselves."

They set us up with a Charlie Card for the subway, snacks and water bottles in our room, a map of the train lines and lots of great suggestions for restaurants. The room was tidy, with a dresser to store clothing, a good bed and many pillows. It was a bit noisy with the window open because the room faces the street, but we just closed the window and used the fan they provided in the room when it got too hot at night. Bathroom was very clean and spacious. They had toiletries to use if we had forgotten anything (shampoo, hairspray etc). Lots of towels were provided. Their condo is a 1 minute walk to the train station and it's very simple to train anywhere in the city--we trained everywhere from downtown, to Fenway park, to the North End, and even Jamaica Plain! They were also very accommodating by letting us store our bags in the room after checkout. We would definitely stay here again!"

Jason and Stephanie made us feel welcome and were helpful. The room is a lot smaller than described and furniture different to those in the photos. We had no room to put our cases (not sure about the luggage rack they describe?) They preferred us to have the window(s) opened rather than use the AC but the noise was 24/7 rather than just commuting (URL HIDDEN) was very noisy! We didn't complain about this and I'm sure we could have had AC on if we had wanted. The drinks and snacks were a welcome bonus, very clean large bathroom and bed comfortable."
4586590,78612881,2016-06-07,63125580,Mary,Tom and I have just returned from our trip to Boston where we stayed with Jason and Stephanie in their lovely apartment.  We had a double bedroom and the exclusive use of their main bathroom.  The apartment is just yards from the Andrew T Station which is only two or three stops from downtown Boston.  The instructions for accessing the apartment which Jason sent us worked perfectly and we got a lovely welcome from both of them when we got up the next morning.  Each night we made a few purchases in the little grocery store opposite the T station where the staff were exceptionally friendly.  Jason and Stephanie provided us with bottled water and snacks and a Charlie card for the T which was most helpful.  We really enjoyed exploring Boston from their apartment and would highly recommend it.  We will be back.

Location wise,the subway was only ever 2-4 stops from where we wanted to be,which took around 15-20 minutes. Very convenient! One day we walked downtown,which was around 2.5 miles,and a great way to see the city! The apartment itself isn't in the best area,but I never felt uncomfortable

The hosts were great and did a really good job at communicating prior to arrival and during our stay. Hosts were also extremely friendly and accommodating. I forgot to tell them I was going to have a car there and they helped us out with parking right away. They had a great information packet that explained everything you needed to know from places to eat to how to work things inside the house. The hosts also provided a Charlie card, which made T use way easier! The location of the house was awesome considering the T was about a block away from the apartment, and the location of the apartment was right where they said it was so it wasn't difficult to find. The hosts didn't bother us, but were there if we needed them for anything. They also had two cats that were extremely friendly and super sweet.

2022303,9852008,2014-01-14,4169517,Johanne,"Our stay at Gary's home was perfect for our needs during the recent US Figure Skating Championships.  Our son was a competitor and having the convenience of two bedrooms, kitchen and living room was perfect.  The home was a short walk from the venue, restaurants, the T and grocery.  It is also an easy trip from Logan using the Silver Line bus and either walking or taking a taxi for about $6.00 from the Convention Center area.  The apartment was in excellent condition, guidelines for stay were simple to follow and communication with the host was extremely easy and always timely.  The neighborhood was quiet, safe and very walkable. The unit is  a third floor walk-up so would be difficult for nonambulatory guests.  This was Gary's first time hosting and he provided a welcoming and pleasurable experience for our family.  We have no hesitation recommending this condo."
2022303,11429199,2014-04-02,11929191,Dheeraj,"We stayed at Gary's condo for about four days and our stay couldn't have been more comfortable. His condo is in a very convenient location with easy access to the subway, close to the Boston convention center, all the great restaurants in the south end and seaport district. Unfortunately, the weather was bad so we ended up staying in the condo most of the time. The parking spot is a bonus! The condo was very homely and comfortable. Gary was very friendly and accommodative. He has it setup so that the guests can have the privacy and feel at home. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to a friend."
2022303,11541098,2014-04-07,12538456,Claire,"Our stay at Gary's condo was perfect. We attended a wedding at the Artists for Humanity venue just down the street. Needless to say, his place was convenient and very accommodating for our group."
2022303,11825018,2014-04-16,10531125,Jayson,"Although I am new to airbnb with this being my first booking, this was an overall positive experience. Gary's condo was in a very convenient location near the BCEC, and it was well kept and clean. It easily accommodated our party of four and was pretty snazzy."
2022303,12116926,2014-04-23,11156505,Melani,"We were in town for the Boston Marathon and had a wonderful stay! When we checked in Gary gave us the lay of his land (beautiful and clean home!) and left a house manual to refer to if needed. Each room was clean, had great natural light, and comfortably accommodated 4 of us. We had great weather during our stay so the roofdeck with lounge chairs and tables was definitely a highlight. The unit is walking distance to the T line, coffee shops, restaurants, a grocery & liquor store which came in handy. Cabs were easy to hail and the drive to the city was on average 10 minutes or less. We look forward to visiting again!"
2022303,12750328,2014-05-10,2407226,Lynette,"Gary was extremely efficient in answering our enquiries and trust us... we had a million! He provided very detailed arrival directions, tips about the neighborhood, where to get groceries etc... We arrived past 1am and were pleasantly surprised to find some treats thoughtfully prepared by Gary so we could have supper and breakfast the next day. He also helped us to plan our stay and recommended all the places of interest to visit."
His place is just as described. My friend and I are both are extremely particular about cleanliness and we were thoroughly impressed by how well looked after the apartment was. Floors,bathrooms,kitchen surfaces,appliances,pots,pans - everything was extremely clean. The kitchen is fully equipped and Gary was very generous in allowing us to use his condiments.
The T train station is a 7 minute walk from the house which made it easily accessible. There are many cafés and restaurants around. Gary even dropped us off at the grocery store one evening when he stopped by to say hello.,,,,,
One thing to take note of before making a booking is that the apartment is on the 3rd floor and the 2nd floor neighbors are EXTREMELY sensitive to even the most normal noises a person would make like walking around the flat with normal footsteps. For any person who wasn't aware of the extreme sensitivity of the neighbors downstairs,we were extremely surprised to find out that  just pushing the suitcase across the room had disturbed them downstairs.,,,,
Gary made a few quick visits to the apartment while we were out without making prior arrangements with us,but he did text us to inform us before he went there. It would have been nice if there was available space in the wardrobe of the master room for hanging clothes up if you don't want to have to pull out your clothes of your bag every day.,,,,
Overall,Gary is an extremely great host and he even went out of his way to offer us a ride to the airport on the day of our departure. He gets an extra star for helping us with our overweight suitcases! Thanks for all you did for us,Gary!,,,

2022303,13207288,2014-05-22,11984293,Chuck,"I stayed at Gary's for five nights and it was an awesome place. Four of us fit very comfortably. His home is open, well lit, and comfortable. The highlight was his rooftop deck. It was perfect for relaxing in the afternoons since we had great weather. Gary was a great host. He stayed up and waited until 1 am for us since we took a late flight. I honestly do not have a single complaint about Gary's apartment. It is in a great location and didn't take very long to get to any of our destinations throughout the trip. He even recommended a diner down the street for breakfast and it was great too! I would definitely stay at Gary's place again."
2022303,13561883,2014-05-31,12132973,Tim,"Gary was there to meet us in the morning of our arrival, he even had some nice treats for us!  He showed us the lay of his apartment, and answered our questions.  Even prior to our arrival he gave me some tips on our vacation experience and helped save us some money! The apartment was great.  It was clean, it was more than what we expected!  The neighborhood is very safe.  I walked to the convention center everyday for meetings, we walked to the grocery store and to the T stop with out any problems what so ever.  I would highly recommend this to anyone, it is a great place to stay and Gary was very helpful to us and great/easy to work with."
2022303,14158881,2014-06-13,10743574,Michael,I enjoyed staying at Gary's home- everything was exactly as advertised
2022303,14631068,2014-06-23,983661,Dana,"I had a wonderful experience staying at Gary's apartment this past weekend! The apartment itself was great - spacious, clean, very comfortable, and in a fantastic location within a short walk of the T and other Boston sites. The neighborhood was wonderful as well. Gary was incredibly easy to work with, and could not have been more accommodating or responsive. Also, this apartment has a truly fantastic roof deck with amazing views of the skyline. I would definitely stay at Gary's apartment on a future trip to Boston."
2022303,14837380,2014-06-27,3103830,Michael & Miriam,"Gary was great. Easy to work with, really nice apartment. Clean, nice bedrooms, great location! I highly recommend staying at Gary's when you visit Boston!"
2022303,15182596,2014-07-04,16069566,Carolyn,I had a wonderful time at Gary's place. Close to the T and far away enough to enjoy the city.  There were 4 us at the condo and plenty of room for more.
2022303,15625047,2014-07-13,5164783,Tamara,"Gary is a very nice, friendly and accommodating host.  He left us bagels and cream cheese and a bottle of wine!  His place is clean and spacious and very comfortable.  I stayed here with friends of mine (a couple) and my 5 year old son when we came to Boston to celebrate another friend's 40th birthday.  Gary's place is about 4 blocks from my friends and very close to West Broadway where there are lots of stores, shops and restaurants and a T stop.  The neighborhood is very nice.  We spent hours every evening on the roof deck enjoying the stars and view.  We would definitely rent Gary's place again when visiting Boston."
2022303,16066935,2014-07-21,15437823,Kim,"This was our first time using airbnb and we had tempered expectations.  Gary, as a host, was outstanding! Not only was his apartment impeccably maintained, he went the extra steps of providing a house manual with items like wifi password and location of nearest coffee shop, grocery, etc.  Additionally he had guidebooks for us to help navigate the city.  Midway through the trip, I called him regarding Red Sox tickets and he directed me to a few places to purchase them.  His level of care and attention to detail truly rivals some concierge services in better hotels."
The apartment is exactly as portrayed in the pictures.  My husband and I enjoyed cocktails on the private rooftop deck while the kids kicked back with cable tv and dvr shows.  The views were beautiful and we saved a ton of money in comparison to what we would have spent at a hotel bar.,,,,,
My husband went to school at BU and when I mentioned the location of this apartment he was a bit skeptical based on what South Boston used to be;  I'm glad we didn't let that deter us.  The area is entrenched in a revitalization! There are some older buildings in the area that still need some attention but overall the area was full of condos,a mix of urbanites,young families and baby boomers.  We walked all over even in the dark with no issues.  The Broadway Red line is less than a 10 minute walk and can take you anywhere in our outside the city.,,,
"Overall it was a great experience and one that I would recommend to anyone.\"",,,,,
2022303,16656575,2014-07-31,9161035,Morten,"Our stay at Gary's apartment was just splendid. Everything in the app. Was exactly as described. No negative surprises. The place was fully eccuipped  for a stay for all three of us. The app. Was not longer away from down down than a nice walk at a fair pace the days we stayed. Gary granted us a visit on our third day, in case we had any difficulties or questions. His upper deck/ top flor with a lovely view was terrific as well as all correspondence we had in advance and during our stay."
2022303,17143686,2014-08-08,14043098,Daniel,"Gary's place was perfect.  My wife and I were attending a conference held at the Boston Convention Center for a week, and managed to do lots of walking around Boston..."
2022303,17349869,2014-08-11,16640467,Jean-Francois,"Our first experience with AirBnb was very good and thanks to our host Gary! Everything before our arrival went smoothly, he answered all our questions and everything was very well organized. The apartment is exactly as described, clean, well located and the rooftop patio is awesome. The apartment is very well located, close to the subway station, walking distance from the South End and Waterfront neighbourhoods. We would recommend Gary as he always went ahead to make sure we were okay."
2022303,17847120,2014-08-18,871663,Kay,"Gary is a great host and my parents and I very much enjoyed our stay in his apartment in South Boston.  He was very communicative ahead of the stay and was there at check-in to spend time orienting us to the apartment and the neighbourhood.  The place had everything we needed (aside from a kettle, but we're British and we realise that Bostonians aren't fans of tea like us!!) and was very conveniently located for the T, bus routes into the city centre and great local restaurants.  Gary was always there to answer questions during our stay.  I would have no hesitation in recommending this airbnb rental if you are thinking of coming to Boston.  Thanks again Gary!"
2022303,18472908,2014-08-27,3866331,Brianne,"Very easy to book and coordinate check in. Gary was there to greet us when we arrived and show us around his place. He also gave a great run down of the area including grocery stores, restaurants recommendations, etc. The location was ideal since I was in town for a trade show. I stayed with a coworker and we were able to walk to/from the convention center each day. Gary was super helpful, and even came back to help out with a couple of my Fedex packages that were delivered. His place was ideal and I would absolutely book again!"
2022303,19357315,2014-09-11,2647047,Lynn,The apartment was lovely.  Hard surface flooring throughout.  Lovely amenities.  Nice baths.  Good location close to the Broadway T.  Fabulous restaurants in the neighborhood - Lincoln Tavern was a favorite.  We took a cab from Logan to the apartment which cost $35 + tip for the 4 of us.  My husband and I decided to try the T and the Silver Line back to Logan and it was a total breeze - cost $2.10 each.   Took less time and we were dropped off in front of our terminal.
"Gary was extremely responsive and was very easy to deal with.  We'd stay there again.  \"",,,,,
2022303,19814993,2014-09-19,15165789,Mike,Great place. Walking distance to the Boston Convention Center. Gary was awesome. Loved the coffee and bagels. Perfect. Highly recommended.
2022303,19973269,2014-09-21,17304245,Gen,Gary was a great host. He accomadated our last minute booking (after another airbnb cancelled on us) and late flight arrival time. He met us at the apartment & gave us some great area recommendations. The apartment is exactly as advertised and very comfortable for two couples. He was always available by text or phone before and during our stay.
2022303,20137924,2014-09-24,10919682,Allan,Gary was an amazing host. He was very quick in responding to any inquiries prior to and during the trip. He met us at the beginning and provided insight into the surrounding area along with visiting Boston. He's very accommodating and ensures that his guests have what they need.
The location is perfect as it's in a growing area that features great restaurants and sights within a 15 minute walk,including downtown. The place was perfect for my wife and me along with another couple. It also includes access to an amazing roof deck that overlooks the area.,,,,
"We will definitely make sure to check in with Gary on availability for this location when we return to Boston.\"",,,,,
2022303,20275135,2014-09-27,14267633,James,"A place we would return to in the future! Wonderful location in South Boston. 20 minute walking distance to Fish Pier. Two blocks from the Red Line. Gary's modern condo has all the amenities you would want. A very inviting host, well organized and informative. He does have Wi-Fi and an assortment of local brochures. The third floor is accessed by an exterior stairwell. Should be noted the second bedroom has a sofa bed which would be more suited for younger visitors. He protects both mattresses with uncomfortable plastic sheeting and had thin sheets that kept pulling away from the mattress. He said he would be changing the sheets, however, so this shouldn't be a continuing concern. He met us on arrival and check out was easy."
2022303,20510286,2014-09-30,20522589,Carly,"We had such a great time in Boston for a long weekend! Gary's apartment is  in a great location.  Walking distance from waterfront, the city, and some great local bars (and if you aren't up for walking, there are plenty of nearby taxis, train station, and for us DC people--  UBER!)  Gary greeted us at the apartment on day one to show us around the house, get us acclimated to the city, and even left us a bottle of wine:).  The apartment was very clean and spacious- perfect for 2 couples- and the rooftop deck is a plus! We will definitely be back to visit and cant wait to check out even more great sights in Boston!"
2022303,20675858,2014-10-03,21865276,Richard,"Gary was a great host, met me to provide keys, provided all information needed, kind enough to offer a bottle of wine on arrival, place was immaculately clean, great experience, all as advertised, highly recommend"
2022303,20901508,2014-10-07,19901257,Jeff,Thanks Gary!  We had a great stay in Boston made all the much better by your wonderful accommodations.  Gary provided great info to us before our arrival.  The apartment was clean and cozy and just as advertised.  The neighbourhood was nice and close to everything.  We'd stay there again for sure!
"\"",,,,,
2022303,21102234,2014-10-11,21976822,Atif,This was my first time using Airbnb and was a bit skeptical. Gary explained the process in detail and even provided a bottle of wine. The condo was beautiful and super conveiniant as I was at the conventention center for a confernce. A lot of great restaurants just  walking distance and the roof top ....you must experiance your self. I highly recommend  Gary and his property. I will definitely use Gary on my next trip to Boston. Cheers Bro!
2022303,21698822,2014-10-22,9205936,Munip,Very convenient location - walking distance to the convention centre as well as easy to access downtown Boston. The apartment is beautifully furnished with everything you might need. Quiet and safe neighbourhood.
2022303,22036108,2014-10-28,22219902,Enrique,Gary's residence was centrally located for our needs. Very close to the airport and within a short taxi drive of where we wanted to go within Boston.A house manual is provided by the host providing all the necessary information you may need and in case you request further assistance Gary readily makes himself available.

2022303,22138316,2014-10-31,20311248,Ryan,Gary was great with accommodations! His place was in perfect condition and was in the ideal location for our needs. The neighborhood was very friendly with restaurants and bars in walking distance. Thank you for a great trip in the beautiful city of Boston!
2022303,23003697,2014-11-20,15540507,Scott,"A colleague and I used Gary's apartment while at a conference. His place was ideal: spacious, tidy, clean, very well updated, and ideally situated about 10 min walk to the conference. Gary's 2 bedroom, 2 bath (+ den, kitchen, roof deck ...) place was substantial cheaper than sharing a hotel room. Gary was available and courteous. No complaints, will definitely keep this in mind for the next trip to Boston."
2022303,23360550,2014-11-30,7450365,Nancy,"My husband and I enjoyed sharing Gary's apartment with another couple when we were in Boston for the week of Thanksgiving. Gary was a conscientious host, quick to respond to emails and to provide an in person orientation. The living room and kitchen at Gary's were very nice. The living room was spacious and the kitchen well equipped. The bed in the main bedroom was quite comfortable, the hideaway in the office could be improved upon. The  location was quiet and though we did not need it the parking space is a real plus as would be the roof top patio at another time of year."
2022303,24732905,2015-01-02,2079256,Mark,"Great place, great location, great host. Thanks for everything Gary."
2022303,27640255,2015-03-09,1425674,Bob,Gary was a great host. The apartment was exactly as described and the location could not have been much better. Very easy walk to the Convention Center as well as the T. I would definitely recommend this to a friend and I'll likely ask to stay there again.
2022303,28169501,2015-03-19,11275022,John,Gary is a great host.  He has a bottle of red wine welcoming our arrival.  He thoroughly introduced his house and the neighborhood to us.  His house is pretty much accurate as described.  The Boston convention center is about 10 minutes walking which is very convenient.  The neighborhood is under major development so there will be more restaurants and taverns within walking distance.
2022303,28375955,2015-03-23,6607527,Brian,"Gary was extremely responsive and helpful in arranging our stay both in email and over the phone.  When he met us at the apartment he gave us a great overview of the area and a lot of suggestions for restaurants, bars and other places to check out and the ones we tried proved to be great ideas.  He even had a bottle of wine waiting for us, which was a nice little touch that we appreciated.  His willingness to accommodate our arrival and departure schedule for check-in and check-out was very helpful as well."
The apartment itself was very modern,nicely set up,clean and felt like a good value for the money.  It's in a good location with easy walking access to restaurants,grocery stores,bars and public transit.  We were easily able to get by without a car,which was a big plus for our group.  The neighborhood was nice and felt quite safe
Overall we were very happy with both the apartment and the job Gary did as a host.  If we need a place in South Boston for a future trip,"we would strongly consider Gary's apartment again.\"",,,,
2022303,30148700,2015-04-18,29822843,Jenna,This was a wonderful first experience with using airbnb.  Gary was very friendly when I met him at check-in.  Gary's place was exactly as pictured/described if not better.  The finishes and furnishings in the condo were very nice.  The bed was extremely comfortable.
I was in town to attend two conferences at the convention center.  The walk to and from the the convention center was very easy.  Although I did not use the T,I did see it when I was walking around and it is easily accessible from the condo. I was able to walk to a lot of restaurants and bars very easily from the condo.,,,,
Before and during the stay Garys communication was quick and friendly.  Due to some repairs he needed to make he did need to enter the unit twice during my stay.  Both times he alerted me before he was coming and when he was finished which I greatly appreciated.  I also appreciated Gary's flexibility with my arrival/departure.,,,,,
"The neighborhood was quiet and I always felt safe walking around.  I did appreciate the restaurant suggestions Gary left as well as the bottle of wine to enjoy during the stay.  I would definitely stay here again or recommend to friends visiting Boston.  \"",,,,,
2022303,30490594,2015-04-23,24462061,Jeffrey,"My wife, another couple, and I were in town for the marathon. Gary's home was perfect for our needs; a great place to relax when we weren't out and about. Gary was quick to respond to any of my questions, as well as provide great information about the surrounding area. The T is a short walk from his place, as is a handful of other amenities you may need. I highly recommend his home if it's available, and will do so again when I find myself in Boston."
2022303,31427345,2015-05-05,27182153,Aparna,"Great apartment! Well maintained. Good amount of space. Host has been really helpful and professional.

I will highly recommend this place without doubt."
2022303,31600210,2015-05-07,805414,Daniel,"My colleague and I were in town to work at our company's office in the 'Innovation District', and Gary's place was the perfect home base. The condo is exactly as pictured, with a large kitchen, immaculate bathrooms, and good-sized bedrooms.

2022303,32248841,2015-05-16,14863965,Steve,"Gary was excellent at communicating prior to arrival and meeting me there for an intro to the apt.   The 3rd floor home was beautiful and immaculate with a great view of the surrounding area from the roof top patio.  The 10 min walk to the Convention Center was perfect, and it is not much further to the bay and all it has to offer.  My only reason for witholding 5 stars was that the second bed is a sofa bed and the cross bars were uncomfortable."
2022303,33295346,2015-05-26,32238627,Amanda,Excellent location and parking was key. Very nice area and space; the roof-deck was great for morning coffee and drinks at night.

Since the apartment has a parking spot and is only a few blocks from the T stop, we were able to easily get all over town without taking out the car each day.

The parking spot is great considering how tough parking is in Boston. The place was clean and comfortable just as it was on our first visit. Look forward to staying again and would highly recommend!
2022303,63813050,2016-02-27,44612507,Paul,"Gary immediately made my family welcome, taking time to show us the apartment personally.  The location is perfect to explore Boston.  The deeded parking spot also proved invaluable.  I would highly recommend this listing to my family and friends."

El único inconveniente,ciertamente subsanable,fue tener un poco más de lugar en los placares ya que los mismo no se encontraban vacíos. Así que debimos usar el espacio que se pudo.,,,

2022303,69142691,2016-04-09,11082,David,"Gary's place was much larger than we expected (coming from small NYC apartments). It is very nice, clean, and quiet, and is in a pretty good location if you're going to a conference or even just visiting the city. Gary was very responsive and told us everything we needed to know, although we never met him in person. Unfortunately the weather wasn't great so we couldn't use the rooftop deck. I would stay there again!"
2022303,72917437,2016-05-05,12110596,Chao,We have stayed 5 days at Gary'home. It is very convenient to convention center. And uber is convenient to go anywhere. We feels at home during our stay. We really had a great time.
2022303,72979534,2016-05-06,30585627,Barbara,"Gary was great in providing updates and information and his instructions to get into the apartment could not have been more precise or accurate.  I loved the location in the southern part of Boston, it looks to be an area transitioning into a residential area.  It was very welcoming to park the yard and enter into a beautiful house with a delicious bottle of wine.  On a clear day, I am sure the views are stunning.  The apartment was beautiful and the beds were comfortable.  I just wish I could have stayed longer."

The apartment was clean, spacious & well equipped. The nearest subway was about 5-7 mins walk away, which was really convenient. Thanks for having us, Gary!"
2022303,74127777,2016-05-13,16853799,John,"Nice place.  Very clean and neat, and Gary is a rockstar host with tips about where to go, eat, etc.  Do note it's a third story walk up, so you have some ground to cover with luggage (we had a lot)."
2022303,78190779,2016-06-05,58096044,Darrin,"Gary met us at the apartment in person. He gave a brief overview of the house rules, names of restaurants, directions to the supermarket, The T and made us feel very welcome. He provided us with a bottle of wine to enjoy on the roof top deck. The apartment was exactly like the pictures. Our first Airbnb experience was wonderful. We would definitely stay at the apartment again."
2022303,78717114,2016-06-08,9480308,Bob,Gary's place was so great! Myself and 2 colleagues stayed here for a business trip and it was perfect for us! Location was about a mile from the Seaport Hotel where our conference was and we walked there fairly easily. Gary had a bottle of wine waiting for us and check-in and check-out were super easy. The apartment was beautiful and we loved the rooftop deck.

2022303,87019915,2016-07-18,20377221,Keith,"Awesome place and great experience. We are self employed and we  popped into town for a few days and enjoyed Boston. We went out on the town and got to sleep late and still got out remote work done. The apartment is more cozy than the pictures, and you have to see the rooftop patio for yourself.  If the opportunity presents itself, we'll stay here every time."
2022303,87419426,2016-07-20,24776806,Ann,"Gary’s listing description was very accurate and although we didn’t meet him in person, he helped us with our questions right away by text.  Since we had some time before the 3pm checkin, instead of taking a taxi from the airport, we hopped on the free Silver Line bus to South Station then took a cab to the apartment  ($11 plus tip).  His directions were very clear.  His place is clean and tidy. This neighborhood in “South Boston” near the Seaport district has sure evolved into a nice area. Lots of young professionals. Close walk from the apartment to the Broadway T on the Red Line. We didn’t have much luggage so the 3rd floor walkup wasn’t a challenge."
2022303,87647123,2016-07-21,83334253,Derek,"Gary's condo in South Boston was perfect for my business travel needs.  His place is very clean, very organized, and easily accessible. He was in touch and available throughout the process and it couldn't have been easier.  The parking spot was a huge benefit.  Uber was at the location within 3 minutes and got me anywhere I needed to go.  Excellent experience and I highly recommend, whether for a night, or an extended stay."

It is very clean, safe and quite building. One of the best thing is that you can go on the top of the buliding. Tony is very nice guy, when we came he had a day off so he went out with us and show us almost everyithing in downtown, he gave us to play his xBox also. Anyway this is nice place for this price and I would come again here, for sure."
14574734,99081041,2016-09-03,25850610,Irene,"My fiancé and I were in town to visit family and to explore the city.  We were out most of the day, so I can't comment on the amenities or kitchen use.  But the bed was actually very comfy and the whole apt is very clean!  It was a bit noisy at night due to being in the middle of the city but it didn't bug us at all.  We were also able to park our rental car in the building. (Very hard to find parking in the city). Tony's place was exactly how it was described.  Beautiful luxury high rise apartment, and close to everything!  We walked everywhere, and it was close to the station as well.  Tony is also very friendly and a great host."
1391492,6799455,2013-08-25,8232005,Maximilian,Matt and Alex are a great host! The house is big and the room nice with a comfortable bed. It is outside of Boston in a calm neigbourhood with a supermarket near by.
The two are really friendly,helpful and pleasent. Matt showed us around Boston which was a lot of fun for us. And the fresh brewed coffee in the morning will wake you up!,,,,

1391492,7527606,2013-09-23,862951,Melissa,"Alex & Matt are wonderful and warm hosts. My partner & I felt like we made new friends! And their family of felines make a great welcoming committee. We were volunteering at the nearby Life is Good Festival in Canton, MA, and their beautiful home was conveniently located. We arrived close to 11p, and Alex met us outside as we were getting our stuff out of the car. She gave us a tour and led us to our comfortable room on the 2nd floor. The bed is so relaxing, which helped tremendously after being on our feet all day long."
The house sits on a hill,surrounded by trees,with a large yard and very inviting patio. Their large driveway provides ample room for off-street parking. This older,but very well-maintained,home is spacious and has lots of space for privacy - giving us access to a living room and tv,two bathrooms
Lastly - fresh coffee,cinnamon rolls,and conversations to start our morning left us in good spirits. Thanks so much,Alex & Matt (and your fur-family too)!,,

The house and grounds are beautiful,the room was comfortable (though lighting was not great) and well furnished.  There was no available space in the closet for us to hang up clothes in the room we stayed in,but the hosts had no problem at all with my pushing things aside so my dress could hang freely.,,,
Bathroom was right next to the room and very clean.,,,,,
In the morning we had a very nice friendly chat over coffee and muffins. After a quick tour of the other rooms of the house we left rather reluctantly to finish our itinerary.,,,,,

Although they have many cats, the home was very clean and even the litter boxes were kept in the basement.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would not hesitate to recommend Alex's home."
1391492,8573740,2013-11-05,2187627,Nelia,Very good and helpful family. But the cost is unreasonably high for such conditions.
1391492,8683345,2013-11-11,9898285,Jack,My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay with Alex and Matt. Their house is an absolute gem. Alex was so helpful in giving us dinner suggestions for restaurants in nearby JP and also with our weekend travel tips into downtown Boston so we could meet friends for lunch. We found the room cozy and the bed  incredibly comfortable. The second story room faces the backyard and was perfectly quiet (great for sleeping). I loved all of their furry friends who were so friendly and funny. We spent the evening with Alex and Matt in front of their living room fireplace chatting for a few hours. It really felt like we stayed with old friends for a night.
"In the morning Alex and Matt made delicious coffee and pumpkin loaf bread for breakfast. It was the perfect experience for our weekend getaway.\"",,,,,

While we were staying with them, the last of this winter's 9 feet of snow finished melting (with a little help from Matt and his snowplow!).  That they could be so upbeat and positive after going through that kind of winter was amazing to me!"
The room was quite comfortable and was accurately reflected by the picture for the listing.  Alex generously provided an Aerobed so that my son could have his own sleeping space,and the bed pictured was extremely comfortable.  The house reflected the character of a 100+year old homestead while still providing adequate modern comforts.  The bathroom was totally modernized and very appealing.  For those needing Internet access,we can happily report that the wifi signal was easily accessed and very strong.  While I'm more of a dog person,the six cats were lots of fun,and added to the ambience of our visit.,
I grew up in a neighborhood decades ago just on the other side of town,"so it was wonderful to get to \"\"go back home\"\" and be accommodated by such wonderful hosts.

I was participating in a conference, so we looked forward to returning each evening to a warm greeting from our hosts, a friendly purr from the furry housemates, and an immensely comfortable, cozy room. We appreciated the bathroom just round the corner; the bedside reading lamp; the mint infused drinking water (!); and the beautiful gardens.

And their cats are very cute and friendly!! 这套房子很不错,主人很贴心,房子很好看,住的非常舒服。尤其是猫猫们超级亲人的!强烈推荐大家来住喔"
1391492,76482933,2016-05-27,67913151,Henrik,We really enjoyed our stay at Alex's airbnb. Alex and her husband were very helpful and they gave us information on how to get to Boston downtown and what to do there. The accommodation was very clean and the cats were also a big plus :) I'm really looking forward to coming to Boston again in the future!
1391492,77668676,2016-06-02,74540083,Stephanie,"Loved our stay! Alex was very welcoming and accommodating. We had asked if we could leave our car there after check out because we wanted to do some venturing. Alex had no problem making that arrangement. Everything was just as we had expected. We felt extremely comfortable staying in their beautiful home. The room was perfect and well kept. Loved that there was toiletries available too. First timer here, so we were a little apprehensive to stay in a strangers home, but I never once felt uncomfortable. I flew in to Logan airport, and chose to take public transportation to her home which wasnt exactly a hassle, just lengthy. A cab ride would have been easier but quite pricey. (something I was trying to determime while booking a room in case anyone else has a similar situation!) All in all we were very pleased and would most certainly return and reccommend! Thanks for the wonderful stay!"
1391492,77892128,2016-06-04,14870652,Cristalle,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying here.  The house was tucked away on a quiet street with plenty of parking.  The room was large and had a very comfortable bed.  We loved the cats!  They were so friendly and oh-so-adorable ^_^.  Alex was very nice, easy to communicate with and very accommodating.  Highly recommend."
1391492,78127926,2016-06-05,37776682,Benjamin,Great neighborhood. We were there to basically sleep and went out all day. The accommodations were fine and the price was fair. Zero issues or concerns. I would recommend to anyone traveling to the Boston area.
1391492,81767190,2016-06-25,75479505,동수,"Yes, they did. We didn't experience any difficulty finding their place."
1391492,82887443,2016-06-30,63143969,Cheyenne,"We found the bedroom and bathroom to be clean, fully provisioned, and organized. The home is situated in a quiet residential area and provided a lovely view of the surrounding gardens. Parking was reliable and conveniently located and the area was close to local tourist attractions. Nighttime noise levels were comfortable and the neighborhood felt very safe.   We found Alex and her husband to be hospitable and friendly.  We did, however, feel that additional house rules that were not initially disclosed on the internet listing felt somewhat restrictive.  Although the rules were neither extreme nor inappropriate, they did add an unexpected level of inconvenience. The temperature in the room could also get slightly hot at not, but not unbearably so."
1391492,83385306,2016-07-02,28012593,Leah,"We had a fantastic stay with Alex and Matt, they are lovely people and they gave us the warm Boston welcome we were hoping for. There's so much to see in the area (a car is necessary) and we loved it. We would recommend the 50s diner for breakfast and the JFK museum. The room was ideal and the bathroom was always free for us to use. Thank you so much guys for a great time."
1391492,83699142,2016-07-04,70154402,Lisa,We had a great stay. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Both Alex and her husband were really nice. They provided coffee and helped us out with parking around the city.
1391492,86012442,2016-07-14,81424886,Charlighne,"My cousin and I had a nice stay at Alex's place. Alex and her husband were very nice and good hosts. The place/room was as described. She had a quilt, towels and toiletries available for us. The place was very quiet. We were able to sleep in and come and go as we needed. Also, they allowed us to park our car even after check out so that we could continue to tour the city. I would recommend this place for people who need a quiet, convenient place while visiting Boston. I look forward to staying here again."
1391492,87405074,2016-07-20,82292112,Aki,Great host! The whole experience was impeccable!

1391492,93803450,2016-08-14,79463221,Andrew,It was a pleasure to stay in the house of Matt and Alex. They were very kind and considerate to me. The description of the room and the house matched perfectly with the real room and the house.
I highly recommend this place to anyone who's visiting Boston Area.,,,,,
Lastly,I would like to express my gratitude to both Alex and Matt!,,,,
"I hope to see you again! Take care!\"",,,,,
1391492,94975887,2016-08-17,83040881,Eliana,Both Alex and her husband are very nice people. We didn't like the cat smell right in the moment we went in the house and they let the cats hang on the bed we supposed to sleep. Also the AC seemed to went off in the middle of the night.
1391492,95383844,2016-08-19,85446935,Marvin,"We stayed at Alex place for 2 nights and are totally happy that we have chosen it. The bed was comfy, the room was very nice and the host and her husband are super friendly."
1391492,96973822,2016-08-25,33996252,Andre,Very comfortable and quiet  stay in the southern part of Boston.
1391492,97523777,2016-08-27,11422669,Scott,Alex's home was beautiful and spacious.  They were both very welcoming and inviting.  It was a comfortable place to stay on the edge of Boston.
7929879,49677181,2015-10-05,34865934,Rachelle,"There was a big hiccup with us receiving our arrival information. Usually I contact the host in advance, but because the confirmation email we received said we'd receive the info within 48 hours of arrival, I didn't reach out to them."
Unfortunately we were traveling a lot during the 48 hrs prior to our arrival and I wasn't able to check in to make sure we received anything until we were a about 2 hrs away from check in time,and I realized we hadn't received the access codes. I emailed and called,but didn't receive a prompt response. After waiting a couple hrs,we had to reach out to Airbnb who was able to reach out to the hosts via separate contact info (not provided in his listing info),and we were able to get in (5 hrs after check in).,
It was a huge inconvenience,so although our stay was still pretty great once we finally got in,we were so tired and just wanted our room at the check in time,and that's why I only give it 4 stars. Apparently there was some issue with them emailing us the info through Airbnb as Airbnb blocked it,but their listing said they'd email it through whatever email you had on account. Just make sure you get the info before you start your travels.,
Aside from that,the location couldn't be more perfect. It was SOOOO easy to get out of the hostel,cross the street,and jump on the T and go anywhere you wanted. My boyfriend was worried because when he was living in Boston a few years ago,South Boston wasn't a great area. But after seeing it and talking to a few friends of his,the city put a bunch of money and revamped the area. I felt safe
7929879,52404179,2015-10-29,43227897,Rebecca,"The location was absolutely perfect.  Very close to the T-station and restaurants, etc.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  Public areas and restrooms were very modern and spotless.  Shared bathrooms were no problem.  I would absolutely recommend this and stay there again."

7929879,66619551,2016-03-23,26419446,Jeff,Listing was exactly as described and exactly what I needed.  Would definitely recommend. A special shoutout to the guy who does the cleaning for not only providing me a spotless room but also tracking me down while I was waiting for my cab to the airport to let me know I'd left my wallet in the room.
7929879,73853324,2016-05-10,5224374,Knira,We did not get to meet Will during our stay but the room was just as described. Clean and in a good location near the red line of the T. I would definitely stay again. Thank you for having us.
7929879,75051912,2016-05-18,68369441,Lena,"Small but nice, clean room."

7874552,50331013,2015-10-11,44276665,Ian,"Arthur's apartment could not have been in a cooler area. It's walking distance to pretty much everywhere and close to the T to get you anywhere else you want to go. We only saw Arthur a few times, but when we did he was extremely helpful and gave great advice as to where to go and what to eat."
"The room was clean and the bed was comfy. Great place to stay!\"",,,,,
7874552,52072043,2015-10-26,1870229,Erik,Arthur was a gracious host and his place is in a fantastic location. He provided us with great recommendations on places to eat and things to do. Would highly recommend it if you're looking to stay in Beacon Hill.
7874552,52511345,2015-10-30,12636258,Katrina,Reserved for my parents. They thought arthur was a wonderful and very accommodating host. Would stay there again.
7874552,52891165,2015-11-02,41423350,Katy,Arthur's place is centrally located and very convenient for those eager to explore the city. The space was clean and afforded privacy. Arthur was available to answer questions if needed and very helpful. I would definitely book again!
7874552,53090491,2015-11-04,3832800,David,"Arthurs apartment was an enjoyable place to stay.  Arthur, who is very friendly and easy going, lives there (unlike some airbnb listings) and we enjoyed several enjoyable conversations.  He also provided some good tips on nearby coffee shops, bakeries (both just across the street and excellent) as well as places to eat/things to do. The listing was as advertised and in a very central location (historic old part of town).  It was also quiet at night. The subway system is a 5 min walk away; the river even closer. Recommended."
7874552,53278600,2015-11-07,20410856,Abbie,"Amazing location! My husband and I stayed with Arthur for 3 nights. It was a perfect base for exploring the city. Great food options right outside your door. It's a historic part of town, so you have to know the apartment is quirky before you book. It's a little noisy with creaky floors and older bathroom. Arthur is super fun and outgoing. By far, the best value for the money."
7874552,53977822,2015-11-15,16772469,Susan,This is a perfect location matched with a wonderful apartment and terrific host. Had a lovely room and enjoyed being in the living room to relax too.

7874552,55645888,2015-12-03,15584891,Le,Me & wife booked Arthur's place for 3 nights stay.
Location: great location,within walking distance to Boston common and everything. Apt. is less than 5 mins walking to Charles St. and less than 10 mins walking to Park Str. Station.,,,,
Apartment: quite big. However,apt is located on 3rd floor with no lift and the stair is very stiff & small. This apparently is quite typical for these type of old building in Boston.,,,,
Room: is clean,comfortable and actually quite bigger than as shown on picture. However,it's an old building and apartment,so the floor is noisy and will take sometimes getting used to it.,,
Host: Arthur is very friendly. We got quite a few suitcases and he greatly helped us got them up to the apartment. He also pointed us to The Paramount which is across the street from the apartment and (maybe) has the best American breakfast in Boston.,,,,,
Overall,"this list is quite good value for the money.\"",,,,
7874552,60885811,2016-01-29,50747709,Gracie,I stayed at Arthur's room for a month while working at mass general.
The apartment was awesome! The room I stayed in was really nice,the bed was super comfortable,there was lots of space for my clothes and other items,and a nice desk with a comfy chair and TV that could be hooked up to a computer!,,
The location of the apartment cannot be beat! Charles Street is the heart of Beacon Hill and super convenient to two T stops,walking distance to the North End,and right near Newburry street.,,,
Arthur was a wonderful host! I had a great time getting to know him,he made for a great roommate!,,,,

7874552,64525356,2016-03-05,17701320,Lee,"We enjoyed our stay in Boston with Arthur.  Arthur is a great host, very accomodating and friendly with a dive and suggestions.  The room is in a shared space so you will be sharing common facilities with others.  The building is old and amenities suitable but basic.  We stayed I winter and the apartment was warm and cozy throughout.  The best part of this place is its location and area which are central and provide easy access to everywhere you want to go in Boston.  It's ideal for one or two people who are sociable and easy going, not a quiet private retreat."
7874552,68747136,2016-04-06,60830616,Maria Gabriela,"Arthur is a very nice host, gave good tips about what to do in Boston. We got everything we needed inside and outside the house.The location for me was the best."
The floor of the apartment makes noise when you walk,but it is an old building,with walls that you can hear,very typical of Boston these buildings,so we didn't care much about the noise.,

7874552,69108512,2016-04-09,27654540,Ana María,Everything was perfect at Arthur´s department. The house is located in a very nice zone of Boston. Beacon Hill is a really quite zone and there are many bars and restaurants to go.

The flat is a typical Beacon Hill apartment. A bit old and the hardwood floor cracks,but that's what makes it charm!,,,,
It's ideally located to easily walk around all over the city.,,,,,
Arthur has plenty of great recommendations to share on where to have a drink or a nice dinner.,,,,,
The bedroom is simple and includes everything needed,most importantly a very comfy bed.,,,,
The kitchen is fine and also practical.,,,,,
3 bedrooms to share the bathroom,"but \"\"the crowd\"\" flows perfectly!",,,,

7874552,79916192,2016-06-15,73681704,Suzanne Joceline,"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was more than I had hoped for. Arthur and his partner were very, very welcoming (even when I arrived at 2am!) and gave me great advice on places to visit and where to eat. The apartment itself was situated on a nice street with easy access to public transport within a 5-10 minute walk, depending on which T-station you need. There were multiple good places to eat in the street itself, although some cheaper places could be found within a 15 minute walk radius."
"The apartment was very light and the room was comfortable and clean (with more than enough space for two people). Highly recommended!\"",,,,,
7874552,80301828,2016-06-17,14485130,Kenneth,"This was a very unfortunate experience.  While the neighborhood was wonderful, staying at Arthur's was a less than pleasant.  Arthur was never there, but I was greeted by a surprised friend of his who was staying there with another friend.  Their very loud conversations in the middle of the night were impossible to sleep through.  After one night I left to stay in a hotel because  I needed to get some sleep and I didn't know if there would be another night like the first.  Arthur's response to this was less than considerate to the point of being curt.  He refused to refund the one night that I did not stay there.  Now as to the accommodations: sketchy at best.  Limited privacy, college dorm room aesthetic, 3 flights up of very tight stairs with no elevator, bathroom overflowing with male toiletries of every description, and worse of all, every sound made throughout the apartment was clearly heard in the room. Really bad.  A woman would definitely not feel comfortable here.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  There are plenty of other airbnb locations that are much better and much less expensive."
7874552,80902269,2016-06-20,41154135,Nick,"Arthur is a complete airbnb veteran. We felt right at home from the get-go. The location of his place is phenomal. If you want a low risk, high reward trip to boston, you can't go wrong staying with Arthur"
7874552,89815414,2016-07-30,2125628,Leslie,"Arthur was a wonderful host! I arrived after 20+ hours of traveling and was greeted with a shower, a mixed drink, a poetry reading, and lovely conversation. The apartment has a very friendly vibe with a social living room, while being perfectly quiet in the bedrooms. Arthur also helped me coordinate deliveries of two large boxes during my stay, which truly went above and beyond what I would normally ask a host. The room is clean and bed comfortable and location is amazing. You can walk pretty much everywhere. I would definitely try to stay here again next time I'm in Boston."

11626869,80096768,2016-06-16,74622017,Vivian,"The room looks exactly like the picture, only the bed, and a small, old desk and chair, which is the worst room I have lived in Airbnb.  And the price is expensive, compared with its room.  And we don't feel welcome there, because I have lived there for about 5 days and I don't even know my host's name!  And when we came there, his wife just opened the door and let us in and didn't even ask whether we need help to carry our baggage!  And after we moved in, she told us that we could buy a bottle of water for one dollar from her!  I can't believe what she said!  I traveled around the east of America for about half month and most of living place I found is from Airbnb.  Most of hosts are really nice and make us feel welcome and comfortable.  All in all, I really do not recommend this place to all of you!  我非常不推荐这个地方给你们!"

You share the kitchen and the bathroom with the family (All of it is in a very good shape). The hosts made us feel welcome at their house and let us try their delicious food.
The place has good access to the public transit. It is a short walk to the bus station,then a short ride to the Metro and then you take the Orange line to get downtown.,,,,
Big supermarkets are in walking distance as well as some restaurants.,,,,,

The room is exactly what pictures show. Very clean and comfotable. The bathroom right across the room is clean too. The location is fine. It is close to the bus stop like in 3-5 Mins by walk. The bus takes you to the Forest Hill train and bus station in 15 mins. From the station you can access to any tourist attraction by subway. Thanks for the nice stay CK! I definitely reccomend to stay here.

He offered free Wi-Fi, toothbrushes, and water bottles out of the generosity of his heart. I was taken aback when I found the space was within a full family's home, but they all gave us space and privacy so it hardly affected the experience for us. The room was clean and I would recommend this for future guests!"

3775876,18201934,2014-08-23,19712554,Frank,"My wife and I planned a 10 day trip to Boston for a small honeymoon and to see family. We were greeted by Oriana to her beautiful apartment in Jamaica Plain. We had a nice room with enough drawer space and closet space for our belongings so settling in was easy. The area is a short nice walk to the Green st T which gave us full access to Boston and down to the suburbs.  All would have appeared to be perfect. .However there is a family situation with the host that caused much tension. My wife and I were forced to relocate to another apartment late in our stay. I will spare the details out of respect for Oriana bc she gave us all she could to make us comfortable and she is a very sweet hardworking individual.  I would say that the circumstances were out of her control however she was the host so the responsibility must fall on somebody. I sincerely wish that things worked out more smoothly and I know that Oriana feels that too. I just feel the responsibility to be honest here bc this is information my wife and I would have liked to know before hand and that would have probably pushed us to another location. I would say in closing to any future travelers who plan on visiting the area, you will not find a better host as a person, however it seems that this family situation is out of her control and until that is resolved  I can not vouch for the stay. I sincerely hope that things get better for Oriana as her heart is in the right place and she is an extremely reliable and caring host."
3775876,19805408,2014-09-18,20283791,Joe,Listing was accurate. Neighborhood was easy to access and made it easy to get around town. Place was clean and quiet. I'd highly recommend this listing to others as a convenient and restful place in JP.

3775876,43207305,2015-08-17,24730897,Evie,"The place was very comfortable and our host made us feel welcome. She and her friend were about to leave for a trip down to Brooklyn and they were frantically trying to manage getting the room ready while getting their own things organized. This turned into one of the funny stories of all time. We met them late in the afternoon after having needed to have our car towed from a radiator leak. So, we arrived at their place in massive style - the the 30ft flatbed truck of Triple A. After dropping our things in the room, and chatting about keys etc, we headed off for our son's music concert around the corner. Later that night, after the gig, we returned to the house to discover that my husband's bag had vanished. Logic departed, since we were now beginning to convince ourselves that we hadn't brought it from the car, I sent a frantic text to our host which she responded to almost immediately (fantastic communication with these folks). Her boyfriend, in their haste, had thought the green suitcase was hers and had packed it. It was now in Brooklyn! We were actually much relieved to find out where it went. She mailed it back the next day - to our home, since we were leaving. All, very responsible and kind efforts on our host's part to take care of their mistake. We did laugh! I would stay here again anytime. Very nice place, and fabulous JP location. Price was fair. I do think the cleaning fee for a less than 24 hour stay is a bit steep though. Not sure who makes that decision."

Fantastic modern Bohemian decorations! The back porch was adorable and cozy.  Ori's dog, Kira, is a sweetie! Couldn't have had a better experience."

12756776,87691717,2016-07-21,81565511,Zhiyi,This is my first AIRBNB trip. This apt is wonderful. Very close to the subway station. Bright living room. Beautiful bedrooms. We enjoyed staying in this apt.
12756776,88465522,2016-07-24,9191583,Audrey,There was a bottle of wine waiting for us. Ilan was very quick to respond.
12756776,92161382,2016-08-07,86510724,Patty,The plusses: The host was very responsive to our inquiries.  He was quick to fix an issue we had. The location is within a 15 min drive to the downtown area.
The negatives:  There is no internet service or cable.  There is no DVD player,and only one small TV in the living room. There is an antenna for local channels which was good.,,,,
There is no parking at the apartment during the day 8:00-5:00 p.m. You must have a residence sticker. There is a street to park that is located 2-3 blocks away but not enough parking spaces for the cars that park there. It was full each day. We ended up with a $40 parking ticket. Very frustrating!,,,,,

Her apartment is spacious and tidy, and the location is 10 minutes walking from the freedom trail center at Fanueil Hall."
The amenities in the building are amazing--a pool,sauna,gym,rec room,parking...the apartment even features a private balcony that we used to watch a pretty cool thunderstorm.,
That being said--the bathroom and kitchen are extremely dated. I was definitely drawn to Airbnb so that I could cook my own food and microwave leftovers,but I had a hard time in this kitchen. Cheese and cracker friendly,room for beer in the fridge,and a working microwave,but that's all.,
Overall,I would love to stay here again with my expectations slightly modified,"the location and the luxury building cannot be beat! Shemesh is an excellent hostess and we really enjoyed our stay in her apartment.\"",,,

The host was so welcoming and really tried hard to make sure we had a smooth check-in. He provided a subway card for our convenience and towels and shampoo, etc. He responded really quickly whenever I had any questions about the apartment. Really great experience overall!"
13669224,92696799,2016-08-09,40346923,Aakash,The apartment was everything we'd hoped for and then some. Host is super accommodating and everything from the bed to the kitchen to the view from the balcony are just perfect. Would definitely stay here again if I come back to Boston.

9346513,70620985,2016-04-19,25717560,Susan,"Daughter and I stayed at Len's place for the Boston Marathon. I was a little nervous about renting from a host who is new and had no reviews, but Len proved to be a great host. He responded promptly to our communications and was ready and waiting for us when we arrived. He had even put some food and drinks in the fridge for us - above and beyond! The apartment is clean, updated, and in a nicely preserved historic building. It isn't large; I'd say it's comfortable for 2 people but might have been tight for more than that.  There is a queen sized bed in a separate bedroom, and a sofa that turns into a single bed when some of the cushions are removed. Overall, it was  great for the two of us."
The location was perfect for our needs. We were close to all the marathon events and also within walking distance of Fenway Park,the public gardens and commons,the Freedom Trail,Quincy Market,"and M.I.T. We even walked to the north end.  There are also \"\"T\"\" (train) stops within a half mile.",
"The only very minor thing that wasn't to our liking was that there was no coffee maker in the apartment. But Len did mention that we could contact him if this was \"\"a problem\"\" (we didn't)",and he provided lots of high quality Starbucks instant coffee.  Beyond that,I have no issues whatsoever with this place. Beautiful apartment,beautiful building,quiet historic neighborhood.  It was a great Boston experience,"far nicer than staying in an expensive chain hotel in the busy marathon finish area.   \""

I recently visited Boston with my girlfriend to go to a Red Sox game at Fenway Park and attend a party in Back Bay. We found this charming one bedroom condo to be just what we wanted and more. The location can't be beat as it is adjacent to the Best of Boston's restaurants and shops on beautiful Newbury St.,walking distance to Fenway,Boston Common and all the sites.,,,
Len was tremendously helpful and had excellent inside tips on where to park and dine. The condo was perfect,on the second floor and proved to be nice and quiet at night. Handsome classic touches with charming fixtures and modern furniture,with all the necessary modern appliances including a huge flat screen TV and anything else one can think of - including a new coffee maker!,,,

The location is perfect - a 10 minute (ish) walk from Newbury street, 15 minute walk to Boston Common and Copley Sq., etc. The place itself was cute, on the small side, but perfect for three of us. The bedroom bed was very hard, so be prepared, but the house was immaculate, quiet and very well-cared for. I am particularly sensitive to noise from neighbors and/or traffic, and the A/C unit was loud enough to cover most of that up with \"\"white noise\"\". Two thumbs up from me!

Walking distance to so many restaurants, shops, Fenway, etc.  Super quiet building in a wonderful neighborhood.   We were able to relax and unwind without the craziness of staying in a hotel.

The bedroom was super clean, they provided clean towels and sheets, a safe in the closet for our valuables, coffee/water/snacks for us, and even a ride back to the airport!

1544702,8178611,2013-10-19,9294551,Kenneth,"Enjoyed very much. Warning don't pick a third floor room if you don't like steps. The first two floors have 12 foot ceilings. It like going to the fourth floor in most places. Otherwise it was great. The two nice bathrooms on third floor are shared. They are new and  good size. The house is old. I believe I was told 160 years. It has the original wide board floors, old woodwork and ten foot high doors. The Carney family and the house is what makes this an  interesting place to stay. We found getting around Boston on the transit system easy, It about a ten minute walk. If we return to Boston we would hope to stay with the Carneys. We would request the first floor as we are in our mid 70's. If I was 20 years younger I would ask for the third floor."

The room was amazing and clean, the family is warm and kind, and the city itself is a delight to visit. I would recommend staying at the Carneys' to ANYONE. You won't regret it: the metro is really close by (10 mins walking), the rooms are clean and beautiful, there is always food in the fridge and listening to John and Robert play just makes the experience more unbelievable. Thank you so much, Carney family!"

The Carney family (Barney, Mary and their son Robert) were welcoming, warm and kind people and their big charming house is a short stroll from the T station.  My room was cozy and spacious and the coffee and muffins they served every morning were delicious.  I went to Boston hoping to watch a World Series game. The reason I can call this trip perfect is not only because I scored a face value ticket for game 6 but also because of my delightful stay with the Carneys!!  They are very considerate and always made sure I was comfortable and felt at home.  I recommend their house to anyone and hope to see them again, next time with my husband. :)"

The Carney's were great hosts. Clean linens, bathrobes, and a light breakfast served in the hallway just outside the rooms.

Barney helped us make the most of our time in Boston by suggesting places to visit nearby and in Cambridge, as well as a restaurant nearby that turned out to be the best Indian food that I have ever had in my life.

The hosts are very accommodating and great to chat with, and I felt free to come and go without being obligated to hang out.  The back porch provided a nice space where I sat and did some knitting  while I did a load of Laundry.  Wireless internet access cemented the experience, as I was able to connect up with my husband on the west coast....missing him, but able to see him on my device! Had I known how easy it was to get around town by transit I would NOT have rented a car.   Waste of money.  I will be happy to return.   Thank you Mary and all of the Carney family!"
1544702,13229633,2014-05-22,9416261,Andrew,"Barney and Mary Carney have a beautiful Victorian family home, on three floors,  overlooking the water.  My room was spacious and quiet, and the bed very comfortable.The shared bathrooms (I had a choice!) felt perfectly private. Fruit, muffins and cereal were available at all times, and coffee materialized by magic in the early moring on the landing outside the room. The welcome was warm and I would love to have stayed longer."
1544702,13342695,2014-05-26,12429893,Ewelina,"We spent 4 nights in this huge and beautiful house. Carney family is very friendly and answered all our questions about Boston. The location is great, the rooms/bathrooms are very spacious and clean and breakfast delicious. We have a  very pleasant stay. Thank you!"
1544702,13667394,2014-06-02,1714827,Kate,"My fiance and I had a wonderful stay in the Carney house!  Our room was large and private with a pretty view of the bay outside our window.  The house is in a lovely neighborhood.  The Carney's had fresh-brewed coffee, homemade muffins, individual orange juices and milks, yogurt and a wide variety of cereals at our disposal for breakfast every morning.  If we to ever come back to Boston we would definitely stay at the gorgeous Carney house again!"
1544702,13734366,2014-06-03,12429893,Ewelina,"Thank you Mary and Barney one more time, your b'n'b was a very comfortable place to stay."
1544702,13834159,2014-06-05,5754308,Emilie,"The room was perfect, in a really nice house with a lot of charm. The neighborhood was calm. 10 minutes to T, and then 15 minutes to downtown. The hosts were really considerate, providing us with breakfast, bathrobes, bath products, etc. We loved our stay at Carney's family and we recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Boston!"
1544702,14112896,2014-06-12,12459132,Tiana,"My mom and I stayed with the Carney family for 7 days while looking for an apartment in Boston. Not only was the room immaculate, but we could not have asked for better hosts. Disregard anything you've heard about Dorchester if you are staying here. The area is beautiful and we felt completely safe throughout our stay commuting to the T. Both Mary and Barney are the sweetest people. Barney helped my mom map a running route in the mornings, made muffins, and shared stories with us about his beautiful, talented children. Mary was still awake when we returned late one night with baked goods from the North End and she gave us coffee to accompany our treats. I plan to try booking with them anytime my family visits me in Boston in the future."
1544702,14189164,2014-06-14,6398051,Thomas,We had a wonderful stay at the Carney family's house. Mary and Barney are great hosts and they provided us with great information about the area and the possibilities of sightseeing. The communication before the stay was perfect. We received detailed information. Our room and the bathroom were very clean. The location of the house is perfect with the metro station near by. I definitely recommend the Carney familiy to other airbnb travelers!
1544702,14254191,2014-06-15,4941630,Gaetan,"The house is really nice and the hosts very welcoming! We had a really good time there, thank you!"
1544702,14556060,2014-06-22,14223578,Marco,"Carney home assolutamente consigliata. Se volete vivere l'esperienza di provare una vera casa Bostoniana questo  e' il posto giusto. La casa si trova vicino alla baia, in un tranquillo quartiere di Boston con la metropolitana a meno di dieci minuti a piedi. Barney e la sua famiglia sono stati ospitali e sempre pronti a dare suggerimenti e consigli sulle cose da vedere in Boston. La camera in cui siamo stati alloggiati era spaziosa e i bagni veramente in ottimo stato. A chi piace un ottimo caffè lungo e muffin fatti in casa."
1544702,14633949,2014-06-23,16112092,Kainan,"I'm so lucky, Barney and Mary accepted my application very soon even I'm a green hand in AirBnB without any reviews and even don't know need to do profile verify. Savin Hill is only 20mins away from Boston, green line can get to, it's peaceful area with very nice persons. Barney's home is cozy,clean,very comfortable bed, big bathrooms. Have a chance to meet Barney face to face, very kindly gentleman! Highly recommended to living here!"
1544702,14971573,2014-06-30,15694672,Allen,Living with the Carney Family was an absolute delight! They have a beautiful home and was very welcoming in every way possible.
1544702,15091922,2014-07-02,5277678,Linda,"This is a delightful place for a visit to Boston.  The large house is within walking distance of the red line, a short walk to the water, and within walking distance of the JFK library.  Mary and Barry are warm and friendly and have a number of welcoming touches.  They've redone the third floor bedrooms and baths, and they are lovely.  Not that it is a long walk up to the 3rd floor, though.  They also have three rooms on the first floor."
1544702,15163305,2014-07-03,230261,Jaira,"It has been said that the details are everything and the Carney Family hits all the right notes! The lovely home is in a convenient location near a nice little beach area for walking and reflection. The place is just a short walk from the metro station. It feels like a home away from home. The only regrets I have about the Carney Family home are that 1) I didn't meet the lovely people who were so communicative, warm and inviting for my arrival and 2) I didn't stay longer. This place ranks among the top spots on my list for AirBnB experiences. I can't wait to book again!"
1544702,15236747,2014-07-05,16972416,Conely,"My best friend, Karen, and I had a lovely stay. Our room was clean, bright and comfortable. Mary was an excellent host and Barney's homemade muffins and freshly brewed coffee made for a wonderful start to our day. Thank you, Carney Family!"
1544702,15409532,2014-07-08,5883261,Sarah,"We only stayed with the Carney family for a short time, but the room was very nice. They set it up in the king bed for us. Barney was very helpful in directing us with the train, good places to eat, and fun things to do. Very accommodating! Thank you!"
1544702,15574668,2014-07-12,14906434,Anick,It was a nice experience for our first AIRNB
1544702,16883133,2014-08-04,6121867,Kate,"This was a really unique and amazing experience.  Mary and Barney always went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating, not only to me but to all their guests. I stayed with two other colleagues for three weeks in Mary's Ocean View, and during that time I was surprised that I didn't have to wait for a bathroom, the laundry room, or for the use of the stove in the common kitchen, and I was always able to find a place for a moment of quiet.  I met many different people from all over the world which made for some very interesting conversations.  The fresh muffins that are provided every morning along with all the other wonderful breakfast options are delicious, as well as filling and quiet the variety."
The Kitchen:  enough space in the fridge for personal groceries,was provided labels to put on all food,was given a shelf in a cabinet for non-perishable items,use of all dish ware and cooking utensils,dirty dishes could be placed directly into the dish washer and were washed on the daily by the Carney family,there is also a second smaller fridge on the top floor which made it convenient to keep a few items in for easy and quick access.
Laundry:  even though I brought my own laundry soap and fabric sheets it looked like the Carney family provided those supplies for their guests,never had to wait long.,,,,
Bathrooms:  there are two on the top floor both fully equipped,shampoo and soap were provided,beautiful views from both bathrooms,plenty of natural light filtering in,both very clean and everything was constantly replenished and available from TP to tissues,towels
Bedrooms:  Our room was great,slept three very comfortably and still managed to give each of us our own space,there was a night stand for every bed,great natural lighting,very warm and inviting room,you can see the ocean from one of the windows
Neighborhood:  a quick 8-10 min walk to the T (train station),beautiful street with unique houses,felt very safe walking late at night,very friendly neighbors,cars tended to go a little fast for a residential neighborhood so walk with caution across the streets.  There is plenty of little stores and food options off of the T stop.  The beach is truly right down the hill of their backyard and it is a beautiful area to sit and relax,never found it crowded
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in a very clean,warm,and inviting bed and breakfast (that is truly what it feels like),"where you are taken care of and yet given your space.  Mary and Barney are incredible people with a beautiful home.  This was nothing short of wonderful and I look forward to staying next summer. \"",,

Barney help us to find our road back home. Really close to the train. He gave us good info where to go. Going back to Boston, I'll go back there."
1544702,17363745,2014-08-11,4014434,Todd,"The Carney Family has a beautiful home, offer fresh muffins and coffee in the morning and made us feel like family friends in for a visit. The room was large and bright and the bed was comfy. The house is a short walk to the red line T, which basically connects you to the major sights in Boston. We loved our stay!"
1544702,18099510,2014-08-21,9318628,Holly,"I loved this place so much! This was the most warm hearted and professional air bnb I have stayed. Barney and Andrea are very easy going and generous. The home is beautiful and close to the waterfront as well as the metro station. They provide delicious coffee, yogurt, fruit, cereals and muffins which were a nice treat. They have maids who clean regularly so everything is spotless. I only wish I could've stayed longer."
1544702,18525160,2014-08-28,13145701,Jessica,"The Carney family had a beautiful house, and we felt right at home as soon as we arrived. The neighbourhood is very safe and is ideally situated next to the beach but close to the t train. It was real bonus getting muffins and orange juice for breakfast and the carney family were always on hand to solve any problems or answer any questions."
If we go back to Boston we would stay here again,"thank you!\"",,,,

The two-bed room was comfy,clean and really nice! The view out of the window with sunrise above the harbour was every day breathtaking!!,,,,
The beach and the subway are really good to reach.,,,,,

1544702,19113977,2014-09-06,14296478,Elizabeth,"Our host did a great job, especially considering it was a last-minute reservation. The accommodations were great-very well-suited to having guests. It was a great neighborhood-lovely old houses and I felt safe leaving my car on the street. The closest T stop-Savin Hill-is a quick walk."
1544702,19190652,2014-09-08,16165203,Judith,"Het huis oogde nogal rommelig. Er was nauwelijks spaken van interactie met de eigenaren, wij vonden dat jammer. Ontbijten op een bankje in een halletje of op je bed, ronduit slecht! Heerlijke douches, goed sanitair. Dicht bij het centrum, wij zouden niet opnieuw voor dit adres opnieuw kiezen en of aanbevelen."
1544702,19293532,2014-09-09,16453323,Renata,"The room was very clean, the house  is very close to down town,bus station and airport. The host gave us very clear directions how to find their house so it was very easy. We really enjoyed our staying with Carney family."
1544702,19508864,2014-09-14,813140,Juergen,We had a very good sleep at the CarneyFamily's house. The room and bathrooms were very clean and comfortable. A good pleace to stay if you want to explore Boston.

1544702,20275790,2014-09-27,15939624,Erin,"Our stay at the Carney's was awesome!!  My mom and I loved it.  As others have mentioned, Mary gave us very clear and helpful instructions of how to get to their place from the airport and then on how to access our room.  We had a very sweet room upstairs and enjoyed the other travelers staying up on the third floor as well.  Their place felt like home for the week we were there.  Everything, including the bathrooms, was clean and well kept.  As others have also mentioned the fresh, home baked muffins every morning were such a treat!  We even heard their son playing excellent music on their second floor piano one evening - which was also a treat!  I think the only little thing that might be challenging for some was staying in the room right next to the breakfast nook meant that sleeping in (past 7 am) was not really an option.  I'm not sure that would really matter to most travelers.  I would definitely stay there again!!"
1544702,20366417,2014-09-28,16961250,Christian,"My wife and I spent here just few hours, but we felt like home. Room was awesome, neighborhood was very quiet and nice. Also check in and check out was very easy. We got perfect directions for parking and a restaurant from Barney and of course, I had his awesome Muffins for breakfast."

1544702,21654458,2014-10-21,19328913,Lynn,"What a warm and welcoming home! Staying with the Carneys is like staying with dear friends. They have a beautiful home on the water in a very cute neighborhood. It's walking distance to the metro and the accommodations offer so many thoughtful touches--extra blankets and pillows, robes and slippers, and breakfast treats such as yogurt with Mary's homemade granola, Barneys muffins, fruit, juice, and coffee every morning. The other airbnb visitors to the house were terrific, too.  Its such a fun place to be! You'll love it!"

However, we knew as soon as we arrived that we would be very happy in Mary & Barney's home.  By chance they both greeted us at the door and we were shown to our lovely \"\"Mary's Ocean View\"\" room.  The breakfast table (just outside our bedroom) was well stocked each morning with fresh coffee and Barney's freshly made muffins"

1544702,22302530,2014-11-03,21468638,Dalton,Mary and Barney were absolutely amazing hosts. They made our stay in Boston much more enjoyable. Full recommendations.

1544702,22463688,2014-11-07,22535867,Yasuhiro,とてもいいところでした!部屋はおしゃれでシャワー室、トイレもきれいで非常に落ち着きました。部屋に入ると水がおいてあり、旅人への気遣いが感じられました。朝には出来立てのマフィンが部屋の前においてあり最高でした。ホストのBarneyはなんでも相談に乗ってくれる暖かい人でした。是非おすすめします。
1544702,22529668,2014-11-09,21537432,Asako,"Carney family was a great host! We just stayed only two night and we couldn't have few chances to talk to them. However, they made muffins for breakfast and provided coffee and tea. The room which we stayed was amazing. They set a variety of towels, water, and bathrobe. We definitely spent great nights in their house. We even wish we could stay longer."

They have wifi, slippers, robes, local guide and standard toiletries. Enjoyed the complimentary breakfast. I left my charger and they were kind enough to offer to send it."
"Very satisfied !\"",,,,,

1544702,23803602,2014-12-10,19482406,Matt,"We stayed five nights at the Carney house, and we couldn't have been happier.  The house is large and expansive, but not cold, even in the middle of December.  It was very easy access getting to and from our room, even though it was on the top floor of the house.  The views out the window were nice, and the beds were comfortable.  And Barney's muffins were tasty, as was Mary's granola, and there was some tasty homemade jam in the fridge, as well."
The best part about it for me was the dedicated guest-use kitchen on the first floor.  I wound up cooking three full meals.  My goal was to leave it cleaner than I found it because I appreciated the use of it so much.  My daughter and friend (and me as well) loved the bathroom set up.  There are very nice two full bathrooms situated right next to each other,with great hot water and gigantic tubs.,,,,
Another great part of our stay in the Carney house was the piano.  Mary's son would play in the evening,along with other guests playing from time to time.  Mary and Barney were both very helpful and accommodating,and never invasive to our personal space.  The house is 100% smoke free and smelled fresh and clean,and sometimes smelled of a tasty dinner Mary was cooking.  Plus the T and Dorchester business area is a quick walk away.,,
"It was a great stay and I highly recommend staying at the Carney Family house.\"",,,,,
1544702,27638671,2015-03-09,23990085,Andrew,"This was our fist AirBnB experience and it was a great way to start! The house was beautifully maintained and had lots of charm.  Barney's morning muffins, coffee, and other breakfast items were a great way to start the day. Both Mary and Barney were pleasant to be around when we did see them, but for the most part let us have our own time. Pushing the beds together to make the king sized bed was a little awkward since the frames created a gap in the middle, but we made due shifting the mattresses around a bit. Overall the experience was fantastic and would definitely return for another stay!"

1544702,32764583,2015-05-21,24014593,Emily,"This was a great place to stay for my mom and myself.  My mom had never stayed in an airbnb and she thought it was absolutely delightful (she keeps talking about it!).  The house is beautiful and comfortable with great views.  Loved the little nook just outside our room with the homemade muffins, yogurt and granola. Appreciated the willingness of family members to help us out when we had questions.  The listing was accurate and the neighborhood was lovely.  I'd like to stay again in the future if I'm in Boston."
1544702,32836254,2015-05-22,31872469,Stefania,"My husband and I stayed with Carney family for one night during our first time visiting Boston and we loved it. The house is located in a very nice neighborhood and in walking distance from a metro station, which makes the transit to the downtown very easy. The room and the bathrooms were very clean and nice with views to the harbor (……including the bathroom). We had access to the kitchen and the porch but we had no time to use it. We enjoyed the fresh muffins and coffee that were available for us just near the bedroom. Mary got in touch with us in few hours from the time we made the booking and sent us lots of useful information. We loved the place and we will for sure return here."
1544702,33498672,2015-05-29,4957782,Birgit,"We had a really great stay at Mary's and Barney's house in Boston! Everything was simply perfect: The exact route description before our arrival, the room (there were even bathrobes and slippers!!), Barney's muffins and Mary's granola...."
The room and the (shared) bathroom were meticulously clean - in the bathroom there was showergel and body milk waiting for the guests - this house is definitely better than any hotel!! :),,,,,
We thouroughly enjoyed our time and strongly recommend a stay at Carney family to everybody planning a trip to Boston!,,,,,
"We definitely recommend this \"",,,,,
1544702,33820625,2015-06-01,8696040,Deborah,"Our hosts sent very detailed instructions on hoe to get to their home and how to find our room if no one was home. Their son was home and showed us to our room. The house is a large, older, three story home that had formerly been split into several units. The first floor and third floor are the guest area, while the second floor is where the family lives. They rent seven or eight rooms and we had the opportunity to meet people from four countries."
Fresh muffins,homemade granola,yogurt and coffee/tea were provided,but unfortunately,neither of us could eat those foods. Fortunately,there were ample facilities to make our own food.
Our hosts were helpful,but unobtrusive.  For us,we would have liked a bit more interaction with our hosts,since that is one of reasons we choose BnBs over hotels. But if you want a nice place to stay at a reasonable rate,this is a good place to choose.,
The location is great. There is ample parking if you drive and it is a reasonably short walk to the train which is only three or four stops from the city.,,,,,
"Good place to stay.\"",,,,,
1544702,34013233,2015-06-03,32088341,Jill,"the house is very beautiful and clean,and prepared good breakfast too,"
"it gave us good rest in this trip.\"",,,,,
1544702,34128859,2015-06-05,12907465,Yachao,"This room was booked for two of my family friends who travelled with us in Boston. They really enjoyed their stay both in the house and in this great city. The host, Mary and Barney,  made them fell very comfortable and relax. Thank Carney family very much again for their perfect hospitality."
1544702,34525543,2015-06-09,29293490,Martha,"The Carneys gave thorough directions and instructions prior to our arrival, and their home was easy to find, not far off the main route to downtown Boston.  We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood, birds singing in the trees. Our room very clean, with comfortable beds.  We enjoyed our stay!"
1544702,34949601,2015-06-14,30520131,如恩,"A great place to stay, I felt cozy and warm here. Highly recommended!"
1544702,35268413,2015-06-16,12096536,Marie,"As always, a welcoming place to stay. First time in this room. Great space. Comfortable and quiet."
Although there are two bathrooms that get shared,I have never had to wait or felt like it was a shared space.,,,,
"My go to place in Boston.\"",,,,,
1544702,35800028,2015-06-22,32366130,Alex,"Staying with the Carney family was great! The house and neighborhood were both very pleasant. I slept with the windows open, enjoying a cool summer breeze, and woke up to a beautiful view of the sun rising over the bay. Although it was a BnB, it felt as luxurious as a hotel. The room had a fresh carafe of water waiting for me which was a great welcome, the little things go a long way! In the morning I took advantage of the comfy bathrobe and slippers waiting for me in the wardrobe."
The hosts were also very accommodating when it turned out that I had to leave earlier than expected. Although I offered to pay for the missed days because of the short notice,Barney promised me that he would update the reservation so that I could get as much of a refund as Air BnB would allow.,,,,
Can't wait until the next time I'm in Boston so I can stay here again,"my only regret is that I couldn't have stayed longer!\"",,,,
1544702,36263080,2015-06-27,11197574,John,"My daughter and I enjoyed staying in the Carney Family home, the house is huge, the neighbourhood is quiet and the subway (the T) is a short walk away. The room was spacious and cosy with an ocean view, as described. The bathrooms were rather wonderful, having been recently refurbished. Breakfast was fine, with excellent breakfast tea (hooray!), though a wee bit more fruit would have been welcome. Overall, very good value and a great location for a visit to Boston."
1544702,36771446,2015-07-01,27104347,Shirley,"The Carneys sent directions for self-check-in which made it easy to find our room. Even though we didn't meet them first day, the next day when we talked I found Mary and Barney friendly and fascinating. They were great hosts, helping us when we needed help. Beyond helping us, they loaned us an Einstein book upon learning of my granddaughter's interest in math and physics."
1544702,37543679,2015-07-08,21313116,Tatjana,"The room was nice and looked just like on the picture. We didn't met Mary often but when we met her she was always super nice to us. They served fresh muffins, milk and orange juice every morning. The bathroom was always clean. All in all we had a great time at Mary's and would definitely come back when we're in Boston again!"
1544702,37720376,2015-07-09,5595564,Amy,Wonderful stay! Barney was very helpful and we were very well catered for. Beautiful house and facilities and a handy location to the city. Highly recommend!
1544702,37773776,2015-07-10,9424228,Kristoffer,We had a quick night here with a late check-in and an early check-out. The place was in top condition and I would happily recommend anyone staying here.
1544702,37902864,2015-07-11,30741215,Samantha,"I had a short but lovely stay with Mary and Barney. The room was just what I needed, and the house was spotless, charming and had everything you'd need. Even though there were a few other guests staying in the house, you wouldn't know it - it was very quiet and peaceful. It's about a 10 minute walk to the T station which was very convenient, and I loved being able to run along the waterfront which was a short jump away. I didn't have much time to explore the neighbourhood but it felt very safe. Wish I'd been able to stay longer - and enjoy another muffin, delicious! Thanks for the great stay, I look forward to staying with you again the next time I come to Boston!"
1544702,39282720,2015-07-22,33863184,Keoni,"Coming from California, this was a great location, with great people, great accommodations, and great muffins! We hope to be back!"
1544702,39629053,2015-07-25,21495349,Bernadette,"It was a nice stay in Boston. At Carneys Family it was like living in a big family. Everbody had his/her room, bath all together. The little breakfast every morning was good."
1544702,40092690,2015-07-28,32018071,Masako,Everything was parfect about their house. I felt as if we was staying in a traditional hotel with wanderful conveniences.
The family was very friendly and environment was so nice.,,,,,
We would not be more satisfied!,,,,,
"We'd love to stay with them again.\"",,,,,
1544702,40574701,2015-08-01,26642704,Angelika,Staying with Mary and Barney was very relaxing for us. The whole house is so comfortable and we felt at home there. The breakfast with Mary's granola startet our days deliciously and playing the piano was a treat.
The neighborhood is quiet and has beautiful old houses,around the train station are some nice places for dining.,,,,
When we needed something,Barney and Mary immediately helped us.,,,,
If we visit Boston again,"we would definitely stay at their house again.\"",,,,
1544702,41189162,2015-08-05,26903127,Jim,"Fantastic room in a great location on the outskirts of Boston.  It is a $12 Uber ride to the centre of Boston and Barney and Mary were fantastic hosts, who had quite literary thought of everything"
1544702,42110666,2015-08-11,29693144,Ana Cristina,It was a very nice experience to stay by CarneyFamily. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. We would stay again!!  Thank you!

Although we didn't interact with them much, it was clear they'd be available to help if we needed them. The room and facilities were as described and exceeded our expectations. Although there were several other guests in the house, it was a very quiet atmosphere which we were happy about. We were very pleased with the location of the house as well. It was a quick walk to the T station & with a 7 day pass costing only 19 dollars, you can't beat it! Perfect location if you want to be a in quiet area close enough to hop on the T and be in Boston within an hour. I would definitely consider staying with the Carney Family again!"
1544702,43775162,2015-08-22,4633454,Susan,"Highly recommend this host and house.  From start to finish the communication was excellent, the home was fantastic and very generous hospitality that included breakfast.  We would stay here again if/when we visit Boston again."
1544702,43985280,2015-08-23,16956674,Jessica,"\"Barney and the Carney Family were extremely helpful and excellent hosts. Before arriving in Boston Barney contacted us and made sure we knew where to park and gave us very detailed directions on how to get to the house. Once in Boston, Barney gave us a fabulous recommendation for a restaurant to get dinner at. The room was even better in person than in the pictures and the bathrooms are very spacious. My 6'5\"\" boyfriend said it was the first B and B shower he didn't have to stoop to wash his hair in haha! Overall"
1544702,44293360,2015-08-25,33365603,Fiona,"An absolutely fantastic place to stay! The house is beautiful , and the directions that Barney gave were brilliant. A very convenient place to stay  to get into the city and also very easy to get to the airport- so glad to have chosen to stay there!"
1544702,45361420,2015-09-02,23524957,Elisabeth,Dette var vårt første gang vi  brukte airbnb og må si vi ble  positivt overasket.Verten var veldig hyggelig og viste oss rundt i huset.Alt stemte i forhold til beskivelse på siden. Rommet var rent og ryddig.Frokost muffisen var nydelige.  Nabolaget var rolig og koseligt .
1544702,45500971,2015-09-03,31367192,Claire,"We loved everything about the Carney Family and their B and B.  The room was great - they had set it up as a king bed with the two twins joined and it made the room open and spacious.  We met Barney on the day of arrival and Mary on the day of departure although Mary was available via phone right away when we had a question about the AC upon arrival.  We ordered take out from the Indian restaurant in the neighborhood because it was a broiling hot day and we just chilled at the B and B and relaxed after our long ride down from Vermont.  The rooms were spotless, the bathrooms beautiful!  Did not hear any noise from adjacent rooms and thankfully the AC kept us comfortable all night long.  We enjoyed a great walk through the neighborhood in the morning and loved the whole feel of the area.  Wonderful experience and we will definitely return again.  Thank you Barney and Mary!"
1544702,45660879,2015-09-05,7780583,Mathilde,Very nice room in boston!

1544702,46621291,2015-09-12,38563384,Andreas,"A very great place to spend his vacation. Toll and lovingly decorated, we were unfortunately only one night. Almost like a hotel from the equipment, for sale should, you ought to forgive 6 star."

We were warmly welcomed by the owner and given great advice on dinner places - just down the street - and then a nice tour of the house, our room, the TWO bathrooms, and the set-up for morning coffee,tea,danish, etc., which we weren't expecting.   So nice.   Then, had a nice visit with Mary, who gave us a tip for visiting the U of Mass campus, nearby and the Museum.   Room was very comfortable, nice decorating.   All was first rate, including the bathrooms, which were very up-to-date, clean and bright."
1544702,49791949,2015-10-06,42418655,Brian,"This was a beautiful house in a very scenic location. The house was very large and accommodated many rooms with other visitors. My room was clean and comfortable and well maintained, and the hosts left amenities on each floor for the guests, which was very nice. The hosts were helpful and welcoming and I really enjoyed my stay."
1544702,49931147,2015-10-07,41236639,Erin,"We stayed here on the last night of our trip. It was a great compromise between proximity to Boston and price. The room was large and the beds were comfortable though a little squeaky. There were two nicely updated bathrooms on our floor that were shared with other guests and a small sitting area with a mini fridge, microwave, teas, etc. Our host even had freshly baked muffins set out in the morning. The convenience of the sitting area was wonderful being on the third floor!"
1544702,50008453,2015-10-08,37385864,Birgit,"We only stayed one night and were perfectly satisfied. The room we stayed in was beautiful and spacious (as was the entire part of the house available to guests), and the breakfast was very good. The two single beds can be moved and put next to each other to form a double bed. Especially the bathroom was beautiful and included a very large shower. There is nothing at all that I could think of that can be improved, it seemed like the hosts thought of everything their guests could possibly need!"

The room is exactly as shown on the picture. The house is awesome,very close to the see by a little path in the garden. Morning Muffins are more than fine.,,,,
Just to notice that if you haven't a car,"there's nothing nearby for diner or lunch.\"",,,,
1544702,50424256,2015-10-12,1585449,Mandy,Would stay here again! What you see is what you get. Pics and description are accurate. Hosts respond within minutes to emails which is awesome. Hosts friendly and love Barneys home made freshly baked muffins! Its easy access from Downtown and the airport. It is beautifully clean and I especially liked the sensor lights to the bathrooms. Do yourself a favour....you wont be disappointed!
1544702,50830363,2015-10-15,33506826,Clément,The apartment is really nice. I stayed there for a few nights with my parents. It is really clean and we had bathrobes given for the duration of our stay. It looks like you are in a hotel. Even breakfast is included. Even though you stay in one of their room you feel really at ease and cumfortable.
It is well located as it is 10 min walk away from subway station. Then taking the subway will take you to downtown in 15 min.,,,,,
Be aware that if you are three in the Mary's view on the ocean room,you will have three twin beds. When we looked at the pictures we fought there were two beds: a queen bed and a twin bed.,,,,
"Apart from that the only regret we can have is not having met Barney and Mary.\"",,,,,

1544702,51687289,2015-10-24,28063122,Silvia,"Das Zimmer war wirklich klasse und so wie auf dem Bild. Wunderbare Aussicht auf das Meer bzw. den kleinen Hafen dahinter. Auf dem gleichen Flur zwei Bäder, die einfach top waren - modern und vor allen Dingen picobello sauber. Ganz süß und praktisch die kleine Ecke auf dem Flur, wo man sich Kaffee, Tee, Toast bereiten konnte (was wir auch genutzt haben). Dazu standen immer Muffins bereit, Äpfel, Birnen, Joghurt und Cerialien sowie Orangensaft. Wir hätten auch die Gemeinschaftsküche im 1. Stock nutzen können, aber so war es besser und wir haben im Bett gefrühstückt. - Wunderbar. - Das Haus liegt in einer wunderbar ruhigen Gegend und durch den Garten runter ist man gleich an einer Promenade am Meer - auch absolut beschaulich dort. Nur 10 Minuten zur Metro, das schafft man auch gut mit 2 schweren Koffern. Im Zimmer gab es Pantoffeln, Bademäntel, Handtücher - da ist an jede Kleinigkeit gedacht worden. Die Matratzen super bequem. Wir haben uns von der ersten Minute an echt wohl gefühlt und bedanken uns ganz herzlich bei Carney Familiy."
1544702,52394811,2015-10-29,4776841,Angie,"Mary and Barney made us feel most welcome throughout our stay, and helped us with all of our queries with their excellent local knowledge. Ideal hosts, we would stay again."

The house is beautiful, and Mary and Barney really have thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and easy from beginning to end, including a delicious breakfast muffin in the morning! The house is also a close walk to UMB which is great. I'd definitely stay again."
1544702,52834619,2015-11-02,39177793,Claudia,"Barney sent out very clear directions on how to get to their place, plus directions on how to get in the house and to the room my friend and I were staying in. The house is absolutely beautiful and the pictures do not do it justice. The room is very cozy and very, very clean. The bathrooms that are located on the same floor as the room are very modern and very clean. Barney and Mary have thought of everything prior to your arrival. The morning muffins, granola, yogurt, OJ, coffee, fruit, and tea are perfect and delicious. The walk to the metro is very pleasant and seems like a very safe neighborhood. The location of the house is great! If I ever visit Boston again, I will definitely try and stay here again!"

1544702,55457443,2015-12-01,34071144,Zheng,We had a wonderful stay at the Carney's house. The whole house is so lovely and when we first got there we followed the instructions Mary gave us. And it was like an exploration to find our lovely room. The muffin Mary made was so delicious and we really enjoyed the talk with Barney and he showed us the songs his kids made. The whole house is decorated by the paintings the family made and all the furnitures are carefully placed. We will definitely choose Carney's the next time we visit Boston.

1544702,56720742,2015-12-17,46603080,Jennifer,"The Carneys were a great family to stay with. Though we didn't interact all that much, the space they provided for their guests was beyond expectations (i.e. breakfast items, bathroom amenities, first floor living room and kitchen, just to name a few). Mary's Ocean View was a great first Airbnb experience and I would love to come back in the future."
1544702,57042878,2015-12-21,47278992,Damon,This house is amazing and a short walk to the red line. Our host were very accommodating and Barney made muffins from scratch every morning. Great place to stay when in the Boston area.

1544702,58957256,2016-01-05,46482986,Lance,"This was my second stay and I love this home.  Beautiful old victorian in nice neighborhood.  Convenient walk to the red line (unless you have a lot of luggage).  Room was in excellent condition, very clean, high-quality linens and bedding.  The room has no desk but I enjoyed working with my laptop on the couch in the common area (where I also had a nice chat with Mary Carney and I consumed the one remaining of Barney's muffins :-).  Very quiet house and neighborhood, with the exception that someone below had their TV on very loud around 1:30 am, but thankfully that only lasted a short while.  Restrooms are shared but clean and I've never had to wait.  The Carney's are pros, this home is an excellent value and well-worth the trip to Dorchester."
1544702,59659727,2016-01-13,52877844,Brian,I enjoyed my stay with the Carney Family very much!  It was very cozy and the muffins were delicious!  It had everything you need for a comfortable nights rest and I wish I could've stayed longer!

They provide lots of small cute specials that are not expected, like all day fresh fruit as well as coffee and tea. Me and my daughter liked the bathrobes with slippers the most! Every morning there were also home made muffins. There is also a lot of parking space and the subway into the city is in walking distance, which makes it easy to explore Boston. The whole stay we felt like part of the CarneyFamily and would recommend this place a lot."

1544702,66655288,2016-03-23,46482986,Lance,"My son and I stay at the Carneys occasionally when traveling to Boston on business so their place is starting to feel like home-away-from-home.  This time I took full advantage of their food supply, so I'll describe that - orange juice (not from concentrate), variety of teas and coffees, several different kinds of freshly made muffins and they were fantastic!  There is also homemade granola and organic yogurt.  Fresh apples (yes I ate all this stuff :-)  Sometimes they have a bowl of chocolates around.  Anyhow, you get the idea - you won't go hungry here :-)"

My daughter and I planned an unexpected trip to Boston on a fairly short notice.  We live in Alaska so planning a trip only a few weeks out usually makes if difficult to find accommodations.  We were so lucky to find this place. The accommodations were so comfortable, clean, and tasty too!  We stayed in Mary's Ocean View room and it was a special treat! The 2 shared bathrooms close to the room were large, fresh and clean and had a view too!  What a great surprise to find robes and slippers in our closet! The neighborhood was great! We passed a neighbor on the sidewalk on our first day as we were \"\"dragging our bags\"\" and they asked if we were looking for 231 and said we were almost there and pointed to the yellow house. Mary and Barney are great hosts and very helpful in not only making us feel comfortable and at home"
1544702,70869393,2016-04-21,9924951,Jenny,"Wonderfully clear directions for self check in to this awesome traditional Boston Victorian home. A very comfortable space- I felt very at home here - childhood memories of a similar large old home that I grew up in with its lovely tall ceilings, polished balustrades up to the top floor. And the self serve breakfasts were great. Fresh fruit, tea/coffee, homemade Granola and yoghurt and the homemade muffins of course! Great job Carneys! Very enjoyable stay!"

Both bathrooms are very new and very clean,which scored high with me!,,,,
The hosts have coffee & tea making upstairs,plus a small fridge with complimentary orange juice and yoghurt. Home made granola and muffins complete this very warm welcome.,,,,

1544702,77542848,2016-06-01,35854826,Liz,It was good. They provided breakfast. And everything was clean and cozy.

We loved the neighborhood and architecture of the homes. Being from Hawaii we don't see homes like theirs often. Therefore,we took the opportunity to take pictures...of everything!,,,,
Barney was very communicative. He responded to my emails promptly and was very detailed. We bumped into him when we returned from venturing around the Boston area,with our dinner and he showed us to the kitchen/dining area on the first floor. In that brief exchange,I could tell he was a very warm and welcoming person.,,,
"I have already recommended this listing to my friends on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN). Thank you for allowing us to be guests in your home. Aloha!\"",,,,,

The room is wonderful and clean with a small ocean view. I was surprised that he even offered us muffins in the next morning, and we can have the yogurt, orange juice, etc. The bathrooms are outside the bedroom but they are perfectly maintained. I even got to play the piano a little bit. (I really love the fact he allowed the guests to play the piano.) In a word, the experience was amazing. I'll still book their room next time I visit Boston."

Greeted us and showed us our room which I originally booked for 3 but ended up bringing another family and accommodated all 4 of us in the Mary's Ocean View room with such a short notice. Instructions were clear and concise. Residential location, quiet and walking distance to restaurants. The early morning freshly baked muffins were delicious and can smell it while it's being baked PLUS Mary's homemade granola along with yogurt was just the kind of breakfast we need prior to our planned activity. Will come back for sure."

Though we didn't get to meet the hosts, everything in our room was perfect. They provided robes and slippers, plus the sitting area right outside of our room had fruits, muffins, and drinks. The house is beautiful and it's only about 15 minutes away from the places we went to, including Quincy Market and airport."

After spending the days in the buzzing city it was a real retreat to get home to the cosy, relaxed and beautiful home of the Carney Family. Barney and Mary had good recommendations on what to do in and around Boston and the smell of freshly baked muffins made getting up in the morning very easy. Thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home. I can highly recommend it."
1544702,94650484,2016-08-16,19018611,Patricia,Très bon accueil mais nous avons été surpris du nombre de chambres louées et donc du nombre de personnes présentez même si la maison est grande. Les muffins du petit déjeuner étaient délicieux. Il était très appréciable d'avoir la climatisation vu les très fortes chaleurs!

1544702,96423512,2016-08-22,6390993,Markus,"We enjoyed very much staying two nights at the Carney family's well located and nicely decorated home. Our room was as described, all bathrooms very clean, and tea and muffins in the morning provided a good start for our Boston sightseeing. Getting to the city center is very convenient from the subway station nearby. In summer, don't miss lounging for a while on the wonderful front porch. Only small downside: our room's aircondition was quite noisy at night - and it couldn't be turned off, because it's a central system for all rooms."
1544702,97131291,2016-08-26,64791038,John,"We cannot fault anything - it really was a great stay here. The photos do not do this apartment justice either, they were lovely and the simple but tasty breakfast was also a welcome surprise. The location is ideal; 5 minute walk to the subway with a 10 minute train ride into the centre of Boston. There is also free parking on a private drive."
1544702,99241699,2016-09-04,66763180,Mika,Great neighborhood and close proximity to the T. Will be returning!

9238963,75055310,2016-05-18,69449231,Mike,"Jill was a perfect host. She made it easy to pick up the keys, left us clean sheets and towels and offered tips on exploring Boston. Her place was incredibly convenient -- within walking distance of BU, Fenway Park and the Copley T station. We couldn't have asked for a better spot to stay for our three-day mini vacation. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."

7575576,45015552,2015-08-30,19065904,Tim,"Roma was very accommodating with getting us the keys.   And the place was clean and in a good location.  There was not a problem parking as we were there on the weekend but I could see weekdays being an issue.  The place is pretty basic, it's a 3 floor walk up which is fine and  there's no A/C but there are fans.  There seems to be an issue with the stove pilot light cause we smelled gas when came in and there were written instructions on lighting the pilot light.  All in all it was perfect for us.  One night in and out."
7575576,45981613,2015-09-07,34521384,Viral,"Great place, great host. Everything was clean and tidy.

7575576,47427261,2015-09-18,23168357,Dave,"Room is exactly what it sounds like, and Roma is nice. There is however a problem with the door, as I left for work the door handle fell off. Rather than call a locksmith and replace it, Roma decided to fix it himself and pieced it together with scotch tape. So the place is fine, but make sure the door handle is fixed."

11223924,72269335,2016-05-01,13342411,Ed,"Jason stopped by the charming apartment to see that everything was okay, which it was. He is a professional and cares about customers' experience deeply."
11223924,72885029,2016-05-05,4994324,Patricia,"The apartment was first class, very clean and well equipped. We didn't meet the host in person but all arrangements were very concise and accurate. The location is an easy walk to the waterfront and downtown Boston with lots of restaurants nearby."
11223924,74274196,2016-05-14,59183455,Deian,"Without question, a good apartment is preferable to a standard, or even better than standard, hotel room.  Jason's apartment in North End raises the bar even further.  It is extremely well situated - in a most attractive area, with plenty of restaurants but also great food shops and wine stores, and very near the Metro and stations and, of course, key attractions on the Freedom Trail.   The apartment is well equipped and beautifully furnished and, above all, it is quiet !  The television (if you have time for it) is excellent - and we were able to use our own Netflix account.   All of this made for a great week in Boston and I thoroughly recommend this apartment.  Jason himself was efficient and most welcoming - a fine host."
11223924,76534918,2016-05-28,7006909,Marielle,Jason was a great host and very available! The apartment is gorgeous and the location is perfect! Super easy check in and check out! It was a great experience all together!
11223924,77169392,2016-05-30,5702920,Mary,"We had a wonderful stay at Jason's beautiful apartment. Jason is very responsive and helpful; we especially appreciated the list of favorite restaurants he sent us the week leading up to our trip. The apartment was spotless and elegantly designed; we had everything we needed. And in the heart of historic North End Boston, we were steps away from awesome restaurants and activities. Added bonuses: amazing view on the rooftop; incredibly comfortable sectional and bed. Will definitely try to stay with Jason again our next trip to Boston!"
11223924,78043904,2016-06-05,9196456,Kai,"\"Jason's place is as described, as pictures depicted in the airbnb listing.  It is like new.  Everything is tastefully decorated and comfortable.  The location is also very convenient to everything.  When we arrived at Jason'e place, I mistakenly thought the kitchen faucet didn't work.  Jason is such a conscientious host.  He replied to my texts immediately  trying to solve the problem.  Unfortunately, I fell asleep without checking my phone.  Jason braved the rush hour traffic and came to fix the \"\"non-existing\"\" problem.  It turned out that the kitchen faucet worked fine.  I felt really embarrassed and guilty to have to waste Jason's time to come over.  But he was very gracious about it all.  Jason is a wonderful host.  His place is great.  I definitely will recommend it to everyone.\""
11223924,78748198,2016-06-08,57682017,Mike,"Simply Amazing!!!  Perfect for 2. I would give the place, cleanliness, location, and most of all attention to detail customer service an 5/5 stars!   Upon arrival we had and issue with one of the a/c units in the bedroom.  Jason took my call on the first ring, rushed from work, understood the issue, and then offered us free food and drinks on his tab!!  While we declined and headed out for the day, Jason went out and bought a window a/c unit (mind you driving a scooter) and we came back to an ice cold room!  He and his family manage many properties around Boston, and I wouldn't even bother renting from anyone else.  I will grab this unit when I shortly travel back for work."
11223924,79354711,2016-06-12,70819681,Thalie,"Amazing stay, apartment was fully renovated and decorated with taste and extremely clean, very comfortable bed, nice historical neighborhood. Thank you Jason for the stay!"
11223924,81659858,2016-06-24,69401478,Merlyn,"Great neighborhood, nice place to stay. It's small but perfect for 2 or 3 persons. It directly felt comfortable and as if being at home. Beautiful furniture and style. Also great to have all the basics like shampoo, handwash, tablets available. We would have preferred to keep our luggage in the room a bit longer instead of downstairs in an open area. This was unfortunately not possible whilst the cleaning did not come for hours later and no new visitors. So a bit more flexibility would have made it really perfect."
11223924,81774976,2016-06-25,11667189,Michael,Jason was an amazing host. He made us feel very welcome in Boston. He was available if we needed anything which was comforting. This was a stop on our way back from a camping trip and what a great end to our trip it was. I had only been to Boston a few times but I am looking forward to going back and using Jason's Air Bnb again.

The North End neighborhood is pretty amazing and Jason went above and beyond with his communication and recommendations. We would definitely recommend his place and stay here again."

11223924,88276237,2016-07-23,64965026,Cecile,"Our host wrote to us on the first morning of our stay to welcome us and make himself available for anything we might need during our stay. We were quick to mention that apartment was perfect and spotless, however our bed was not comfortable. Our host went that afternoon and within hours he provided a brand new matress. We were very surprised and greatful,  we did not expect this level of service. This was our first short term rental, we rented for 8 days and everything in the apartment was in mint condition."
Location was perfect,close to T,water front and in a great spot in the NorthEnd away from crowds,close to public parking and within walking distance to great markets.,,
Kitchen was fully equiped and we enjoyed making home made meals with fresh ingridients we bought around the neighborhood.,,,,,

Chloe was very responsive and answered all of our questions in a timely way and was accessible for questions as they arose. Her apartment is as described, sunny and cozy and definitely enough space for two people. It is well located in the South End of Boston, near many coffee shops, restaurants and walking distance to the T and Back Bay. There is a beautiful spot to sit all day and stare at the view by the window. The kitchen is great for cooking. Overall a great experience and would highly recommend staying here!"

She provided me with detailed directions to access her apartment and great recommendations for awesome places to go nearby. Chloe was always accessible by phone/text and extremely helpful when I had any questions. The apartment is spacious, beautifully decorated, gets a lot of natural light, and has a good view of the neighborhood. I would definitely recommend others to stay there.  I would love to book again on my next visit."
9896359,70426957,2016-04-17,30319006,Ryan,The apartment was beautiful and located in a great neighborhood. The entire city of Boston is at your fingertips. Chloe was friendly and accommodating and check-in/check-out were a breeze. Would visit again.
9896359,73661948,2016-05-09,54785955,Lori,The apt was exactly as described.  The natural light was a great benefit since it rained every day of our stay.  The apt was large enough for us to entertain family during our visit.

It was, by far, the best deal I could find. My roommates were all friendly and courteous and the entire house was very quiet which helped me a lot for my study. I would recommend this house for anyone seeking a clean, quiet and safe place, particularly for long term."
8987722,52802739,2015-11-01,20233625,Lauryn,"I had a great experience with Josh. The apartment was extremely clean and was just like the pictures. Had slight issue retrieving key but that wasn't Josh's fault, the front desk didn't know where it was put. Overall, pleasant and comfy experience."

The apartment is beautiful and the building is brand new and awesome! It is very dog friendly with treats at the front desk and even a dog wash in the basement. There are 2 gym areas to chose from and the common rooms are really cool and handy for guests. The concierge was so nice and helpful.,,,,,
Indoor parking was a treat and upon checkin,when we discovered the designated parking spot had a low vent/sprinkler hanging over it,Josh was able to put us in another spot that was high enough for our vehicle.,,,
Being next to the whole foods was super handy and the neighborhood was close to everything for us...a short bike or easy drive to anywhere and completely walkable to a great park (with a dog run) and lots of cute restaurants and shops.,,,,,
There's also a bike room and bike rack in the parking garage which was super helpful.,,,,,

8987722,59664881,2016-01-13,38398954,Ron,Everything about this transaction and trip were top notch. The condo exceeded expectations and provided a terrific place for me to feel at home while attending a conference. Having Whole Foods next door is a real plus. Josh was fantastic to work with and I would highly recommend his place. Getting an Uber was super easy.
8987722,60354287,2016-01-22,5107301,Adam,"I've stayed in a bunch of AirBnB's and this was one of the best. Easy check-in process, the apartment was great, about a 6 minute walk from the South End and the Whole Foods downstairs was amazing. Josh was responsive and easy to work with, and he provided everything I needed for a seamless stay. Amenities in the bathroom were a nice touch, and the bed was super-comfortable."

8987722,61536276,2016-02-05,49276195,Milanie,"The unit was fabulous.  Upon arrival I found a spotless, well-appointed unit for my week stay in Boston.  The building is modern and the furnishings in the unit are similarly styled.  The kitchen is equipped with what one would need for a short stay and the kitchen layout made cooking a meal fun.  There were towels, travel-sized shampoos and soaps, extra blankets and comforters for the bed if needed.  The bed is comfortable and the closet is large enough so that if one feels inclined to pack a lot, it's possible to put everything away and keep the clutter out of sight, inclusive of suitcases.  I have more work trips to Boston in the offing and will try to stay again.  Highly recommended."
8987722,61839778,2016-02-08,48352912,Sebastian,"Modern, clean place that was great for the value. Easy to get around to various locations in Boston. Host was prompt with replying to concerns."

We walked through Chinatown, to The Commons and over to the North End for lunch. The apartment is in a nice area, right next to Whole Foods.  We really enjoyed having Whole Foods just steps away. We were tired when we arrived, and it was so nice to get our dinner, and things for breakfast all at Whole Foods."
The apartment is super clean and very well appointed,there is everything one would need to make a meal.   There are plenty of towels,also soap,and shampoo are provided.  The washer and dryer are right in the apartment,they are new and work great.  The bed is comfortable and the linens we new and nice.,

8987722,67225649,2016-03-27,61875757,Andy,"Leading up to our trip, Josh was really responsive and communicative; that was great. Full disclosure: this was our first AB&B experience, so maybe there are parts of our experience a more seasoned ABB person wouldn't finch at. The apartment was modern and clean, the front desk people super nice. Whole Foods next door was fantastic; laundry in-apartment is wonderful (detergent included)! While at first it seemed as though we were out in the boonies, after a day or so we realized how small Boston really is, and became adept at walking and taking the T (Tufts Medical stop 10-minute walk). The bummer of the location is freeway noise and, on some mornings, airport noise. There was also super loud construction that started RIGHT above us each morning at 8. All resulted in much earlier mornings than we wanted. This is really a place for two people. The queen bed is wonderfully comfortable; the linens aren't super if you're one to notice thread count. The pull-out bed, even for our two small teens, was not ideal. There is an AeroBed we used after a first night of misery on top of the pull-out. When we first arrived, we realized a few things amiss: 3 coffee mugs and drinking glasses not 4, missing comforter cover for the pull-out bed (needed because the comforter itself had some dark stains on it), no hair dryer as advertised, plastic melted on stove, tea kettle with rusted bottom that leaked on stove. Some of this we just wanted Josh to know about so we weren't held responsible for, and so he could consult with cleaners about; others needed to be handled (comforter cover and hair dryer). We weren't trying to be overly picky, but it felt like that's how it was received. ABB ethos seems to be all about open communication, so that's how we approached it. We contacted him Wed. evening and didn't get the cover until Friday; as for the hair dryer, he suggested we go to Whole Foods to buy one and he would reimburse us. With this particular communication, we found him less responsive, which was a bummer. This is one of those hotel vs ABB things; a hotel would have responded not at their convenience, but at our request. We also needed parking; Josh suggested a Herald St. garage, but there are two, both private. We found one for $15 a day several blocks away. At one point all of our electronic keys stopped working; front desk handled it, but it took 30 - 40 minutes. There were some times where no one was at the desk; not sure what we'd have done in that situation; maybe the other building always has someone? While Josh can't control the construction (or traffic! or airplanes!), I'd certainly suggest asking if construction has stopped before booking. If you have a guarantee that it has, and do NOT need the pull-out bed, this is certainly place to consider."
8987722,68789889,2016-04-06,62486753,Nate,Easy check-in / check-out. Great location in a rapidly developing area.
The space was clean,organized and exactly as advertised with some nice extras thrown in (blow-up mattress,for example).,,,
"I would definitely recommend. \"",,,,,
8987722,69149786,2016-04-09,22025920,Renato,"The apartment is really nice: everything is brand new and comfortable. Also it is fully equipped and a 15-min walk to Boston Commons, 10 min to Copley Square and reasonably close to subway. It also has a large supermarket right below. The check-in process was a bit confusing since we arrived after 11pm but it was eventually sorted out."
8987722,69665092,2016-04-12,35073190,Hanna,Boston is such a great city and the apartment pretty well located. It was easy to get around. The INK Block is amazingly well equipped and has a great vibe to it as it's full of young and fun residents (yet quiet). Very friendly and helpful Concierges too. Biggest advantage is definitively the Wholefood market next door.
Booking process was easy and Josh was very responding. Check-in flawless.,,,,,
The condo was as advertised and overall clean. I couldn't help but notice that dishes from the previous guests were left in the dishwasher (clean though),a TV remote control was dead,towels had some stains and that a garbage bin could use a washing-off. I did love the fact that there were laundry facilities in place,small bathroom amenities and stable WiFi connection. The bed was HEAVEN and so was the duvet.,,
From previous experiences,I was missing a welcome note or a quick text message asking if everything was ok but communication pretty much stopped the day I arrived. Instead,"I received a reminder about check-out time on departure day which I found a little heartless. The apartment had a bit of a \"\"corporate\"\" feel to it but it is definitively a very good place to stay at. You just gotta choose whether you prefer your host to be around or not and if you like your Airbnb a \"\"home away from home\"\" - or not.",,,

8987722,69872834,2016-04-14,32130900,John,The listing was spot on accurate! no surprises.  It was my first AirBnb experience and certainly not my last.  I did a little research...The selling price for that property and what we were able to rent it for makes it an unbeatable deal....I'm totally staying there again if I attend any event in Boston!!!
8987722,70125803,2016-04-16,53780054,Rico,Great location. Building is very elegant with all the bells and whistles. Can't beat the value for the price. I was able to get to the T line no issues with a short walk. I was also able to walk to Newbury in no time. Check-in and check out was easy. Host was extremely and responsive. Host was also flexible with me on my check out because my departure was delayed. Will definitely rebook when in Boston.

The apartment was perfect. Getting in was straightforward. We also took advantage of the car parking space.,,,,,
Location was great for a couple of Brits holidaying in Boston. 20 mins or so walk got us to back bay,and the same in the other direction to some superb south end eateries.,,,,
As others have said the adjacent Whole Foods is super convenient. I was quickly addicted to the smoothies for breakfast!,,,,,
Depending on what you have planned I don't think you really need a rental car. Most of the stuff we wanted to do simply involved a bit of walking - ideal to work off the amazing brunches which are plentiful!  We only used our car once to head off to one of the shopping malls.,,,,,
I even booked myself in to a cycle class at turnstyle which is in inkb 1 - and they were super friendly and helpful - another opportunity to work off those brunches and it was only about $15 for the class.,,,,,

Also, you can get access to all the amenities in the building. Josh is a great and responsive host as well. He provided  informative details before we arrived, checked in with us during our stay, and gave us instructions for an easy check-out as well. We really enjoyed our stay."

He responded within minutes to any questions I had, and the apartment was exactly as described. The apartment is located in South End next to Whole Foods, great restaurants, and trendy bars. We did not use the amenities in the building, but there was a gym & pool. There is not a baggage check available in the building. Since our plane arrived prior to checkin, we checked our bags at a local hotel for a tip fee- very easy."
This was our first stay with Airbnb,and it far exceeded my expectations. We usually stay in hotels,but this was much more comfortable and felt like home. The simple things like having a full size kitchen to cook breakfast and have coffee; that place to store groceries for the week instead of eating out every meal; or just having a place to wash that sweater because the temp dropped,and you didn't pack enough warm clothes. We will be traveling back to Boston soon,"and we will definitely stay with Josh again!\"",
8987722,81105519,2016-06-21,60976494,César Enrique,Fue grandioso. Todo estaba en orden cuando llegamos. el barrio es muy central.
8987722,81768644,2016-06-25,74383437,Cerish,"We loved our stay at Josh's apartment, it was a perfect base for our travel around town. The apartment itself is LOVELY !! There is a Whole Foods right next door, and that is a great convenience whether you want to grab some groceries or pick your dinner up. The apartment itself is spacious and very clean. We really enjoyed our stay, and I would gladly recommend Josh to anyone visiting Boston."
8987722,82668975,2016-06-28,1754474,Susie,"Nice, comfortable condo, worked wonderfully well for us on our trip to our son's wedding in Boston.  Nice, comfortable condo, worked wonderfully well for us on our trip to our son's wedding in Boston. Totally convenient having Whole Foods next door."
8987722,83812586,2016-07-04,1730887,Tanmay,"Josh isn't on premise - and the key card was left in the apartment. The listing page describes the place and the amenities perfectly. Everything is new, clean and urbanized."
Josh has a fantastic place in a great location. We were able to Uber to most of Boston for under $10. Not to mention,the Whole Foods on premise is fantastic. The unit is clean with all the amenities. Ink Block itself is quite pet friendly with lots of owners walking their dogs. I would recommend getting the parking in the parking garage through Josh - charges not included with the stay - its easier especially when traveling with little kids.,,,,
On premise gym is small but has all that you can ask for. The pool is nice - and the outdoor patio area is great as well.,,,,,
The whole of Ink Block is secured with key card access as well.,,,,,
There was some confusion with the concierge regarding parking pass as well as entry to the apartment. There was no note left for the parking garage opener. The apartment concierge did have a note but could not find it,so we were left waiting for 20 min or so. This isn't Josh's fault - but coming into a new city with kids left us with wanting a smoother arrival.,,,,
Al in all,"we would definitely stay with Josh again. \"",,,,
8987722,86047744,2016-07-14,18745257,Grant,"pros:  great neighborhood.  loved the whole foods right there.  josh did a good job of taking care of everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  Laundry, internet, and kitchen.   but really, the best thing about this is being so close to downtown boston in a nice modern complex."
cons: parking was on street and public pay garages,"loud construction going on every morning i was there (heavy duty posts driving into the ground at 8 every morning.)  \"",,,,
8987722,87551104,2016-07-20,68458461,Jessica,"This is a great place and the location is fantastic - so easy to get around the city and its located close to major sites, great restaurants, pubs, cafes and stores.

Appart et immeuble très cool. L'épicerie situé au bas de l'immeuble est vraiment pratique. Tout est accessible par marche. Nous y retournerions sans hésitation.  Présentement, comme mentionné par Josh, il y a des travaux et des immeubles en construction, ce qui rend le \"\"voisinage\"\" un peu moins attrayant"
8987722,90904242,2016-08-02,70658745,Raymond,"The location is great (right next to Chinatown) and the room itself is A+. Utilities were great, however there was very much a hotel feel to the whole experience. Not much homeliness from this place. Some small things like no trashcan in the kitchen and low quality tp were annoying. Overall the stay was great. Nice bedding and furniture."

8987722,94097361,2016-08-14,48082893,James,Josh has a great and clean place. If you bring your walking shoes you could pretty much get to anywhere in the city. The Whole Foods was very convenient. We would stay again.
8987722,95647716,2016-08-20,11926140,Blanche,"Très bon séjour à Boston. Appartement très agréable, bien situé, le metro a quelques minutes a pied. Piscine exterieure dans le bloc just a cote, (tres agréable apres une journee a visiter), possibilité de s'y installer jusqu'a 21h et d'utiliser les BBQ a disposition. IPetits points d'amelioration possible : la literie du canapé lit dans le salon, et un peu plus de vaisselle dans la cuisine. Mais nous revindrons sans probleme."

1545185,8068290,2013-10-14,9175278,Ronald,Nice and fair home to stay at! Nick's suggestions of where to go and eat were helpful!  Short walk to T and quiet neighborhood.
1545185,8412978,2013-10-29,8067562,Thomas,"Beautiful, well kept space with a bunch of fun goodies (large screen TV, well tooled kitchen, great interior design). Nick was perfectly hospitable - couldn't have asked for more."

Comfortable sleeping and lounging, and we took advantage of the big flatscreen TV and Bose ipod dock. Nick made staying here easy and I'd definitely come back."
1545185,8646041,2013-11-10,9672500,Joshua,"Nick is truly a great host. Incredibly communicative, and the property is perfect. Easy, great value, and Nick is clearly a savvy Airbnb host worthy of showcasing. The property was perfect for business travel: like an incredibly wired studio with entertainment galore and a great kitchen! Great job at turning a finished basement studio into a sleek, comfortable, warm destination."
1545185,8786458,2013-11-18,9355466,Dan,"Nick is an amazing host! He is very nice, patient and a helpful person. Answered all of our questions instantly and gave us great tips to start with. We had the best time in his great and very well equipped apartment. Used the big flat screen TV and the kick ass kitchen! The apartment is close to a lot of great restaurants and main shopping centers. Also, it has warm water 24\\7 as promised and very well heated and clean. Also the laundry machine and dryer works great and gets your clothes nice and clean. We recommend Nick's place for your next vacation/ business trip and would come back at any time! You will get for your money not only a very comfy and neat place but also a great host and a great person that will help you instantly with all of your questions."

Nick was super acommodating of my pets (large dog and cat) and always very responsive to our questions.  There's parking right behind the unit, which was super convenient.  The apartment is located in a cute, quiet neighborhood, with a huge park nearby which the pup LOVED.  The kitchen was really nice, updated beautifully, though light on actual pots and pans, so I'd suggest bringing some of your own to supplement if you're staying for any length of time.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and would definitely consider staying again if we were in a similar situation."

Having parking is a huge plus as well, and our dog loved exploring the backyard. Nick was friendly and helpful throughout the booking process, as well as when we arrived at the apartment. Would definitely stay again!"
1545185,14862576,2014-06-28,14361190,Muxi,"pros: It is a nice apt. Taking use of the basement space, Nick made it into a cozy place for living. It is interesting to explore how the space is used to the fullest. It has all the amenities listed and a nice TV. The kitchen is also amazing."
cons: As expected,you shouldn't complain about the sunshine and ventilation if you accept it as a basement apt. The entry way  and the front door is messy,at least for me. There were some other problems I reported to Nick,yet I DO believe they are solvable. Although they are not included in the space I rented for,it is definitely part of the life there. Everybody will like going out in the morning greeted by a tidy,clean
"Nick is a good host after all. He responses quickly and finally took the trouble for me to alter and cancel the reservation. Thank you Nick. And best wishes.\"",,,,,
1545185,18569363,2014-08-28,19661823,Laura,"The apartment was perfect. It had a brand new kitchen with granite countertops and a nice bathroom fully stocked with hair dryer, soap, etc. We had a really comfortable stay and loved exploring the charming neighborhood. Washington Street and many restaurants are just 5 minutes away. Also, we took the green line T into town many times easily. We just walked about 10 minutes to the stop and hopped on. Before we knew it, we were in downtown Boston. The electronics in the apartment were incredibly easy to use, superb wifi, DVD's, BlueRays, etc."

I actually didn't get a chance to meet him in person, but he was quick to answer via the AirBnB messaging system when I had any questions or requests.  His apartment was exactly as described on the listing page; it was very comfortable.  It actually seemed bigger than the pictures made it out to be.  The bathroom and kitchen were seemingly recently renovated.  We also enjoyed his collection of board games and Netflix.  Good times with Mad Gab."
I went to meet up with old college friends and to catch the Boston College football game (BC > USC); Nick's apartment is fairly close to campus,"about a 25 minute walk.  I would recommend his place to anyone looking to stay for a BC football weekend.  \"",,,,

It was clean and roomy, big enough for 3 people.  It's in a quiet neighborhood next to a fantastic park.  It's close to Cleveland Circle and a short drive to Coolidge Corner, where there are lots of restaurants, bars, movie theater, etc.  I would recommend this apt."
1545185,21623714,2014-10-20,21336090,Corban,"I stayed at Nick's place while attending a BC alumni event, and it was excellent.

Thanks Nick!"

We were in town for a game at BC, so was nice + convenient to that, however, if you're looking for the full Boston experience, it's not the most convenient place - though it is close to the T and quite walkable. I highly recommend Jim's Deli up the street if you stay here - great breakfast!"

I was traveling with my parents and 2 boys and they loved the park next door. The kitchen and bathroom were nicely upgraded and Nick was very thoughtful about leaving out spare towels and sheets. Overall we had a very pleasant experience and Nick was very accommodating about check out times too. He also arranged for extra bedding on top of the bedroom and futon, knowing we were 3 adults and 2 kids."
1545185,34485430,2015-06-08,33675986,Sean,Nick was great!  This was my first time using the service and he answered all my questions leading up to our trip.
He was there when we arrived,showed us around and then headed out.,,,,
His place is very accessible to all the places we wanted to go and only about a $15 Uber from downtown.,,,,,
It was a quick trip,so we didn't spend a lot of time at the house,"but will consider using his place again if we head back.\"",,,

1545185,49021138,2015-09-30,24712795,Laurent,Le lieu est très loin du centre. On peut y aller par transport en commun mais c'est long.
Le lieu en soi n'était pas sale,mais du fait qu'il s'agissait d'un garage de maison aménagé,il était assez humide (malgré la présence d'une machine permettant de déshumidifier l'air) et surtout j'ai pu constater l'arrivée d'un mille-patte (!) dans la salle de bain.,,,
On avait un sentiment relatif d'insalubrité au final. Pas très accueillant.,,,,,
Par contre,de gros aménagements ont été faits pour la location.,,,,
Autre souci,on entendait absolument tout de ce qui se passait à l'étage au dessus (spécialement dans le salon) : télé bruyante,pas de gens et de chien,le chien qui aboyait a 6h du matin ou a 23h ...,,
Ce que je regrette est le manque de communication. Difficile d'avoir des réponses de l'hôte pour savoir où se trouve le lieu avant mon arrivée et manque de communication en ce qui concerne le wifi à mon arrivée (peu d'informations et erronées qui plus est,"mais qui s'est reglé par la suite). Informations sommaires quant aux questions que j'avais sur Boston et ses alentours.\"",,,,

We really felt like home. His kitchen was fully equipped and the bed was super comfortable. Everything in the house was rather new and the rooms and the bathroom were very clean. The backyard was fantastic, with a nice barbeque for sunny days. Craig was also an excellent host and responded immediately to all our questions. We really enjoyed our stay at his place, and would come back for sure!"
5380160,32333763,2015-05-17,4539193,Adrian,"Craig accommodated our early arrival, met us at the apt to let us in. We felt safe it a safe neighborhood and Broadway is short walk, with a grocery store, coffee shops close by. The T is a few blocks and you're off to downtown, or hop on a bus. A lot of things are walking distance, especially the conference center, 10 mins."
5380160,33607406,2015-05-30,4099046,Marc,"Craig's place was exactly as described.  I was in town for a conference and this place was perfect, only a 10 minute walk to the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center.  Also, a nice grocery store and several restaurants were just a few blocks away.  Arrival was easy, with gated access, the place was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Craig was always quick to reply and accommodating.  I'll definitely stay here the next time I'm in Boston."
5380160,46287237,2015-09-09,39387720,Andrea,"This apartment is located in a great neighborhood a short walk from the Broadway T stop.  It has plenty of room for 2 people and overall has a nice look and feel to it.  Getting in and out of the apartment was easy as the instructions were accurate and detailed.  Given it is a basement apartment, you must be comfortable staying below where people live, expect some walking noise but nothing more.  Overall the only issue we had was the apartment is very dark because it is a basement apartment, with the light blocking curtains, it was very difficult to determine the morning and wake up.  The bed was very comfortable and so it made it extra difficult to wake up.  The bathroom was very nice looking but the shower glass doesn't block all water from getting out and therefore the floors got a little wet.  Overall we were very satisfied with our stay"
5380160,46596294,2015-09-12,4943344,Christopher,"Craig's place was perfect for my stay in South Boston. Needing to get quickly to the BCEC and have a home base, this fit the bill. Just a few blocks from the Foodie's market, which gave me the essentials, I was able to keep the fridge full of my own stuff and had comfortable surroundings that allowed me to get work done. I will stay here as many times as I travel to Boston."

5380160,47476570,2015-09-19,15698386,Josh,"Craig was a fantastic host. He was always there with a simple text message when I needed him. The apartment has everything that I needed to make my stay a great one, and it was updated with all the modern amenities. The apartment is on the bottom floor, so you can hear everything the upstairs tenants are doing, but most apartments are like this. The bed was super comfortable, and the air conditioning worked like a charm (very important for me). I cooked a few meals there and loved the gas stove! Craig's place made this stay a great one, and he is a super nice guy as well! I would definitely recommend his place to anyone needing a nice and comfortable place while visiting Boston.

5380160,53194010,2015-11-06,46495337,Debra,"Enjoyed my stay at Craig's place--it was clean, nicely furnished/decorated, and located in a charming neighborhood within walking distance of my conference. Craig was great to converse with when I had questions and made sure things were ready for my arrival. My only word of caution is to communicate specifically about check-out procedure as it may not be what you're used to. Other than that my stay was super comfortable and I'd recommend this as a great option for South Boston."
5380160,56882233,2015-12-19,36622446,John,Craig was fantastic. apartment was great!
5380160,58730987,2016-01-03,52646811,Hannah,Great place to stay while in town! Craig was quick to respond and his home was in perfect condition for guests. Thanks!
5380160,59572922,2016-01-12,8810670,Andrea,"We were so pleased to have found this apartment. Not only was it cozy, comfortable and extremely stylish, the location was perfect. Just a few minutes walk to the Convention centre it was a haven for us to return to after long days on our feet exhibiting. The close proximity to shops and eateries was also a big plus and the neighbourhood perfectly charming. Checking in and out was a doddle and although we never met Craig in person he has been very helpful by email. As a first time visitor to Boston I would recommend wholeheartedly staying in Craig's home."

5380160,68871476,2016-04-07,51634592,Subashini,It's a great place to stay in Boston . Was very comfortable and cosy . Convenient to walk 15 mins to convention Centre as well . App place for 2 . Clean and utensils available for cooking too. Overall I will recommend this place .

The apartment itself is clean, quiet, comfortable, convenient, and quite well-equipped.  I very much enjoyed my stay, and I look forward to staying again."
5380160,80085368,2016-06-16,75934667,Annie,Craig was always available to answer to my questions. The place was clean and quiet. The first night I have arrived late and it was not easy to find place to park my car. The day after I have parked my car in a public parking (safe place - 10 min walk from Craig's place) The cost is 25$ per day but the it has a special rate when you let your car there for overnight (20$).

It's nice and close to the convention center. I also used the nearby gym,Boston Athletic Club,"which is a 5 minute jog. I enjoyed staying there and was very comfortable. Craig was out of town but didn't need him for anything. \"",,,

7789055,43788542,2015-08-22,18292286,Gwynne,This apartment was exactly what I needed while studying at Boston University for a week.
Great location - It is an easy walk across the river,and the neighborhood is safe and comfortable to walk through at night (and there were always other walkers,joggers,and cyclists out).  There is a Trader Joe's practically across the street,and Whole Foods is a short walk away.  Across the river (by BU,again
Comfortable apartment - The apartment is comfortable and well-furnished,although a dresser in the guest bedroom would be nice (although a tight fit).  The overhead lights in the guest bedroom and closet didn't work - not a problem,though,because there was a desk lamp that offered plenty of light.  The apartment was well-soundproofed - I never heard noise from other apartments,or even from my roommate in the second bedroom.  Beds were comfy - I slept really well!  Great air-conditioning unit - thank goodness,because the temperatures were in the 90s all week!  Kitchen utensils are a bit sparse - a baking sheet would have been useful
I didn't know the sofa was a pull-out bed,but it would be awfully crowded with that many people staying.  This was perfect for me and my roommate.  If we'd both had our husbands with us we would've been falling all over each other.  Then again,I'm not used to city living,this apartment was palatial by New York City standards!,,
One warning - be careful getting out of the shower!  The floor tile is very smooth and slippery with wet feet.  Ellen had stocked the bathroom with everything you might need (shampoo,conditioner,body wash).,,,
Someone that stayed previously complained that their keys didn't work. Ellen gave us two sets of keys,and they both worked fine,"although one was a little \"\"finicky\"\" - you had to put the key in and pull it out again slightly to get it to turn.  Not a big deal.",,,
This apartment is a third floor walk-up,and it seems like an older building,so the landings and staircases are a little crooked. Something to think about if you have any difficulty walking.,,,
Internet is fine,but a little slow if you have to do a lot of online work (I was doing dissertation research,so it was occasionally frustrating).,,,
Ellen was a good host.  She was very cooperative in allowing me to hold onto my parking pass after check-out time so that I didn't have to find parking at BU and was very flexible about what time we were checking in.  I just called her 30 minutes before arriving and she met me to show me the apartment,where I could park,and where things like the T stop and Trader Joe's were.,,,
A good stay!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
7789055,44228820,2015-08-24,4407139,Andrew,"This is the perfect place! Ellen is wonderful and her apartment is a few steps away from Riverside Boat Club. As a crew of rowers we couldn't have asked for a better place, host or location."
"Thanks so much Ellen! Highly recommend.\"",,,,,
7789055,44362435,2015-08-25,820301,Robert,Great location. Host was responsive and accessible. Place was modernized but cleanliness was an issue.  Hopefully a new cleaner will fix that.
7789055,45615460,2015-09-04,11035908,Jennifer,"Ellen was very friendly, helpful and responsive. The apartment was perfect for our needs--clean, comfortable, modern and up-to-date appliances, quiet building. The neighborhood is great--Trader Joes is close by, and it was an easy walk to BU, as well as Central Square. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay there again."

7789055,47758861,2015-09-21,4995975,Lauren,Ellen was accommodating to our later than expected check in. The apartment is adequate for a night's stay but doesn't feel very homey.
7789055,48133342,2015-09-23,9350849,Ian,"This was my first Airbnb experience.  I have to say is was mostly positive.  The place was described and advertised as received. The pictures were accurate and the location was very accessible within Cambridge,MA and only about a 10 min walk to T station.  The unit does not have a television, this was not a huge concern given I only stayed 2 nights, but something I overlooked on booking.  I would recommend."
7789055,48215174,2015-09-24,43382837,Olivia,"Ellen's apartment was great. The location was perfect!  Everything in the apartment was as described.  The apartment was close to Traders Joe, whole foods. And MIT, Boston University.  The neighborhood is nice and quite just as mentioned .  We started off with a little  bit of a hiccup in regards to the parking permit.  Ellen went over and above to help us. Everything turned out well. Thank you Ellen ,"

The only draw back is the it's located about 15 min. walking from T station,should be take into consideration when arriving with heavy luggage or on bad weather days..,,,,

7789055,50210657,2015-10-10,36597547,Sarah,"Ellen's apartment is in a lovely tranquil road in Cambridge and we enjoyed the closeness to Hsrvard Square for the range of restaurants. We only stayed one night but the apartment was as described, and the beds were really comfortable. Sadly we did not get to meet Ellen but she had made arrangements for us to get into the apartment ."
7789055,50324847,2015-10-11,832265,Jim,Ellen was easy to reach on our arrival and the checking in was easy.  Nice apartment in an excellent neighborhood.  Walked to Trader Joe's just around the corner for a few things.  Apartment was nice and had everything we needed.

7789055,50832561,2015-10-15,34692321,Jacqueline,"Ellen was a fabulous host; extremely responsive and very pleasant to deal with.  She was flexible with our check-in time so that we could drop our luggage off at the apartment before exploring the city.  Having a parking permit was wonderful and we never had any issue, any time of day, finding a parking spot.  The T station was an easy 10 min walk into Central Square.  The apartment was upgraded from when we originally booked it and it looks wonderful.  It was extremely clean and well maintained.  The rooms are small but that is to be expected in Boston and certainly wouldn't keep us from booking it again!"
7789055,52071699,2015-10-26,32081207,C. Elizabeth,"Ellen was easy to communicate with. The apartment was clean and as described, with enough towels, kitchen utensils, etc. The parking pass was very useful and we found street parking easily in front of the apartment.

7789055,52369822,2015-10-28,45237011,Stephen,Very convenient location. Twenty minutes to airport in morning commute. Nice quiet building and neighborhood. Place was clean and as stated.
7789055,52525086,2015-10-30,46052161,Peter,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ellen's apt.  Very well located for central Boston and for Harvard, the T-line is a good 10 minute walk away which is quite tough after a hard days walking.  But, returning to a quiet, warm and well appointed apt with comfortable beds greatly aids recovery.  Good value for central Boston including parking."
7789055,52885830,2015-11-02,25822680,Colleen,Description was accurate. Neighborhood was lovely. Trader Joe's is two blocks away. Mass Ave is a good walk but not bad. There were four of us and the place was perfect. Parking pass was a PLUS!
7789055,53164074,2015-11-05,47989662,Kate,Ellen is super responsive and made my short stay very easy!  The location is perfect.  I enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and it was great that Trader Joe's and Starbucks were just a block away.  Thanks Ellen!

7789055,59062755,2016-01-06,49936856,Sihai,We spent a wonderful time in Boston. Thanks for the warm and nice apartment gave us a good rest. The location is very convenient to take bus and subway. Ellen is pretty nice to help us and answer our questions during this travel. A very good memory for us. Thank you.

Ellen helped us with directions to the T line and places that were close for groceries.  This apartment was a 15 minute walk for the T line.  Also a block away from Trader Joes and close to a Starbucks.  The apartment fit our family of 6.  It was cozy, we had enough blankets and towels.  It was a quiet apartment.  It was a great time and we loved our stay here.  I would recommend this apartment or stay in one of Ellen's properties again."
7789055,71450610,2016-04-25,29330627,Pranjul,"The apartment is very well located close to MIT and Harvard and was as described. Ellen was extremely helpful and accommodating to ensure that we managed to drop our bags early and pick them up late after our meetings in the afternoon. Definitely recommend the apartment and the host for business trips or family vacation. Thanks Ellen, we will definitely visit again."
7789055,71812429,2016-04-28,25601280,Dee,"This apartment was fantastic. Great space, quiet and lovely neighbourhood and Ellen made it not only easy but was kind enough to drop me off at a nearby clinic for an injury I had. I would stay here again for sure."
7789055,76442289,2016-05-27,8140795,Deena,Ellen was very responsive to our questions. Check in was fine. The neighborhood is great - its an excellent location and having a parking permit was crucial. The apartment was well appointed with what you need and comfortable beds. It is great to have central air as the temperature was close to 90 degrees. The shower was very good and it is nice to have laundry even though we didn't use the machines. It was pretty clean. Its rented out constantly and would benefit from a deeper cleaning.
7789055,78121843,2016-06-05,19738219,Carol,"Ellen was very sweet and accommodating. When I thought we might have an extra guest for 2 or 3 nights, she kindly offered a mattress topper if we needed an extra bed.   The neighborhood was safe and close to MIT's campus.  The apartment was clean and had everything we needed.  The parking pass was great.  It allowed us to leave the car at the apartment all day & just take Uber wherever we had to go.  I would recommend Ellen's place to anyone needing a temporary home in Cambridge."
7789055,80518700,2016-06-18,64535586,Sara Jane,The location was great and the hosts instructions were very good. We had no issues getting on the WiFi.
"The house needs some major repairs and the host was informed of these issues upon arrival. The ac was leaking. It is mounted over the bathroom door and caused the wood to warp so you could not close the bathroom door at all. It was also starting to warp the floors too. The doors all creaked loudly and the light over the stove did not work. There is no TV. There is also a strange door blocked by a dresser.\"",,,,,

Ellen did manage to efficiently organize alternate accommodation at a South Boston location. The South Boston apartment was very clean, tidy, close to shops and T station.   Perfect size for large groups and bonus parking is right out front!"
7789055,90246618,2016-07-31,66188266,Ken,Everything from start to finish was just as we expected. From the easy parking right in front of the building to the tons of space inside the apartment. Ellen was quick to respond to any questions that we had. I would absolutely stay there again. Thanks!
8792552,54145844,2015-11-16,37616479,Diego,"I don't know if the owner changed to post in Airbnb but I didn't know that it was a one bathroom. If I knew this in the first place I wouldn't have considered this property. So I think it was a bit misleading. The whole process from the very beginning was not that friendly (I continuously asked for extra pictures and never got a proper response). When arrived at Boston the owner sent the property manager to negotiate, he was never available (manager told me that owner was in the hospital) Overall, the flat was clean and tidy, very well located."
8792552,54560488,2015-11-21,27637332,Nate,Simple clean central and convenient. I met up with friends in Boston. Elkins place was perfect for a quick overnight. He was very receptive and accommodating. Would recommend to a friend.
8792552,55309665,2015-11-29,35146523,Philip,I had a wonderful experience with this rental. The host was extremely responsive and helpful in the lead-up to my stay and the key transfer was seamless.

"The only gripes I have are that the Internet was out during my stay although this was fixed within a day and the agreed upon \"\"flexible check in\"\" time we had agreed upon was not fulfilled as Elkin did not respond to my message to give me details on how to get into the apartment (agreed upon check in time was early morning on the 8th which he agreed to).",,,,,

8792552,60856532,2016-01-28,48421643,Justin,"We loved the place. It was great to have a spot in downtown Boston that really gave a sense of what it would be like to live there. Walking distance to so. much. stuff. And it really isn't hard to get to off the highway. But the place itself was very clean, very well kept. It felt like a little apartment just waiting for us. Essentials like towels were provided, very clean and very nice. There is a TV in the living room area we were able to hook up a laptop to easily and watch Netflix after returning from some pubs. The bathroom is quite nice, the shower works great. The bedrooms (2) were fantastic, you can't get that in a hotel for a price like this. There are 2 (big) mattress beds + 1 air mattress (in the closet)."
Most importantly,Elkin was great to work with. He gave me instructions on how to get in right after booking,and was always quick to respond with any questions I had. This was my first Airbnb experience,"and it was really great! Thanks Elkin!\"",,
8792552,61455165,2016-02-04,42227286,Tash,Elkin was very quick to respond on the Airbnb site.
We gave him an ETA before we left for Boston via Airbnb messaging. When we text and called him on the cell number listed to keep him informed of our updated ETA,we got no response because the number listed on his profile was not current. We then had to incur roaming fees to log into Airbnb to contact him via that to find out where to get the keys (something that we could have been told prior to our departure).,,,,
We had to ask for bedding to make up the additional bed at 9pm on our night of arrival and was told it would take one hour to arrive - it took two and it was only a top and bottom sheet - no duvet or comforter.,,,,,
The location of the apartment was excellent for exploring the city on foot but is by no means a 'modern' apartment.,,,,,
It is noisy,but that is to be expected in a bustling downtown area.,,,,
Despite having to ask Elkin via Airbnb messaging after our arrival for the keys,the internet/wifi details and the extra bedding,"he was always prompt to reply and polite.\"",,,

I recommend Elkin's apartment!"
8792552,63369539,2016-02-22,55347063,Kimberly,"The location is great, as described in the listing. There are many places to get to either by foot, the T or taxi/Uber. The building is nice and feels secure. Elkin was pleasant to correspond with, but never personally met him during our stay. Fairly quick on most replies. The bedrooms were nice size with decent living room/kitchen. The listing states 4 beds, which 2 are actually beds, one would be an air mattress and the fourth I am guessing he means the couch. Adequate closet and dresser space if needed. The listing overall seemed clean, however, the previous renter met us upon arrival as his luggage was still in the room, so not sure there was time for a cleaning between stays. Only real evidence of this was a used towel in the closet and a left over sock under the couch. As listed essentials are provided, however, a few extra pillows, blankets would be a nice added value. Especially if someone is planning to use the couch and air mattress for extra sleeping, we didn't see any extra sheets, pillows, or blankets for these.  We didn't get any house rules or details for things like accessing the internet or where to dispose of our garbage, and specifics on check out. Elkin was quick to reply on the internet access, but slower on the 2 other questions.  Overall satisfied with our stay and the listing. Would consider working with Elkin again if our trips bring us back to the area. Thank you Elkin for nice accommodations during our stay."

8792552,65822595,2016-03-17,23649909,Tina,"Communicating with the owner was a bit difficult because I had to ask how to check-in a couple of days before the trip rather than him telling me first. The response was relatively slow. I originally asked to book a different home that he owned and it actually expired with no response. However, he responded after it expired offering me this location which was nice. We left at 4AM and that was when I realized I was not given a check-out procedure. I messaged him but of course I did not expect a response since it was so early. So I just left the keys where I found them. There were no instructions to the wifi but we figured it out by just taking the tiny information off the side of router."
The apartment,however,"was a great location and very nice for the amount of people we had. Very central and a short walk to everything and transportation.\"",,,
8792552,66784130,2016-03-24,39772127,Penny,it is a good experience. The location is very convenient.
8792552,68081364,2016-04-02,7805734,Anne-Lise,"One big problem was that the bedding what's dirty with hair, smudges and a used bandaid. There where no sheets. The fifth bed was non existent. Location was good even though there are many homeless people on the street. Check in and out was easy."
8792552,71856319,2016-04-29,8128156,Elvis,"Great host, clean and tidy apartment, great location near Chinatown and subway station."
"Thank you for letting us stay at your place.\"",,,,,
8792552,73477441,2016-05-08,25509216,Barbara,"Die Unterkunft liegt sehr günstig (5-10 min vom Boston Common entfernt), die U-Bahn ist auch in der Nähe."
Für 4 Personen ist das Appartment gut ausreichend,allerdings ist es für 7 ausgeschrieben. Im Wohnzimmer gibt es noch eine Couch und eine Luftmatraze für zwei. Es gibt allerdings sind am Tisch nur 2 Stühle,das Geschirr reicht nicht für 7 Personen.,,,
Laken und Tücher konnten wir anfangs nicht finden. Nach mehreren Kontakten mit Elkin (die sich schwierig gestalteten,wir fragen uns ob er Englisch verstand) fanden wir die Laken unter!! einem Sessel in einem Reißverschlussfach. Sie waren auch etwas knapp bemessen (so dass wir uns mit Handtüchern zudecken mussten). Sauber war alles,nachdem wir uns endlich verständigen konnten,"klappte auch alles. \"",,
8792552,74158302,2016-05-13,11146515,Pedro,"La mejor ubicación ! Todo cerca. Apartamento muy cómodo. Si tuviera cubiertos y microondas sería genial. No tuvimos el gusto de conocer a Elkin, pero todo funcionó perfecto y cuando lo necesitamos contactar, respondió rápida y efectivamente. Muchas gracias Elkin. Te recomendaremos."
8792552,75036447,2016-05-18,4634767,Luc,"It wasn't too easy to find the apartment for parking and traffic affected that. Elkin's instructions for getting into the apartment were clear and easy. Upon arrival there were a few hiccups here and there, such as the place being left a mess and lack of toilet paper after the last guest. But that was shortly taken care of by Elkin for the cleaning tenant was running late."
Because it was only a one night stay,it was manageable overall. Nothing too spectacular,"but it was okay. Thanks again for the stay.\"",,,
8792552,75220021,2016-05-19,61320645,David,Great location! Close to pretty much everything.
8792552,75401104,2016-05-21,55044762,Danae,Host is hard to reach and the neighborhood was a tad sketchy for my taste. Had to call the cops at 4AM with a noise complaint from a loud parking lot party outside of the window.
8792552,76352177,2016-05-26,25151382,Divyesh,"The house was perfect for me and my family. Everything was clean, tidy. Neighborhood is 5 min walk from Boston South Station, stone throw away from 24 hour CVS/Walgreens Pharmacy. All places of interest are within 20-25 minutes walking distance, or effortless drive. Chinatown orange line subway is one block away."
House had all the required good quality essentials,"and is perfect for a group or family visit to Boston. Elkin was prompt in answering any queries.\"",,,,
8792552,77151605,2016-05-30,26749011,Rebecca,"The location of this apartment was great.  There was plenty within walking distance - food, convenience stores, other neighborhoods.  Upon requesting the apartment, Elkin was quick to respond and very accommodating since the apartment I requested was actually booked so he offered us this one instead."
My group did not receive any check-in/check-out instructions.  When the first of my party arrived,she contacted him and he gave instructions on how to get key.  But,she did have to wait for someone to come out of the door so she could go in..not sure if she got lucky or what,but that could have been inconvenient if no one was there to open the outside doors.  Upon check out we put the keys back where we found them because we were not told otherwise.,,
My group felt very much so that the kitchen was a tease.  There was just enough that it was mainly functional but missing a lot of key things (oil,salt,pepper,cooking utensils,baking tray).  There were cups,plates and silverware
We also ran into an issue with the bathroom ceiling leaking.  After being there the first night we noticed the ceiling was leaking in the bathroom.  On the next morning I texted to let him know but did not get a response.  When we arrived back later that day the entire ceiling tile had caved in (ruining a few of our toiletries) and causing for a hard time using the restroom.  I tried calling and texting and did not get a response and was told the number got disconnected.  I then used the messaging feature in AirBnB and get a response.  All together,it took about an hour once he responded and someone was here to clean up and about another hour until someone came to actually fix the issue.  Although,it unfortunately did not get fixed.  We discovered this was all related to the air conditioner being turned on,and with it being nearly 90 degrees out,it was necessary to have the AC on.,
All in all,"the apartment was exactly how it appeared in the photos.  If the kitchen had just a few more things and we didn't have the leaky ceiling snafu this would have been a great stay.\"",,,,
8792552,78162943,2016-06-05,53354419,Adonis,Great place as advertised.  Super clean inside.  The oven was great for warming food.  Being in the middle of Boston downtown made walking to all the tourist attractions a breeze.
8792552,78981728,2016-06-10,4621691,David,"The best things about this place are the location and Elkin's communication.  We loved being in the Chinatown neighborhood and being able to walk to Boston Common park.  The street had enough activity to feel safe, but not so much activity that it was too loud to sleep.  It's close to the train and some Freedom Trail sites too, which was perfect for us.  Also, Elkin was always quick to respond to my messages and he made the check-in/check-out process super easy."
However,"the place itself was pretty bare bones.  The cleanliness could be better (like cleaning the carpets) and a little additional decor could go a long way to making it feel more \"\"home-y.\"\"  We stayed here two separate nights",ten days apart.  When we arrived for the second night,the towels in the bathroom were wet (seemed like maintenance had used them to clean up water from a ceiling leak).,,
But overall,it was a good stay.  If you want to be near downtown in a fun neighborhood without paying crazy Boston hotel prices,"I'd recommend this place.\"",,,
8792552,79506393,2016-06-13,9305110,Jose Luis,"Not a good experience due to the apartment not having essentials (bed linens, covers, sheets) contrary to what was listed on the page. When we arrived there were no towels; the host delivered these at 9pm, one towel was missing. The apartment is in a good location, China Town, as it is close to everything. Could be great with a more dedicated host/service. We did not appreciate that we were not informed the essentials will never arrive to the apartment, instead we spent the entire day messaging with the host for nothing."
8792552,81933224,2016-06-25,64828728,Hector,We were very pleased with the location of the apartment because we were able to walk everywhere and had the subway station very close.
"We had two pharmacies and restaurants very close . Elkin responded to our requests promptly. We were disappointed with the condition of the carpeting in the living and dining room area. It had stains everywhere. \"",,,,,

8792552,90556723,2016-08-01,64118409,Ivan,"Our group of five had a very pleasant stay at Elkin's place. The place was neat, well-stocked with the necessary amenities (bed sheets and towels), and we were able to fit rather comfortably (between two beds for two, one air mattress that fits two, and a sofa that fits one- note that it is not a sofa bed- 6 people fit easily and 7 may be a bit tight but doable). The place's most appealing factor is its very convenient location in Boston's Chinatown, which is walking distance from many of the city's main sites. Elkin was a bit hard to reach prior to the stay, but I was able to reach him the day before our stay and from that point on he was very responsive. Based on our experience, I would recommend Elkin's as a place to stay while in Boston, specifically because of its great location."
8792552,91202518,2016-08-04,87391914,Francis,"Not a bad stay, location was decent but in china town. The host replied instantly and was friendly! Had a good night stay overall"

8792552,94044361,2016-08-14,60281149,Brett,"There were 7 of us.  We arrived by train hours before check in time but Our host allowed us to store our luggage at Apartment before it was cleaned and we were allowed to do some sight seeing without hauling everything with us.  The Apartment is small but with an air mattress and sofa we all slept comfortably.  There was no wi-fi and satalite tv didn't pick up any channels.  Apartment was very clean and is easily within walking distance to many areas.  We stayed for 2 days and had a great time.  Check out is at 11:00am.  Our train did not leave til  5 pm.  We were not able to extend checkout as the apartment was being cleaned at 11 so we were burdoned with luggage while walking around the city for 5 hours.  Not blaming the host for this, just bad planning on our part.  Would definately stay again."
8792552,95649064,2016-08-20,66800070,Leah,"The location of this apartment is amazing. It is within walking distance of downtown crossing and Chinatown. The place could have been much cleaner though. The sheets were full of hair and had been clearly used and not washed. The kitchen had dirty utensils and the carpet was stained and not vacuumed. However, there were the correct number of beds and linens, although I'm not sure the towels had been washed. Overall it was a relatively pleasant stay, but the owner was hard to communicate with before we got there. There were no move out instructions so I put the keys back where we got them."

This North End/Waterfront location couldn't have been more perfect. We walked to everything including the yummiest lobster roll we have ever had at Neptune on Salem St. My son & daughter loved the New England Aquarium."
The apartment was very spacious and far exceeded our expectation. The beds were amazing and the furniture was just right for relaxing after a long work day. I would love you to come decorate my house!,,,,,
The kitchen and bath had everything we could have wanted and were immaculate as was the rest of the apartment. Jason was just as amazing as the first time and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Can't wait to come back to Boston and have Jason be our host once again.,,,,,

Excellent location to several restaurants that we loved including Neptune Oyster Bar, Giacomo Ristorante and desserts at Mike's Pastry! North end was a fantastic neighborhood. The place was exceptionally clean and had all the amenities that we needed. We also had access to the rooftop which was seldom used during our trip simply because it was too cold to have any festivities outdoors but I imagine it would be awesome during the summer months. Will definitely rent from Jason again whenever we are in Boston."

The wifi and tv weren't working when I got there, but a quick text message to Jason and he was on the phone with the provider. Both rooms are good size and have closets. Bathroom is stocked with towels, soaps, and toiletries. A professional experience."

The apartment provides a great view of the  USS Constitution and Charlestown Navy Yard along with a roof deck to observe the surrounding areas. My family enjoyed our stay so much we inquired Jason about extending our stay an extra night and he was amenable to our request. Arrival and departure went smooth with his detailed instructions that covered the household items such as wifi-connectivity.

We couldn't find any decent cutting knives in the kitchen and he showed up the next day with a brand new set of knives and other supplies.  He also responded well to restaurant requests.  The information packet provided after booking was extremely helpful.  Must visits are Bova's bakery, Parziale's bakery, and Giacomo's Ristorante.  Don't forget to swing by Polcari's Coffee to take home some of the best whole beans you can get anywhere.  The kitchen leaves a little to be desired in terms of dishes, pots, & pans, but maybe we just cook more than the average guest."

Across the street was a wonderful athletic field and playground area,great with two young children (6 and 1) as we just had to walk out the door and they could run around the fenced in and safe area of the baseball fields,or the playground - all directly on the beautiful waterfront.,,,
The apartment was spacious enough for 4 adults and the two young children without feeling like we were on top of one another. Having the kitchen,and every other amenity made it comfortable for all - particularly the children as they had room to play and move about.,,,,

8458210,86433817,2016-07-16,10363033,Jessica,This was a well managed listing in Boston's North End - while a bit on the outskirts of the North End we still had easy access to all it had to offer.
8458210,87547940,2016-07-20,54895764,Amy,We loved the North End apartment for our family of 5.  The location was great and the apartment amenities are just as described.  We felt like real residents of Boston!  Jason was very easy to work with and we would love to stay at any of his properties in the future.
8458210,88433042,2016-07-24,80065294,Christina,"Our family of six (four adults and two children under 10), were excited and hesitant to try an AirBnB rental for the first time. Boy, did we hit the jackpot!"
From the very beginning,the owner was completely on point. He responded quickly to inquiries,was extremely friendly and incredibly accommodating. Checking in was a breeze and he even included attachments with directions to places,restaurant suggestions  and attractions to go see. Very helpful.,,
The apartment is AMAZING! Immaculately maintained and well decorated,with all that you need and more. We sincerely appreciated the attention to detail (nice soft sheets,k-cups for the kurig,the homey decorations,hair dryer,plenty of big blankets). The beds were comfortable
Super high marks for the location...close to the North Station,24 hour 711 right down the street,a free water sprinkler park directly across the street (perfect for the 100 degree heat),parking garage a couple of blocks away (32 bucks for 24 hours),the North End and all it has to offer is RIGHT outside your door.,
We can't wait to call Jason again and book a longer stay!! He was amazing,"the apartment was amazing and we are so thankful that we had such an incredibly positive experience! \"",,,,
8458210,89739974,2016-07-29,12704178,Katja,"Jasons apartment is beautiful, just as described. The rooms are very quiet and the beds are so comfortable. Plenty of linen, towels, tissues and soaps were provided. The kitchen was very well stocked and new. Everything was perfect clean. Jason was a perfect host. He was very attentive and friendly and checking in couldn`t have been easier with a lockbox in the entrance of the building. Jason provided us with lots of information about the building and the neighbourhood, so we had no questions left. Our family had a perfect stay in this beautiful part of Boston. Tons of Italian restaurants and everything easy to walk. I can highly recommend Jason`s apartment and I would definitely come back and stay there."
8458210,89900164,2016-07-30,74675874,Eric,The apartment in the North End lived up to all of our expectations.  Everything was set up as promised by Jason and the location was perfect.  Great access to the North End and its fantastic restaurants.  Next time we are in Boston we will definitely look to secure Jason's place again.  Thanks!
8458210,91698047,2016-08-06,54055732,Muireann,Jason was a fabulous host. Check in worked like clock work and Jason contacted us shortly after our arrival to make sure we had arrived safely. We had one very minor issue which Jason resolved within an hour of us notifying him which was above and beyond!
The apartment is in a fabulous location. We used it as a base to explore the city with our two children (3 and 19 months) and it worked brilliantly. We even got to watch an under 16s baseball match just across the road!,,,,,
"We would definitely stay in this apartment again.\"",,,,,
8458210,92512135,2016-08-08,48083689,Mary Kate,Our host was very thorough with the description of the check in and check out process and provided us with a lot of useful knowledge about the neighborhood and other attractions to see around the city.
The space itself exceeded our expectations and was very modern and roomy for 6 people to stay. We had everything we needed.,,,,,
The neighborhood was great! So many amazing restaurants nearby and right around the corner from a lot of great historical sights.,,,,,
"I would definitely recommend staying at this location.\"",,,,,
8458210,92668408,2016-08-09,16438123,Bradley,Great neighborhood and an excellent property.  One of the best in Boston.
8458210,93632152,2016-08-13,11039429,Dominique,Communication parfaite à notre hôte ! Tout était en ordre pour notre arrivée ! L'appartement est bien situé. La terrasse n'est pas adjacente à l'appartement contrairement à ce que les photos peuvent suggérer.
Pour le reste c'est nickel,"on recommande !\"",,,,
8458210,93978985,2016-08-14,9838819,Aakash,Place was great. Jason was great.
8458210,95306992,2016-08-19,53815102,Guido,"Jason is a superhost. He contacted us promptly, gave us a perfect welcome mail with all the necessary informations. The apartment was just as described."
"It was our first Airbnb and we were absolutely happy with our choice. The location was perfect to discover North End as well as the rest of Boston. We also liked the pool on the other side of the street. Jason gave us a several ideas of places to go and we liked his visit thus we could speak to our host in person. We would definitely book the apartment again. \"",,,,,
2429961,13603103,2014-06-01,11922955,Bethany,"Overall - a great stay in a convenient location. Don't get much more central than this in Boston and though the price is high, it is well priced for the neighborhood. The size was perfect for having a bit of privacy while hosting guests. The condition was good enough - not super modern/new, but clean and functional. It is three steep flights up - ok for us but not for all.  All the amenities were well stocked.  Elyne was as available as we needed, which was not much at all during the month. We will definitely stay again in the future."
2429961,30288248,2015-04-20,27213518,Antonieta,muy bueno el sitio y la anfitriona esta muy pendiente de atender tus demanda
2429961,32331620,2015-05-17,29084496,Sindu,The area was beautiful and the apartment was really nice! So glad I chose this place. The location is so great. Everything is walkable from back bay.
2429961,35299942,2015-06-17,13028651,Neelima,"The communication was adequate.  Elyne was there to give us the keys, and there was a note to help us sign in for wifi and other helpful information.  She also responded quickly and put the air conditioning unit as it was going to be hot that weekend.  The unit is as shown in the pictures and as described.  The location of the unit is very nice, it is close to backbay's vibrant streets, lot of restaurants on Newbury street and Boylston.  It is very close to shopping areas in prudential plaza and Boylston street.  Close to Charles river for walks.  The apartment also has a roof deck which is exclusive for the unit and added to the enjoyment of the apartment.  It is close to Boston commons and there is a very pretty walking path that leads to it."
While the location is great,there are three flights of stairs to get to the apartment which can be challenging with the luggage and groceries.  The apartment is also old,as this area is pretty old. It is in need of some TLC.  The doors to the bedroom and bathroom does not close.  The deck on top is in dire need of repair,with some wood splintering and some railings that need some repairs.  The building has no laundry facility but there were laundry facilities with wash and fold option too.  We used Washio for laundry.,,
"Overall we had a very nice stay and would like to rent it again.\"",,,,,
2429961,47261649,2015-09-17,19989696,Marko,"The apartment was clean and tidy when we arrived. It is a bit out of date, but everything was working fine and we had no issues. The location of the apartment is great - the parks, the Charles river, shopping and restaurants are within short walking distance. All in all it is a fair deal considering the location."
2429961,67474810,2016-03-29,6800937,Simon,"Me and my wife stayed for two weeks in this apartment. The location is perfect (close to everything) and compared with other rentals in this area we paid a fair price. The apartment, including the kitchen, is very well equipped and we particularly liked the furniture (no chipboard ikea items or cheap plastic kitchenware). Everything was clean and the bed was a joy to sleep on. We were never bothered by any loud noise of the other tenants. The fact that we could connect our laptop to the stereo system to listen to music was convenient and the wifi worked throughout the two weeks without any problems."
These two things are noteworthy:,,,,,
1. The apartment is located on the third floor and only reachable by a quite narrow and steep staircase with no elevator. This was not an issue for us but could be for other people.,,,,,
2. Due to the fact that the heating can't be regulated and the apartment is on the top floor of the building,it becomes very hot during the winter. Even with the windows open and only wearing a t-shirt I was sweating inside on some days. The owner explained that this is due to the age of the building.,,,,
The owner is very helpful,friendly and highly responsive. We had a problem with a broken fan inside the fridge which after a few days began to almost constantly make a very loud noise and she promptly came by to find a solution.,,,,
In total,"we enjoyed our stay very much and can recommend this place.\"",,,,
2429961,68427974,2016-04-04,61255240,Alessandra,"The flat was beautiful and elegant as it looked in the pictures, the position in the city very comfortable and the host was helpful and kind. The only issue was that the router broke down and we had to ask our neighbour the password of his network in order to access the internet. The host came promptly to help us anyway, although it turned out it was not fixable and we had to use the neighbour's network the whole time. She guaranteed to provide a new router for the future though, so this one with the internet was just an unlucky and temporary issue which shouldn't discourage people from choosing this flat for their stay in Boston. Overall it was a very pleasant accomodation and a lovely holiday."
2429961,69484447,2016-04-11,59300611,Lauren,The apartment is just as pictured and was perfect for our quick trip to Boston.  The apartment sits in Back Bay and we would definitely recommend staying in this area regardless of paying a little extra.  This apartment was central to every neighborhood and only a 5-10 minute walk from the Green Line Copley station which was super convenient to get to farther locations.  Although the host was out of town during our trip she left clear instructions for accessing the apartment and we had no problems during our stay.
2429961,70971908,2016-04-22,59316374,Aaron,Great location. If you want to stay in the middle and heart of Boston this is the place.
2429961,71820661,2016-04-29,58022776,Sandy,The host canceled this reservation 93 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2429961,71963836,2016-04-30,63681328,Dominique,"The lodging is in line with the description. Geographic location is great in the heart of the city, the true asset of the apartment. Real  additional asset is the very nice terrace. Regarding welcoming, we did not see anyone at arrival as well as at departure. Our only issue was the wifi, that did not work, maybe due to our foreign equipment. We never solved it. And it worked in other locations in Boston and in Cape Cod."
2429961,73039188,2016-05-06,48063776,Mengyi,"It was a really great experience for us to stay in the apartment for three days. The apartment was very clean and quiet. The host was very helpful that she answered my questions in time! The location is so good ! It is near the Newbury street, and it takes us only 5-10 mins to walk to the subway. This block is awesome and beautiful! I love this apartment and wish to stay in this apartment next time if I come to Boston with my parents!"
2429961,76757754,2016-05-29,63701090,Alexander,"\"This place is amazing! I would definitely recommend it to almost anyone. The room literally has a deck (a roof) with a nice view and is very enjoyable (it is the best part of the apartment). As for the rest, you have everything you need, a nice bathroom, a nice place to sit down with friends and watch TV, a cool kitchen space with all the essentials and a nice bedroom with a comfy bed. However the only \"\"letdown\"\" was that the freezer was not functioning and I could therefore not keep ice cream or ice for any drinks at the apartment. Other than that everything was really great"
2429961,78559617,2016-06-07,7100033,James,We enjoyed our stay. The apartment was just as described. Our host was responsive to our questions and requests. Its location was perfect for our visit. it's close to the T and local restaurants.  We would sty there again!.
2429961,80036701,2016-06-15,5791916,Abbie,"Communication was really easy with Elyne. Check-in was simple and everything was in order when re arrived. The apartment is very close to Newbury Street and the Copley Square Green Line T stop. The stairs can pack a punch if you're not used to apartment living, but it's not too bad. Overall, a great AirBnB stay!"
2429961,81229586,2016-06-21,13215238,Lily,Great apartment in a fantastic location! Everything was as described. Would stay here again.

2014882,14541967,2014-06-21,16222527,Yuriko,My mom and I stayed at Yossi's parents' house in Boston. His parents are so sweet and so welcoming. They did not bother us too much either but very helpful giving needed items and serving breakfasts. We've got our private bath in the room which was super nice too.
The location wasn't too bad 5-10min walk to the subway station which is the end of Green Boston College line. Overall,"my mom was happy about the stay :) \"",,,,
2014882,14671586,2014-06-23,16964583,Laramie,a wonderful experience! The Rosenbergs couldn't have been nicer hosts. A quiet street and airy pleasant rooms. Convenient to everything in Brighton. We will definitely book again the next time visiting family up that way!

Everything from hygienics to first aid was supplied, along with complementary drinks! They are very friendly and make you feel safe and at home in a large and busy city. As a first time user of airbnb, I'd highly recommend their service they provided, for they truly have set the bar for me"

We had a private room upstairs complete with a small refrigerator and bottled water for our excursions.  Breakfast was completely at our convenience. Mrs. Rosenberg sat out a complete meal including bagels, spread, juice, fruit and cereal.  We had a key to come and go at our leisure.  Thank you so much!!"

The house was beautiful, in a very convenient location in the city. That was near Harvard Sq, a short drive to Boston, and the neighborhood was good as well."
I met briefly with Mr. and Mrs. Rosenberg and enjoyed both of them.,,,,,
"I would return any time I need to be there. \"",,,,,
2014882,17688965,2014-08-16,17080174,Amir,This is a great place to stay!
We spent 8 nights at the Rosenbergs,and had a very good experience.,,,,
The rooms were cosy and with a lot of space. They are located on the upper floor of the house so you have your privacy during the stay.,,,,,
Mrs. Rosenberg took care of everything! She was more than just helpful and we felt like old friends or family members. She treated us more than just a host.,,,,,
The unit includes 2 rooms,one of them with private shower and toilets. In between,there's a small living room where you can have a breakfast,which was actually supplied by the host!,,
If you have children- this is a very good place for you! The Rosenbergs have everything you need,including toys!,,,,
The location is good enough- just few minutes walk from the T train.,,,,,
Few things you should know,which are not a badfeedback but just an info:,,,,
The rooms are on the upper floor,so if you have any difficulties,you should care about this.,,,
There is no double bad- so if you are a couple and care about it,you should be aware.,,,,
For us,it was not a big deal and we did not feel it as a disadvantage.,,,,
The bottom line- if we will return to Boston again,we would probably stay at the same place.,,,,

They had milk in the fridge for me and the simple breakfast cereals.  If you are looking for a fancy place, this is not what you will find.  What you find is simple, quiet, and a good place to sleep."

2014882,27358710,2015-03-02,26504102,Katie,"This location is ideal. It is set back from busy streets but easily walkable to public transportation. The room was great with enough space for me and my friend. There was cereal and milk and a private bathroom. We felt so welcomed. The bedrooms, bathroom and small kitchen area are on the second floor so we had our own space. There wasn't any sharing of space which was nice to have privacy. I will definitely stay again."

Arkadaşımla birlikte bir hafta misafir olduğumuz tertemiz bir ev. Ev sahibi bizi gayet sıcak karşıladı. Ev sahibi rahat etmemiz için elinden geleni yaptı. Özellikle belirtmek istiyorum,"ev çok temiz. Hatta evden ayrıldığımız gün ev sahibi bizi gideceğimiz yere kadar arabasıyla bıraktı. Çok memnun kaldık. \"",,,,

It's a lovely house. We used different door to get in and out which I think was so convenient. The rooms were well cleaned and cute. And thanks for the breakfast and snacks. It's also located in a safe neighborhood with short distance to B line. Highly recommended."

2014882,33947205,2015-06-02,33641881,Constance,We spent two nights in Yossi's Brighton home and it was a really good experience. Mr. and Mrs. Rosenberg were very friendly and welcoming. Everything was as it had been described -- clean and comfortable. I liked having a corner room with big windows. It's a nice neighborhood and was quiet enough to have the windows open. I felt safe in the neighborhood--Brighton has a smaller town feeling despite being in Boston's Metro area. I will definitely come here again.

We arrived home late each evening and left early in the morning so we never saw them after checking in. We did not partake of the cereal left out for us but we did appreciate the bottled water we were given. The nice neighborhood location was a 10 minute walk to the bus for a 15-20 minute ride into Boston. A surprise arrived one morning after my husband came back from his run and found a wild turkey in the front yard! It sure has a \"\"Country feel!\"\"\""
2014882,39032824,2015-07-20,35584971,Guo,Yossi's dad is very nice and friendly. the place is quite closed to Boston college. Everything is clean and organized. It was a good stay!

2014882,40756987,2015-08-02,35792345,Sophie,Nous avons reçu un bon accueil de Mme Rossenberg. Le logement était très agréable. Parfait pour une famille. Idéal si vous êtes en voiture sinon il faut compter environ 45 minutes pour rejoindre le centre de Boston en transport en commun.

There are cereals and other food for breakfast. The neighborhood is quiet and iwith the public transportation it is easy to go to Boston Downtown,  Harvard and to the Beach. I recommend this accommodation."

2014882,44775884,2015-08-29,3372183,Cindy,"Yossi always reply promptly. When I told him we were heading to his house, he sent transportation guide immediately.  I booked Yossi's house for my friend who visited Boston from China. Yossi's father received us with nice and patient introductions. The house is spacious and beautiful inside and outside. The room was clean and private. The bed was very comfortable and my friend had good sleep on it. They even use different doors for guests and themselves. The environment is like a cottage, which is surrounded by big trees, quiet with shades.  We cannot believe it is not far from the noisy streets. Bus stop is very close and T is walking distance as well. My friend fell in love with the house immediately. She said she will live in this house for her every visit in the future.  My friend met Yossi's mother when she checked out. Yossi's family showed that they care and respect guests. My friend said her total experience is like at own home. She enjoyed it very much. Thanks to Yossi's family for providing such a nice place with reasonable price."
2014882,45467865,2015-09-03,2222972,Jb,We have a terrific stay at Yossi's parents. The house is very comfortable and quiet. We were in the midst of moving in and Yossi's mother has been very accommodating in letting us use her porch to store our stuff temporarily.
"Highly recommended hosts! \"",,,,,
2014882,45805343,2015-09-06,37947273,Valerie,This is a lovely old house in an amazingly quiet neighborhood considering how close it is to the main road and public transportation.  Mrs. Rosenberg welcome us and showed us to a very nice corner bedroom upstairs with a private bathroom.  It was clean and roomy enough for two people.  The beds were comfortable and an air conditioning unit was provided for the warmer nights.  There are snacks and cereal set out for breakfast.  Parking was available on the street which is a real advantage in an area where parking is at a premium.  We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.

The bedroom was exactly as the description, all clean and nice. The house is close of trem, and by car it takes 15/20 minutes to Boston downtown. I totally recommend his place, I would definitely stay there again."
2014882,46515379,2015-09-11,25746041,Louw,"The description was accurate and the host was there to accommodate. A kind lady she was. The neighborhood is a bit far out of Boston's center, but not that it was a problem as transport was easily available. The WiFi was also good."

2014882,48315574,2015-09-25,4128144,Mick,"Yossi's father and mother made us very welcome. A lovely pair. The situation was gorgeous, a lovely house and a superb position with a small wood over the road and good transport links to Harvard and the city centre. One small point is that the location of the property on the (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) map is not correct; it is a couple of streets away."
2014882,48875089,2015-09-29,13603876,Beth,"Overall, my stay with the Rosenbergs was fabulous!  My room and bathroom were very clean and as described.

Really nice plus on top of all the amenities: bathroom with extras (toothbrushes etc) and a mini-breakfast nook with goodies set out, super nice.  Definitely a quiet country-ish neighborhood but only a few blocks from some cool restaurants/shops/etc."

The place is nice and comfortable, you even get complimentary breakfast.  Slightly away from the city center but the train stop near by is safe, the journey to town takes approximately 50 minutes.

A lovely older woman who made me feel extremely welcome and made sure I had everything that I needed/wanted. It is a very large house and you get an entire wing to yourself. I never saw or heard them while I was there. They also leave milk, cereal and other awesome snacks for you to enjoy which was super helpful. It is a nice clean room with its own bathroom. It is a quick walk to a nice center of town and very easily connects you into Boston. A super cheap Uber or public transportation will get you into downtown Boston very quickly. I walked to Kenmore and it was a very enjoyable walk. I would highly recommend the room/wing. Thank you Yossi and fam!!"

2014882,51734079,2015-10-24,43840608,Carmen,A very nice experience. It was our first Airbnb reservation and it could not be better. The room was perfect.
2014882,52038509,2015-10-26,28698365,Nanny,"DE verhuurder (moeder van Yossi) Heeft ons onze ruimte getoond.  We beschikten over twee kamers, een badkamer en een tussenruimte waar we cornflakes en warme drank konden nemen.  Buiten het welkom is er geen enkel ander contact geweest. Jammer.  Het was geweldig dat we over een eigen gedeelte van het huis konden beschikken.  Nochthans lagen er in die kamers allerlei spullen van de bewoners.  We mochten een kast gebruiken maar daar hingen nog kleren van de bewoners in.  Dit vonden we een beetje raar.  De bedden waren heel goed en de kamer was groot."
Het meest jammer vonden we de badkamer.  Die was helemaal niet proper.  Overal lagen haren van de bewoners.  Zeer jammer.,,,,,
"Misschien is het toch beter van dan maar 1 kamer ter beschikking te stellen voor verhuurders maar die dan ook volledig ten dienste stellen voor de verhuurders.  In beide kamers lagen heel wat spullen van de eigenaars.  \"",,,,,
2014882,52869375,2015-11-02,17106185,Brennan,The neighbourhood is exactly as described. Beautiful with a country feel. Very nice hosts who were very accommodating - we really enjoyed ourselves. The beds were not full queen-sized (for anyone travelling from Canada) but they were big enough for two big guys. Would definitely stay here again and recommend doing so for anyone considering.
"Thanks Yossi and Sam!\"",,,,,

Me and my family stayed for four days. The rooms, located on a separate and private floor, were cozy and clean, and the light breakfast offered was a very welcome plus; the host ensured that everything was fine for us.

The little details in the home were really appreciated. They even have some toys and a small bed, if you are travelling with a small child (as we were) those little things add up. The hosts were very warm and accommodating- even giving us an extra key after I locked myself out by splitting up. I really loved seeing the family pictures, really made it feel like a home.

The rooms are super clean, and the beds are comfy. The \"\"kitchen\"\" was fine for us since we only ate breakfast at home and didn't require any cooking."
The biggest drawback was that the bathroom is located within one of the two bedrooms,so people who live in that bedroom don't have much privacy. There was a sliding screen that tried to separate the sleeping area from the passage to the bathroom,but unfortunately the screen was broken,so we had to hang a bedding sheet up to visually separate the spaces.,,
Otherwise,everything was pretty good. The check-in was smooth despite our late arrival. We figured out the parking space ourselves,with the assistance of a friendly neighbor. The area is quiet and safe at night,"and there is a beautiful reservoir nearby and is good for morning joggers. \"",,

2014882,95375196,2016-08-19,73157617,Kenny,"We did not meet the host during our stay, but he did leave us with concise instructions for obtaining access to the house. His mother, who stays in the house, is very gracious and made us feel right at home during the time we were there. The house is very clean and the common 'pantry' area in the hallway is very convenient. It is well stocked with various cereals, a refrigerator with fresh milk, an electric kettle, and a microwave."
The area in which the house is located in is quiet,and is relatively safe at night. If you're lucky and happen to book the house when there're no other guests,definitely opt for the room with the bathroom as it makes it a little easier to get to at night and in the mornings,if you wish to lock the door to your room. The air conditioner is a window casement type that is a little noisy when it rattles on its mount,but given Boston's great weather,chances are all you'll need is the ceiling fan.

8518237,50123253,2015-10-09,1637656,Grace,Gorgeous flat with a truly luxurious feel. In spite of being lower-level it was incredibly quiet and had high ceilings. Large windows face the garden-patio in the back. I enjoyed cooking in the amazing kitchen. The bathroom/double shower was also exceptional. Wonderfully helpful hosts. I look forward to returning!
8518237,50223679,2015-10-10,45287288,Brianna,The apartment is exactly as you see in the photos. Well decorated and maintained. James and Pierre made it so easy to get comfortable and even left delicious chocolates on our pillows.  This would be a spot I would love to stay again when visiting Boston.  The area the apartment is located is quiet and residential. Shops were near buy to pick up anything you may have forgotten.  James and Pierre was quick with all responses and genuinely happy to help with any questions to make this a perfect stay.

There are even LINDT chocolates on the pillow's upon your arrival! Honestly, we did not want to leave. Parking spot and easy drive into Boston. We also used Uber. We haven't stopped raving about the accommodations and will definitely be back!"
8518237,53728135,2015-11-11,101929,Nathaniel,House was emasculate. Absolutely a fantastic space. If you need to stay near BC stay here!

8518237,54655388,2015-11-22,19865093,Jocelyn,"Our stay at the Garden Apartment was a fantastic experience, this was our first time using air bnb Peirre was an amazing host. My partner and I were just taking a weekend away and enjoyed this space! Everything is beautifully done, and very comfortable.  The neighborhood was great, surrounded by one of the colleges however super quiet and welcoming. We were able to enjoy a couple local restaurants that Peirre suggested! Our evening walk around the area was very nice in the crisp fall air.  El Pelon and Devlins were great local places, probably the best Taco we have had in a long time!  We used Uber to travel into downtown, which was also super easy! There is so much this area has to offer, and we look forward to booking for another weekend in the future!  This space was wonderful and truly hard to leave. The kitchen has everything you need and a great cup of coffee!  We loved the seltzer in the fridge door!"
8518237,59434371,2016-01-10,29916537,Blair,"Our 4-night stay at the Boston Garden was wonderful! The unit is beautifully decorated with modern, high-end appliances and fixtures. It is extremely clean and very comfortable, particularly the bed. James  quickly responded to the few questions we had about the unit and also was kind enough to provide a recommendations for local restaurants. The biggest plus: a free parking space! If you've stayed in the Cambridge area, you know parking is at a premium. I will stay again with James and Pierre if I return the Cambridge area."

Just a few minutes walk away from Boston College (the reason why we visited) and the T stop that leads downtown. For those looking for a luxurious stay in a laid-back neighbourhood,"this is the place to stay. Will definitely consider this place again! Love it!\"",,,,

It also comes with a parking spot,which if you are familiar with Boston,you know is basically impossible to find. Even hotels charge extra fees for parking. I almost wanted to cancel plans so I could sit on the couch in the sun with a cup of coffee (the Nespresso machine is amazing)! The T is literally right up the street,extremely accessible for tourists looking to stay in a quieter area but have complete access to the city. James and Pierre are fantastic hosts,"answered my messages/texts right away making sure we had everything we need to make our stay as perfect as it could be. We will absolutely be staying in this apartment whenever we come to Boston in the future! \"",

All questions were answered very promptly and they went out of their way to help accommodate to an early check in and check out.  The apartment was like new, updated with the best modern appliances and style with a cozy - home type feel to it.  Whenever in Boston I'll surly be staying with them again."

The house is very close to Boston College and the train station so the transportation is very convenient. The decoration was so nice that it makes me feel like home. The kitchen and the bathroom are well equipped. The wifi in the room is fast. We had a really great time here and we will definitely book the house again if we are going to visit Boston again.
8518237,66105911,2016-03-19,29860099,Shana,"James and Pierre were amazing hosts! Everything we could possibly need or want was taken care of.

The location was perfect... very close to restaurants and the city. The home was modern and impeccably clean. And, the hosts were very informative before arrival and responsive to any questions and/or comments we had during our stay."
For my husband and I traveling with our infant son,this was truly a home away from home. We felt very welcomed even before our arrival and the apartment was perfect for the three of us... not to mention that parking was available and on location! We'd recommend this space ten times over for anyone looking to stay in the Boston area. And,"we'll definitely be looking to stay here again for any future trips planned!\"",,,

The neighborhood is convenient to everything and  I walked everywhere and never felt unsafe for a minute!!  James and Pierre are the perfect hosts and responded promptly to any questions I had!  The windows and doors are all a gorgeous clean European design and the entire place feels like an apartment in Paris!  It was absolutely the BEST Airbnb I've stayed at and I would highly recommend their beautiful apartment, even to my most discerning friends!   The apartment was really incredible andas hosts, they were equally welcoming and made me feel like a friend staying in their guest house rather than a stranger in an Airbnb!

From the spacious bathroom with a beautiful shower to the modern kitchen, you will be amazed at all the amenities offered for your use. The towels, blankets, duvets, and bed are top quality; the decor is modern and peaceful. After a long day of sightseeing in Boston you will be able to relax in the sitting area inside or even outside on the private patio with your favorite wine. The parking space is an additional luxury and the neighborhood is charming and safe. It will comfortably accommodate 2 or 3 people. This is a wonderful alternative to an hotel and highly recommended."

Although  we didn't  get  a chance  to  meet  her everything  was as promised  and presented  clearly . We stayed  for  5 nights  and the place  was even better  than  the  photos . Located in quite  wonderful  neighborhood  and if you're  driving  there  are public  parking  available  nearby . We highly  recommend  her place .  Thank  you  so much  Rosie !
11474006,90417034,2016-08-01,5257560,Marek,Very pleasant stay in Boston. Recommended.
11474006,92406019,2016-08-08,11848171,Guillaume,"Rosie & Pat were very nice and friendly hosts. They gave us useful indications on the places to visit in the city + insiders' tips, greatly appreciated!"
Their flat,"situated in Boston's \"\"Southie\"\" is from walking distance to most shops & restaurants in the area. It's a lovely top floor appartment and our room had everything we needed. It's located in a quiet neighbourhood although not far from Boston City Centre.",,,,
"I highly recommend staying at Rosie's place!\"",,,,,
11474006,97789516,2016-08-28,14915384,Leila,"We had a lovely stay at Rosies place in Southie. Rosie wasn't home during our stay, but everything went smoothly and communication was a breeze."
Rosies apartment is in a cute part of Southie and easily connects you to public transport taking you to all of Boston. The Broadway station of the red line is about a 10 minute walk and bus 9 around the corner will take you to back bay while bus 11 will take you to Chinatown (for dim sum!). There are grocery stores and great breakfast and brunch spots within walking distance. This apartment is on the fourth floor so probably not for those who are mobility limited. It has great AC and is clean,with fresh and fragrant bedding.,,,,
"All in all a great Base for exploring boston!\"",,,,,

13589,38086,2010-04-26,68583,Renee,We really loved staying in the brownstone.  It was close to everything we wanted and just as explained.  Seamless Transition was very helpful even in a last minute pinch!  Very happy with it all!
13589,146041,2010-11-29,160686,Jeffrey,Very nice and clean unit.  Great location for our purposes.  Only one minor complaint - the couch is not comfortable either for sitting on or for sleeping.
13589,156214,2010-12-20,308014,Shze Hui,"The place was very well kept and thoughtfully designed. The lower-level bedroom was drafty at times, but otherwise it was lovely, clean and spacious enough for our family of 6."

13589,591873,2011-10-03,866171,Melissa,"Place and location were awesome! very clean, great kitchen. Pull out couch was uncomfortable though!"
13589,665795,2011-10-26,1038407,Aven,The location is perfect to get to know Boston.  Easy walk to the T and right next to the Common.  There is a bit of street noise as Beacon is pretty busy.  There are no 100% private bedroom in this unit.  They all have some sort of open wall that had shutters for privacy.  That is important to know when you are traveling with young children.  There are also a lot of stairs.  The two bathrooms are adequate with great water pressure.  It is not fancy but has everything you need.
13589,733154,2011-11-21,1097972,Lucy,"Nice house, great location and with more space than I expected."
13589,767210,2011-12-06,1292110,Paul,"The apartment was well-equipped, very comfortable and the family loved the old-world charm with the historic building, staircase, high ceilings, etc. Easy walking distance to parks, shops and train stations.  My children now wish to spend the rest of their lives in Boston"
13589,2837853,2012-11-08,3394221,Vanessa,"Great location, super cute place, very clean - There was more than enough space for the 6 of us and we all loved it! If I were fortunate enough to travel to Boston more often, I would absolutely want to stay at this place again!"
13589,3055999,2012-12-11,2001484,Andrea,This is a beautiful apartment in a great location.  It seems to be newly remodeled.  We were five adults and it was perfect for us.  Thanks!
13589,3138375,2012-12-23,2813825,Suzi,"This was a fantastic apartment and we would definitely return. It was in a great position to see everything - just a block from Boston Common, a short stroll to downtown and Newbury Street. The apartment was beautifully finished with everything you could need. There was helpful information so you knew where all facilities were and how to use everything.  Except for the roof leaking on our first rainy day, everything was wonderful."
13589,3382366,2013-01-21,4299644,Alexander,"Location was perfect for our group of 8 that arrived to explore Boston for a weekend. Everybody was pleased with the layout, and it was a much better experience overall than staying in connected hotel rooms."

13589,3531755,2013-02-13,3660843,Hallveig,We had some problems getting to Boston since there was a blizzard and Logan airport closed down the same day we were supposed to arrive and stayed closed for 2 days! Just our luck after having planned this visit for two years!  We therefore arrived two days too late. Seamless Transition was most helpful and they allowed us to change the reservation so we could stay for four nights as planned. For this we are most grateful.
We were three couples travelling together and the apartment suited us very nicely. There is not much privacy since the bedrooms are partly open into the living room area,but that did not trouble us. The apartment is getting a bit  weary,but it was clean.  It  is very well located in a nice street,central and the next T-station is not that far. You can also walk almost everywhere from this location. The Public Gardens and Boston Common are just around the corner and I can just imagine how nice it is to walk there in the summertime.,,
The only downside is that the house was under construction and was completely covered with scaffolds and plastic so could not see out of any of the windows. It was a bit annoying and we would have preferred to know about this in advance.,,,,,
Otherwise we had a wonderful time in  Boston,"even though the city was recovering from the blizzard and a lot of snow everywhere. We will definitely visit again.\"",,,,
13589,3957987,2013-03-31,427064,Mikhail,"Great penthouse unit in a nice building at a GREAT location. Some oddities about the overall experience (late notice on unexpected construction on the outside of the building, an unlocked fire-escape door that lead to another unit and never got locked), presumably unique to our specific visit. Otherwise, the check-in process was smooth, all the codes worked as expected, and the apartment was very clean and well stocked."
13589,4374474,2013-05-01,4954936,Susan,"Great location and perfect setup for our family vacation this past week. The building was under renovations outside, but it didn't affect our stay at all and Seamless Transition notified us of this in advance. They were great. This is located 1/2 a block from the Public Garden and within walking distance of virtually everything. The unit itself was in great shape and well appointed. I loved sitting at the window seat drinking coffee each morning. I would highly recommend this host and this location when you're in Boston. We're coming back next year and will definitely stay here again."
13589,6910077,2013-08-30,5602245,Simon,Was listed as a penthouse but our flat was on the second floor. It was over two floors and a good space. There were a couple maintenance issues which they were surprised about....shower not (URL HIDDEN) door handle (URL HIDDEN) door wouldn't shut. They were helpful and agreed to come and fix them. The air conditioning unit is in the main window of the main room and very noisy. Overall a great location and good space with an excellent kitchen. We left our bags in their office on the last day after checking out and they were really helpful and helped us get a taxi etc.
13589,9198116,2013-12-12,6689260,Vesselin,Great location in the heart of Boston.
We took the whole family on business/family trip.  Everyone had a great time.  The apartment was in a decent shape.  The beds were fine.  The building does have an elevator though its not exactly clearly marked on the first floor,and its classic enough to have just a normal wooden door with a peephole in it.  We only realized it when we saw a warning on the 6th floor to fully close the door.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
13589,10337035,2014-02-14,616156,Cari,Wonderful location and super place!  I would definitely stay again.  Only consideration might be that each of the bedrooms opens onto the main floorplan so that if you are trying to get some real silence but staying with other people (or one that snores!)  this might be difficult.  Otherwise top notch place and service.
13589,10837822,2014-03-10,8178998,Erica,"This was the perfect location for our girls' weekend! Everything was clean, we found everything we needed, and really enjoyed our stay. But the best part about the place by far is its location. We couldn't have found a better place for the price. I would definitely recommend it to others!"
13589,13558881,2014-05-31,762109,Cody,"\"Reviewing this property is a bit difficult because the apartment is not actually owned by Kitty Franklin of Seamless Transition. She acts only as an agent. She simply books with a corporate housing company and takes her cut. The apartments in the building come in various styles and you don't get to specifiy which you want. Ms. Franklin was rude each time I interacted with her via email and on the phone and she even went so far as to say that she was \"\"doing me a favor\"\" by charging $1800 for a 3 night stay. Save yourself the hassle and ripoff and book (EMAIL HIDDEN) I highly recommend the apartment"
The apartment itself (I ended up with the second apartment that you see in the pictures) is nice enough. Small elevator in the lobby. Many small things wrong with the place (holes in dry wall,hot water takes forever to get hot,kitchen light was dangling from the dry wall on the ceiling,etc.) Location is great and there is street,"metered parking. \"",

13589,22986400,2014-11-19,652615,Daniel,"Great service from their team. As a business traveler the amenities for internet, location, and overall convenience were appreciated.

13589,27764917,2015-03-11,2365992,Monty,"Arguably the best location in Boston. Right on the corner of the Boston Gardens and 3min walk to the river. There are very few 3 bedroom options, whilst a little compact and slightly unusual layout it was fantastic to have our group stay together. We would definitely return."

Seamless was great at communicating and answering questions almost instantaneously.  My only worry ahead of time was not being sure exactly what unit I was going to get in the building, but we had a great unit that was pictured and I can only assume the entire building is this nice.  Thanks so much for helping make the trip a success!"
13589,42323396,2015-08-12,15324211,Lisa,Great Neighborhood and comfortable accommodations!  Very nice 3 bedrooms.  The rooms were on the 6th floor with a small elevator and narrow staircase.
13589,45461465,2015-09-03,8408183,Martine,"This was a superb apartment in a great location and met all or our needs. Beds were comfortable and apartment was clean, spacious and kitchen well equipped. We loved that we had a table to sit around and play games - which is one of the reasons we chose an apartment rather than hotel."
"Definitely recommend this place and would gladly stay again. Thanks\"",,,,,
13589,46117608,2015-09-08,8628499,Karen,"The Back Bay Beacon apartments were an excellent place to stay. The location is perfect, the apartment is well appointed and comfortable, and Seamless was very professional with communication. Of particular note, there is a keyless entry system which was perfect for 6 independent adults in our group to come and go as they pleased. Overall, we had an excellent stay and would recommend."
One point to note for groups with different sleeping needs: there are 3 separate bedrooms,but all bedrooms are adjacent to the main area by shutters only,"so sound and light from the main area spill into the bedrooms.\"",,,
13589,47350801,2015-09-18,14451896,Jane,"The place was very clean, comfortable, and attractive. It worked well for three couples. There was a good supply of most necessities (like tp),  and the location was fabulous."

13589,53340807,2015-11-08,33665751,Reid,"\"Great job communicating; easy to get in.  The neighborhood was awesome for us; Beacon Street is in the middle of everything and only a block from the Boston Common.   The unit was clean and everything was fine for us.  The bedrooms are kind of \"\"open\"\" from a noise perspective"
13589,55450479,2015-12-01,18697983,John,"Pros: Location (heart of Back back, steps from The Charles, Boston Common, Newbury & Commonwealth Streets); Very Clean and no sign of wear & tear; professional apartment so no knick-knacks and personal stuff lying around; spacious; all amenities/soap/towels clean and present; fully stocked kitchen (appliance/silverware/plates/cups-wise); accessible and professional management; code-based apartment entry (not keys) very convenient esp since we had 5 guests; if you need 3 bedroom apartment in this area -- i'd definitely choose this one."
"Cons: We stayed in 6F the top floor (there are 3 units associated with this listing) which seems to be a converted \"\"attic\"\" so ceilings are only about 7.5 feet tall; occasional spiders/millipedes as is common with older apartments; the first 7 photos in the listing are for a different unit; elevator is super old (holds 4 ppl) and sometimes did not work so had to take stairs 6 flights;  dining room table and couch actually too big for the space; heat was same thermostat for up/downstairs so upstairs was too hot if downstairs was perfect (or vice versa); kitchen a bit small for apartment of this size.\"",,,,,

13589,76354185,2016-05-26,49266618,Ana,"The apartment is really nice and clean. It sleeps 6 people comfortably. The location is a beutiful, residential area, 10 min walking to many shops and restaurants, and train stations. Some of the attractions like Boston Common and the Freedom Trail are also within walking distance. The only thing to improve would be the internet connection which worked on and off."
13589,77948120,2016-06-04,35002666,Michel,"Fantastic central Boston location, easy walk to the common, Newbury St, many restaurants. Easy walk to Cambridge as well. Keyless entry made logistics easy. Apartment was in good shape, very clean, comfy beds, nice linens, nice kitchen, everything in working order."
One bedroom is on the main level,"the other two are upstairs and have pretty low ceilings. Although the building has an elevator the main entry is stairs and then given the stairs in the apartment you may want to consider a different place if you have mobility problems (we had our parents with us and it was a bit iffy for them).\"",,,,

It was easy to get access to the building. Look carefully for the small elevator in the back else you will be climbing a lot of stairs.,,,,,
The apartment was cozy. Slept the 6 of us comfortably (3 beds).,,,,,
A bonus is that there is not much non-resident parking in Backbay. The street in front of the apartment has public metered parking and it is free from 6pm to 8am the next day!,,,,,
There was some minor damage to the apartment that I made the host aware of. They responded quickly and were very accommodating (fixed the Wifi).,,,,,

6131224,32572466,2015-05-19,22899988,Saron,I loved this place! The home looked exactly how it does in the pictures and it's in a great location. Lawrence is extremely helpful and easy to get in contact with. His directions were very easy to understand and the place really felt like my family's temporary home away from home. Would definitely stay there again when I return to Boston.
6131224,34307752,2015-06-07,31993775,Ginger,Lawrence was an excellent host and was available by phone or text at any time during our whole trip. The apartment was absolutely beautiful and immaculately clean. It's very nicely decorated and very bright and open feeling with all of the natural light coming in from all of the windows . It was quiet in the apartment with nice views overlooking the park next door.  There is plenty of room for a whole family with the three bedrooms and it's much larger than most of the other apartments that we looked at while planning our trip. It was also great that off street parking was included with the apartment at no additional charge as the parking situation in Boston is horrible. The Forrest Hills Station of the T was a short drive away and it was easy to access the whole rest of the city from there. The few times that we did drive in to the city it was only about a 1/2 hour at most to downtown. Overall it was a great place to stay for our family trip to Boston.
6131224,39552438,2015-07-24,38348219,Kim,"Carrie and Lawrence have a lovely home. It had everything we needed. The place was clean. The beds and pillows were comfy. The appliances and air conditioning were all in good working order. We loved having our coffee on the balcony every morning.

The location: in Hyde Park,very close to the neighborhood center. The house overlooks a park where basketball and baseball is played. The games ended early enough and our kids liked watching from the dining room. We took walks in the evening there when it wasn't too hot. Nice to have green to look out at.,,,,
The apartment: Lovely decor,tons of space for us (3BR),nice bedding and towels,and fully supplied kitchen. We didn't use the washer and dryer,but they're down in the basement. Sweet,helpful neighbors.
We had absolutely no problems here. We all enjoyed staying in this very nice,"spacious apartment. We would recommend it!\"",,,,

The people living downstairs seemed very friendly."
We gave Lawrence a call to ask about something we misunderstood on the check-in guide (mistake was from our end),and he responded immediately,and sorted us out right away.,,,

The room was \"\"bright\"\" because there are no curtains.  Since the room faced the street"

1839549,13357429,2014-05-26,14343307,Gina,Ari was very pleasant.
The neighborhood was fine.,,,,,
It wasn't quite what we expected (it was not possible to lock our door when we left the room) but the bed was comfortable.  The house seems to be in the process of refurbishment,"with newly refinished floors.\"",,,,
1839549,13622659,2014-06-01,15154168,Raef,"Ari was really a great host. The room was clean, airy, and cozy. He made sure that everything is ready before my arrival. He was also very responsive which simplified things and made my stay really good. I would certainly pick this place again!"
1839549,13725958,2014-06-02,16142225,Irene,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was a great recommendation for airbnb.  The room was exactly as pictured:  very clean, sunny, bright and cozy.  Host Ari was cordial but not intrusive.  The room was very quiet, the house felt very secure.  Ari said I was welcome to use the kitchen for cooking and store things in the kitchen frig, but the room also had a small private frig!    Also, Ari went to extra effort to contact a friend for information I needed locally and he did so very promptly.  I would recommend this room and this host HIGHLY!!!!!"
1839549,13860466,2014-06-06,337220,Sebastian,"Ari is a very friendly, easy-going and very accomodating host. The room was clean and in a great area with a vibrant night life. Recommended!"

1839549,14103630,2014-06-11,16148612,James,"My experience with Ari continues to be a top-notch one. The place has been kept up great; in fact, while I've been here, Ari's been installing A/C units in a bunch of rooms. It's pretty cool to see the place constantly improving, even when it was great to begin with. I'd stay again if I come back to Boston."
1839549,14141347,2014-06-12,16582449,John,"Ari was a great host. He was very communicative before I arrived, making sure I knew where I was going and that he'd be home to greet me."
He set me up in a clean room with clean sheets (I watched him put them on),gave me a tour of the place and helped me plan how to get to my meeting the next day.,,,,
"This was my first experience with AirBnB and Ari made it a very positive one.\"",,,,,
1839549,14470349,2014-06-20,12648823,Richard,"As soon as I arrived, Ari showed me to my room and chatted with me for a while to get to know me. He's a top guy and I felt completely at home straight away. Loved the room and the location. Plenty of shops nearby and a ten minute walk to a T station to get you in the city centre."
1839549,14992338,2014-06-30,16148612,James,"Ari's as excellent a host as when I first arrived in Boston, and I'm pleased to say that his home remains a peaceful place to retire at the end of the day. My prior recommendations most definitely still stand."
1839549,15502417,2014-07-10,16148612,James,"Still staying in Allston at Ari's and I have discovered that he has the most adorable cat ever. Not sure if this tips the scales for anyone looking to rent, but it should because she is SO CUTE."
"Ari's still as helpful & mindful of the house as he's been the last month or so; I continue to recommend a stay here.\"",,,,,

1839549,18717906,2014-08-31,11653298,Anna,"I spend about 10 days at Ari's before moving in somewhere else for a whole semester. He was a great host, always ready to help you  (advice for a phone, shops in the corner...) The place is quiet and clean. I really had a good time."
1839549,18859150,2014-09-01,20540851,心彥,Spent only one night with Ari before moving into my new place. Ari is very nice and courteous host. The room is very nice and comfortable.  Thanks Ari!

I stayed in room #1 which is very comfortable and well stocked with an AC unit, microwave, mini-fridge and queen bed. His house is in a hip location and close to the T line, which takes about 20 minutes to get to downtown. I had a pleasant stay at Ari's apartment."
1839549,36138601,2015-06-25,10434469,Alina,I must say I had a pleasant stay at Aris! Even though I didn't get to meet him because he was traveling abroad he was still really kind checking in on me and making sure I was okay! Great location. Nearby bars and easy to get around with public transportation. The room is cute and cozy! Love how the bed was nuzzled in a corner with a window bringing sunshine in :) I would definitely stay here again and recommend it! Thanks Ari!
1839549,36483230,2015-06-28,21663780,Constance,"Ari was quick to respond and arrange my stay. The location of this property, Allston, is excellent (especially for young people). You will be close to groceries, restaurants, public transportation (T and bus), nightlife, BC, BU, Harvard, MIT and many other institutions."

1839549,37271616,2015-07-05,7043350,Ryan,"The neighborhood was PERFECT! I planned a last minute trip to Boston for the 4th by myself and was afraid I wouldn't know where to go or what to do. Right across the street is the best of Boston's night life, really friendly neighbors, and plenty of restaurants. The T is easy to find as well, so I was able to go all over Boston during my stay."
1839549,45794679,2015-09-06,38047251,Arnold,"You can call this a home more than a house. The place was very well maintained and cleaned twice every week,professionally. The room is well furnished and perfectly identical to the pictures.  Although, I couldn't meet Ari in person, he made sure everything went perfectly fine. He took quick measures if something wasn't working fine. He was a good host, and I look forward to staying there again."
1839549,52714616,2015-11-01,14948999,Vero,Room was clean and house was quiet. We stayed one night and had a great time. Well managed bnb!
1839549,58895880,2016-01-05,30501848,Akshay R,It's close to the bus line (50 feet away!) And less than 10 minutes away from the Green Line. The room is spacious and comfortable. The apartment is frequently cleaned which is really nice. The apartment is next to great restaurants and take out places. Only problem is that it's noisy at night but that's city life.
1839549,60399200,2016-01-23,30501848,Akshay R,"It was a really cool upbeat neighbourhood with a lot of cuisine choices, in all price ranges.  The food in the Allston area is fantastic and the house is located perfectly to access all these places.  Further on the proximity to the 57 and 66 buses is great, along with the proximity to Tedeschi, Walgreens and CVS."
Ari was very helpful and would continue to make incremental changes to improve living environments (such as providing heaters,"and hampers for the laundry) which was especially helpful for those of us staying long term.\"",,,,
1839549,60626796,2016-01-25,30501848,Akshay R,"Listing description was accurate.  Reasonably fast WiFi, easy access to buses, 10 minutes from B Line T.  Clean sheets, comfortable bed. Allston is a great area especially for food- recommend Twin Donuts(great and affordable breakfast), Punjabi Palace, Whole Heart Provisions(supremely healthy and delicious), La Belfana Pizzaria, and I didn't even get to go to all the places to eat out :(."

He coordinated everything perfectly and if I had any problem at home he fixed it immediately. His house is great! You can find there everything what you need. My room, kitchen and bathrooms were always clean and there are clean laundries. The bus station is 1 min from the house and location is perfect and safe. There are lots of restaurants, markets, clubs and bars nearby. I had really good 3 months there. Thank you, Ari! I will miss Boston and my cozy room!"

1839549,73677540,2016-05-09,66874384,Angela,"Host: Ari was the best first Airbnb host I can ever ask for. When I inquired about one of his listings, which was booked seconds before I asked about it, he was kind enough to suggest another listing that met the conditions I was looking for. I might not have met him personally during my trip to Boston since he was overseas, but he was easily reachable by all means available."
Listing: Based on my experience,it was similar to a hotel room because it was spacious,bright,cool,and smelled of fresh linen. The bed was so soft and comfortable that it's easy to take a nap in the middle of the day even with the sun shining through the blinds. The desk and chair were a good feature; the desk was long enough that you could work on your laptop on the left side,and enjoy a meal on the right side. There's also a wide mirror attached to the wall above the desk
The room has a door with a lock and key,so security is not an issue. It is also located right beside the shared bathroom,that is always a good feature especially when you need to make trips in the middle of the night (if you have a small bladder :P).,,,
As for the house itself,it's in a good location that's within walking distance (1min tops) from the nearest T-stop,and a good breakfast place/diner called Twin Donuts. Although it took a while,I did not have a difficult time locating it,given that I was new to Boston and I used public transportation from the airport.,
All in all,when I find myself back in Boston,"I'd definitely check back in here.\"",,,

I will stay again next time I visit my son in Boston.  He has maid service so you always have a tidy stay.

1648950,7888951,2013-10-07,255337,Jessie,"Hosts were great to work with, super easy getting in and out of the apartment and the location is prime. It is a basement apartment, so you definitely hear the people above you quite a bit, but we were so tired by the end of the night that we slept fine. Overall, nice place and great hosts to work with."

Close to t station and walking distance to river, parks, shops etc. The condo was.... Fun! First time experience with AirBnB and would definitely do it again. The host was very helpful and friendly. 10/10"
1648950,9806751,2014-01-11,8782116,Justine,Great location! Apartment was cozy and inviting. Perfect place for one or two people to stay and the host was prompt in his responses. I would definitely book again.
1648950,10658876,2014-03-02,11377949,Jeff,Christopher's apt was wonderful. I thought it was extremely charming and enjoyed the layout. This was my first time visiting boston and the neighborhood was definitely in a prime location. Close to a train and some fun bars and restaurants. Christopher was great and clear with communication. I would highly recommend.
1648950,11712569,2014-04-13,12383367,Marisa,"This place looked exactly as in the pictures. It's true that it is a basement suit but I heard very little noise from above. It was clean, the bed was comfortable, and there were all of the amenities one needs when living (and cooking) away from home. The location was great. Key pickup and drop off was simple and easy.

It is only a short walk to Whole Foods for great groceries.  Whole foods is also a restaurant.  Safe quiet area in Beacon Hill.  Very clean.  Kitchen is moderately equipped.  So, you can easily do breakfasts and lunches.  Perfect for a businessman.  I was there for a trade show.  Fast wifi is nice."
1648950,13213163,2014-05-22,13718559,Alex,Christopher's place in Beacon Hill is great for single travellers or couples. It's cosy and has more than everything you need for a short stay. Can't speak highly enough of the location. When I arrived the place was clean and organised. You're close to the T and Boston Common. Would recommend!
1648950,13456451,2014-05-27,4570656,Rebecca,"The apartment was as described and as per the pictures. A lovely space with everything you need for your stay. It is a great location really close to great restaurants and shops. Would definitely recommend this as a great place to stay for a few days whilst exploring Boston. It was also super clean and tidy and it was lovely to arrive late and night and to find a light on - a really thoughtful touch. Christopher was also super easy to communicate with and pick up of keys etc was super easy. My only comment would be to check the location ahead of booking as the map shown on the site isn't totally accurate... As I said, it is a great location so not a problem at all just would have been good to know up front."
1648950,14206958,2014-06-14,16367775,Chris,"Chris St. Cyr was a fine host, and responded immediately with a personal visit  when I could not get the tv to work.  He also suggested good places in the neighborhood for food and beverage."
1648950,14885376,2014-06-28,9013405,Justin,"The apartment is cute in a fantastic neighborhood! There is very little reason to rent a car as it is in the perfect location for walking around downtown, taking the train to where ever, or catching a cab (as a last resort). Christopher is a good host who is very responsive when you need him. I do recommend."
1648950,15161348,2014-07-03,1159233,Bernie,"Loved loved our stay in Christopher's apartment on Beacon Hill. It's a fantastic location, is exactly as its described in the listing, and Christopher is a very responsive host so while we didn't actually meet him, he responded to all our queries promptly and ensured we had a great stay. It's a gorgeous apartment and was perfect for exploring Boston. Highly recommended"

1648950,17300495,2014-08-10,9432326,Alice,"My husband and I stayed in this apartment for a week while visiting Boston.  The location in Beacon Hill was excellent, very close to the MGH/Charles Street T stop and within walking distance to many sights.  The price per night was far below what it would have cost to stay in a hotel and we had a kitchen to cook our own meals.  Whole Foods Market is a close walk, less than 10 minutes from the apartment.  Beacon Hill is very lovely and mostly quiet,  with Boston Commons a short walk away."
Christopher was responsive in our communication,he answered my emails promptly.  Shortly after our arrival in the apartment,the owner (not Christopher) showed up to pick up some of his things as he was in process of moving for school.  This may explain why some things were missing in the apartment.  The kitchen was a huge bonus for me as we do not like to eat out every meal for a week.  It was fairly well stocked but there was no baking dishes or microwave,which I must admit I really did not miss.  The is also no cable or local TV,it was all streaming Netflix.  The bedroom has a window air conditioner,which is fairly noisy but did a pretty good job of keeping the apartment cool when we were there.  The dresser in the bedroom was broken on our arrival
My husband and I are pretty low maintenance,"so overall it was a positive experience and I would recommend this apartment for couples visiting the Boston area.  \"",,,,

Apartment is in a great locations, minutes from Charles Street, the T, and  many tourist locations - about a  20 min walk to downtown and close to great restaurants and shops. Would definitely recommend to stay for a few days while exploring Boston."
1648950,19782412,2014-09-18,70685,Quinn,"This apartment was in a great location. Minutes from cute Charles Street and T stop. Easy walk to the rest of the city. Apartment was clean, simple, nice and good for one person attending a conference. Communication was a bit sparse before I arrived, leaving me a little unsure of how everything would be handled but it all worked out. I guess I'm just used to a little more host communication but it wasn't problematic. Make sure you understand it's not in Back Bay like the map here shows. I figured it wasn't since the title has Beacon Hill in it but just wanted to let anyone else know off the bat."

Christopher was responsive in our communication and so nice allowing us to leave our bags packed for a few hours before the check-out. I would definitely recommend to stay for some days while exploring Boston."
1648950,21084624,2014-10-11,20943472,Ching Ching,The location of this flat is great.  It locates in a pleasant and charming neighborhood.  It is very close to red line subway station.  Quiet neighborhood with a lot of nice houses around.  Within walking distance to Boston Common and Public park.
"Flat is quite clean and looks exactly like the photo.  We enjoyed our stay there.  :-)\"",,,,,
1648950,21383101,2014-10-16,10626219,Valeria,"I was in Boston for few days. This apt is well located.. But poor equipped.. You miss maybe some fork/knives The living room is quite big even if it is a bit dark. The bed room has a good bed to sleep and recover. The contracts with the host were good enough to have all the information about stay and apt. Nearby train station -red line-, gardens and Charles River to run and supermarket - whole foods-"
1648950,21486027,2014-10-18,9094782,Hereward,"Great location, lovely apartment, really felt like you were staying with a friend. Chris was helpful when I mis-remembered the entry instructions too."
1648950,21828319,2014-10-25,1898329,Dave,"One-week stay.  The apartment has a great location, good space, a nice bed and a reasonable rental rate for that part of Boston.  I wouldn't mind staying there again."
Alas,that said there are some points to note,a few of which have been observed by other guests...,,,
Christopher isn't the most responsive host you'll find.  I had to send repeated queries,before getting any response.  Also,he was quite curt.,,,
As for the apartment,start by observing that there is only a photo of the bed in the airbnb listing.  While it is a workable 1 bedroom apartment,I don't understand anyone calling it charming or chic. The living space is adequate but quite basic.  In an email,Christopher called it a 'garden' apartment,which apparently is a code term.  It is a basement apartment,with 7' ceilings
A tip about the front door:  It has 4 locks.  One of them turns in the opposite direction from the others.  Guess which one.  Guess when you are tired.  Yeah,it was fun for me,too,eventually discovering that the second one turns counter-clockwise.  (On the other hand,the front door is in an enclosed space,which is nice if there is inclement weather while you are guessing about the locks...)
The apartment had been cleaned poorly.  I liked seeing the request to remove my shoes,since I take them off for my own home.  But the floor was quite gritty; wipe your bare feet before putting on socks.  And there was a large area of thin,red mold in a corner of the bathtub,and the rest of it wasn't all that clean.  Since the apartment overall seemed in reasonable shape,my suspicion is the previous guest was a slob,but really
There are plenty of dishes and glasses but meager cooking gear and only two sets of silverware.,,,,,
The listing cites 'television',which in this case means only a Roku to the Internet.  Netflix worked,which was nice,but Hulu didn't,which meant no broadcast stations.  However it did let me finally catch up on the second season of House of Cards.  But not much use otherwise.  Also I couldn't find the remote for the TV,just the Roku.  So adjustments to the TV were a pain.
Internet access was excellent.  (20Mbps.),,,,,
All of my other airbnb experiences have been stellar.  So I'll suggest re-reading the opening paragraph of this review.,,,,,
(Since Christopher hasn't posted comments on my stay yet,I'll be a bit defensive and note that I stripped the bed and ran the dishwasher and otherwise left the apartment as I found it,"but with some additional cleaning products and foodstuffs...)\"",,,
1648950,22611126,2014-11-10,17114439,Jesse,Chris' place was perfectly located to explore Boston. The cobbled stoned streets and beautiful brown stone building reminded my  boyfriend and I why we like to Air B and B over finding a hotel in a commercial district.
Chris was an excellent host. He accomdated our requests and the place was clean and welcoming. One thing to note is the place we stayed in was a basement apartment. We might have read the description more carefully. However,that being said,for a basement apartment there was a lot of natural light.,,,
"\"",,,,,
1648950,25336146,2015-01-12,10951443,Katie,"My husband, Cole, and I really enjoyed our stay in this apartment. The check in process was smooth. The value can not be beat for the central location. The weather was quite cold during our stay but the apartment was alway nice and cozy. We had everything we could have needed. We would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
1648950,25555921,2015-01-19,5251724,Jonathan,Perfect location and cozy one bedroom apartment. The checkin process was super easy. We enjoyed our stay in Christopher's apartment very much. Would definitely rent this place again if we were coming back to Boston.
1648950,26037756,2015-02-01,26862152,Jeff,This apartment offered a cozy stay in the heart of Beacon Hill. Just a short walk from the T and a stones throw from Beacon Hill Pub (if you've been you know how awesome this place is) you were well within reach of everything you would like to do. the bed was slightly firm but all in all the apartment was a delight and reasonably priced. There is a wide range of strategically placed items in the apartment to fill the down time.
1648950,27282852,2015-03-01,20608871,Christine,"Great location - close to the T, shops, and restaurants. Clean place and reasonably priced. The host got back to me with all questions and was flexible with a late check-out time.  We did have to buy TP (there was not an extra roll) and hand soap."
1648950,27700395,2015-03-09,20353316,David,Great location in Beacon Hill with quick access to food and transportation.  A nice sized place for a solo traveler.
1648950,27820539,2015-03-12,18968755,Nathan,"Nice, quiet condo in a very convenient location.  Lock-box made gaining access to the condo very easy.  No complaints."
1648950,28713982,2015-03-29,27365026,Katie,"Great location in Beacon Hill - convenient for exploring downtown Boston and the Freedom Trail. Apartment was clean, cosy and comfortable. Check-in was smooth."
N.b. Two bath towels were provided but bring your own hand towels,tea towel,"wash cloth and toiletries. \"",,,
1648950,29767178,2015-04-12,8263568,Ben,"First things first, the location is superb. Beacon Hill is really nice and on the doorstep of the Freedom Trail, etc, etc. Definitely check out Charles Street and all the restaurants and bars it offers."
The apartment is a decent size,slightly lower ceilings than most due to being a basement apartment,but not an issue. The bed isn't the most comfortable ever,but we slept in there three nights without incident.,,
One thing to point out is that you shouldn't expect to hear from Christopher. We found this a bit disconcerting,especially given we had just driven 9 hours to Boston from Toronto. Although we eventually noticed that Christopher provided instructions to get into the apartment in the automated confirmation message,we sent two messages before we arrived and never received a response. We were therefore slightly unsure as to whether we would be able to get in,whether he was expecting us,etc. It worked out fine and maybe not any contact with the host suits some people,"but it made the whole experience a bit impersonal and \"\"un-Airbnb\"\".\""
1648950,30564698,2015-04-24,28266170,Shelley,All was fine with the apartment and in a fantastic location although it is a basement apartment which wasn't quite clear from post.
1648950,31722847,2015-05-09,9254896,Greta,The apartment was very nice. Especially the location with several nice cafes close by where you could have breakfast. The communication with Christoph was very easy and fast. Close to the Charles subway stop so it is easy to go to other places to.
1648950,32027027,2015-05-12,28027466,Prisc,"Our stay was wonderful! While this is a basement apartment, it was quaint and well decorated, organized and quite cute! As with any place you stay, be sure to read the house rules and abide to make this stay the easiest for both parties! We made sure to read everything and it made preparation for our stay even better.. It also made things pretty self explanatory so there weren't many questions for our host. This really is quite close to everything, and gave a great introduction for what to expect in Boston!"
1648950,32335854,2015-05-17,15787006,Christopher,Great location. Lower level apartment with limited supplies. No air conditioning and no microwave. Host is easy to reach and friendly.
1648950,32847164,2015-05-22,11520872,Dale,"Fantastic apartment.  Great location.  Thank you, Christopher!"
1648950,33973978,2015-06-02,11520872,Dale,Great stay at the apartment as usual.  This is my second stay here and wouldn't hesitate to stay again.  Location A+ and really nice not to be in a hotel.
1648950,34280541,2015-06-07,28875580,Michael,"the appartment is very well-located in beautiful, very quiet and safe beacon hill, only a 3min-footwalk from the subway."
the appartment was clean,spacious enough for two persons and as described,except that it is in the basement. because of that is was cold. in addition to that it is poorly sound-proofed,so you can slightly hear the neighbours and the subway.,,
"all in all we were really satisfied. for a holiday trip to boston it is the perfect stay. we would book this again.\"",,,,,
1648950,34730933,2015-06-11,6424046,Elaine,"Chris place suited me perfectly for short work trip. Apartment was clean, tidy and great location. Instructions for entry and getting there were spot on and would definitely stay again."
1648950,35216393,2015-06-16,16654489,Liz,"This is an exceptionally clean place in a great location in one of the best walking cities in the country.  It is quiet and safe.  There is good wifi and a smart TV.  There is no toaster, microwave or coffee maker."
1648950,35598138,2015-06-20,2966212,Kevin,The location was perfect and the apartment was very clean. Couldn't have asked for a better place.

1648950,37149605,2015-07-05,9921469,Logan,"Boston was awesome! If you're looking for a place that is in the middle of everything, and you want a ton to do; this is where you wanna stay. It was clean and in a great, quiet neighborhood. It was a little smaller than I'd hoped and it's only cooled by a single window unit. This wasn't an issue in the bedroom, where the unit was, but with warmer days the living room was incredibly stuffy. The bed was enough to sleep on but if you are expecting a normal sleeping experience, stay in a hotel. The unit is also a garden unit so you go down into it, and the four deadbolts seemed like overkill but if that's what needed, so be it."
I did like the apartment,don't get me wrong. Just being honest.,,,,
If you're looking for somewhere clean and safe to lay your head and spend tons of time running around Boston (like we did),this is a great place. If you're looking for space and a super comfortable vacation,"you may want to keep looking around\"",,,
1648950,37702212,2015-07-09,25603110,Angela,"The apartment is well located to explore Boston, and in a nice area just around the corner from the shops and restaurants of Charles Street. There is also a laundrette at the end of the road if you need it. The apartment was clean and tidy when I arrived, and as described. The host and I did have a bit of an issue with communication when I didn't receive any messages until the day of my arrival, although the host did say he had emailed and texted me."
1648950,38472209,2015-07-15,34551616,Michael,Nice little apartment in a great part of the city.
1648950,39651967,2015-07-25,29656658,Lauren,Our stay was great. I got confused about the location and getting into the apartment and Chris answered right when I called to clear up my confusion. The apartment was clean and easy walk or uber ride to the places we wanted to visit. The only thing I would point out is that the window air conditioning unit and dehumidifier are located in the bedroom and provide quite a loud hum if you war used to sleeping in a more quiet space but kept the room comfortable.
1648950,40644622,2015-08-01,36204818,Sayed,The host was very helpful. The location is better than perfect.
"Only the kitchenware had somehow poor quality.\"",,,,,
1648950,40878970,2015-08-02,21699172,Scott,Amazing location!!  Close to restaurants and the T. Small 1 bedroom garden view was clean and had good water pressure and window A/C in bedroom was key. Low hassle all around.
1648950,41273507,2015-08-05,8671916,Ian,Perfect for what I needed. Easy location for my work and a great neighborhood.
1648950,42269302,2015-08-12,35088412,Orla,"Great apartment in a fantastic location! We only had to get the T once (Charles/MGH is just 2 minutes away) and that was to get to Harvard, everywhere else in the city was within walking distance. It was great to be so close to Boston Common and The Public Gardens. Christopher was very friendly and helpful with lots of tips on where to eat and where to go.  Would love to stay there again next time I'm in Boston."
1648950,43936340,2015-08-23,9229186,Tom,Trouble free experience.  Great location in a simple and clean one bedroom. Since it's a basement unit there's not much daylight during the day but who cares if you're out and about?  Super location and the unit is very quiet.  Nice little kitchen with fridge and stove.  It's summer so the wall cooler had to run constantly as in most older units.  We would stay again.
1648950,46745899,2015-09-13,5019389,Andrew,"My wife and I had a great time staying in Christopher's apartment for 8 nights. Location is everything to me and my wife, and the apartment's location couldn't be beat. Situated in Beacon Hill, the apartment is within walking distance of everything you could want:"
- 24/7 CVS (~3 minutes),,,,,
- Charles/MGH Metro Station (~3 minutes),,,,,
- Boston Commons (~5 minutes),,,,,
- Whole Foods (-5 Minutes),,,,,
- Freedom Trail (~5 Minutes),,,,,
- Faneuil Hall (~15 minutes),,,,,
- Waterfront ~(20 minutes),,,,,
- North End (~20 minutes),,,,,
Getting to the apartment was also extremely easy,from Logan we took the free Silver Line to the Red Line. Leaving,an Uber to Logan cost about ~$20 and took only 10 minutes. Getting the key also went without a hitch.,,,
The apartment was clean and comfortable. WiFi worked great and we were able to watch Netflix without any issue.,,,,,
The only minor issue we had with the apartment was the wall A/C unit made a funny noise when it rained. This only happened one night,"so it wasn't a huge deal for us.\"",,,,

1648950,49446499,2015-10-04,2539291,Joey,Clear check-in instructions. The place is very basic. The great thing about it is the location in the charming Beacon Hill neighborhood. Bring earplugs - the subway goes right below you.

1171578,6839506,2013-08-26,452836,Pamela,"We recently stayed at Frank's over the weekend while in Boston for a christening. He was a SUPERB host, making sure we had everything we needed, and even going as far to ensure a neighbor would be home to greet us since he already had previous plans. Frank has a very lovely home, and the space available for rent is almost like a separate house. You have the entire upstairs with your private bathroom (great shower pressure), living area with nice flat screen and a nice bar. The bedroom has GREAT GREAT air flowing through and we slept with the balcony sliding doors open with no problem. There is a queen size comfy bed, and a twin daybed so perhaps more than 2 people could stay. Also from the balcony you may be able to catch a glimpse of his BEAUTIFUL antique Rolls Royce!  Overall Frank is a great host and the location is terrific. Accessible to the T, bus, and very easy to get to. He even allowed us to park on his property since we drove, so we wouldn't look for parking at night after going out in town. We will deff be staying here again next time we go to Boston!!!"

Even though we were mostly out and about a lot, we rested so well in your homely, comfortable room and the bed - excellent! And thanks for accommodating me my Espresso Moka machine every morning :). Hope we can come back. I&D"
1171578,12011435,2014-04-21,12880079,Michelle,Frank was a wonderful host. The room we stayed in was massive and had all accommodations we could imagine. They are a bus ride away from Fenway Park and pretty much everything. One negative is the hill that must be trekked to get there. It would be best to have a car and avoid walking the hill.
1171578,12156808,2014-04-24,12487132,Chiara,Frank and his wife were excellent hosts.
The house was very nice and clean. The neighborhood was quiet.,,,,,

We truly enjoyed the company of Charlene and Frank and were glad for the private parking in the back. Frank's recommendation for a Saturday brunch at Mel's was perfect. The atmosphere couldn't be better in this retro diner. We will come back to Frank and Charlene any time, the location is simply perfect. Thank you, Charlene and Frank."
1171578,13200689,2014-05-21,15491661,Juan,"I had trouble finding a hotel room for my mom when she visited in mid May. It was a blessing in disguise! Discovered Airbnb and found Frank and Charlene's home. They were excellent hosts and got along merrily with my mom. Their home was very comfortable and welcoming. The room for rent is very large, clean, and has a great deck to sit and enjoy the quiet neighborhood. My mom was a bit hesitant about airbnb but by the last nite at Frank's she was cooking dinner for us all! She insists on staying here again during her next visit!"
1171578,13586893,2014-05-31,2313098,Betsy,Fabulous in every way.  Frank was incredibly helpful with assisting us.

1171578,13834463,2014-06-05,7193749,Sunil,"We enjoyed our stay at Frank's place. Frank is a terrific host and it was a pleasure getting to know him a little.  The place is exactly as advertised. Nice large room, clean and well maintained with comfortable beds. Having parking available is a big plus if you are driving.  The location is safe and private and it is not difficult to go to Cambridge or to downtown Boston if you want to drive there. Taking public transportation requires a bit more effort since you need to take a bus to the nearest T station.  Again - driving from here to the other places was easy and it was nice to know that parking was available when you returned.  Frank was very flexible and we enjoyed getting to know him."

The room was exactly as it was presented on the site and was very comfortable! Provided a great night sleep after a long, cold, and wet day sight seeing.

I must say after our 3 night stay we were very comfortable and content with our decision to use airbnb, especially the one we chose.  Frank made us feel welcome and comfortable immediately. He was very accommodating and helpful.  The entire home was immaculate and the room we stayed in was bright and spacious. We traveled without a car and had easy access to the bus and the T.  We love the safe neighborhood and the Town Center.  We had a fantastic experience. We will definitely use airbnb again and hopefully Frank’s place will be available on our next stay."

The apartment is *really* close to downtown Boston/Cambridge,and it's easy to get to/from. We had a car,but shouldn't be too far of a trek on public transportation either.,,,
We'd definitely stay there again.,,,,,

Frank and his wife also gave us a lot of suggestions on the transportation to Boston downtown, and the house's location is good with easy connection to bus and train stations. The room is awesome, and we love it so much. I will choose to stay here again if I have a chance to Boston again in the future. :)"

Frank and Charlene welcomed us warmly.  We shared family stories; they offered commentary about area restaurants, and provided directions to the Northeastern campus that circumvented the morning traffic snarls.  I felt more like a neighbor who had stopped in for a chat than a stranger who happened to be passing through.  The off street parking is a big plus in this pleasant, picturesque community.  I'm looking forward to our next visit."

Frank and Charlene were most welcoming and the room was beautiful, spacious; the bed and pillows, super comfy!  The space felt more like a suite as it's located on the 2nd floor and very private. This is an excellent place to stay with close proximity to Boston so you can avoid the parking hassles and $$$$ hotels! Frank & Charlene recommended a great Italian restaraunt nearby (loved it!) and the short bus ride to and from Boston was such a big bonus after years of traveling to Boston (all the expense & traffic headaches) to see our son at BU. We wholeheartedly recommend staying with Frank & Charlene and we will definitely return again! All the best, Kristen & Marty"

It is accessible to Boston via the 57 bus which passes every 15 minutes from Oak Square, and goes directly to Kenmore Station in Boston, as well as connecting to the Green Line for more extensive access. We successfully rode it back from a Red Sox game at 11:30 on a Saturday night.

Frank and his wife make a wonderful couple - they are very nice, approchable and gracious. They offered us morning coffee when their schedule allows. They would give you the largest freedom during your stay - no pressure of house rules or socialization at all. Their house is beautiful and large. The beautiful and antique furniture would make your stay a unique experience in Boston metropolitan region. It is truly a home away from your actual home."

1171578,74861217,2016-05-17,12191316,Stephanie,"Frank was very accommodating to my schedule, as I didn't arrive until about 10pm. Communication with him was easy and clear.   Their home is in a very nice, safe neighborhood.  No problem whatsoever with the parking--there was a spot right in front of their home.  Frank's house is a beautifully kept and furnished home--super clean and comfortable.  The bedroom was large and lovely, with a super comfy bed.  Both the neighborhood and the house itself was quiet and peaceful--a perfect place for a good night's rest.   The bathroom was close by and had all the needed amenities.  I highly recommend this listing!"

1171578,77794236,2016-06-03,49634222,Donato,All around pleasant experience! very accommodating and great place.
1171578,78088972,2016-06-05,18739264,Josh,Frank was a perfect host. He did everything possible to make us feel comfortable and at home -- and we had some fun hanging out watching sports.
1171578,78773926,2016-06-09,75472649,Amy,This was our first exp. with airbnb and must say that Frank and his wife made it a fantastic one.   Frank checked on us for an arrival time to make sure he was home which I found very comforting and met us at the door when we did arrive.  The room was very clean and comfortable and the house was in a very quiet neighborhood.   We had coffee every morning and the host were full of local information for things to see and do..I will def. look for this location when booking my next trip to Boston.  Highly recommend!
1171578,82052288,2016-06-26,78583723,Magnus,"Frank's home is beautiful. Everything is clean, the neighbourhood is quiet and safe. We easily found a parking spot and a bus stop was only 5 minutes away. With the bus It's easy to get from his house right into the Center of Boston. We met Frank at our arrival and he was very welcoming and eager to help. In the morning Frank and his wife even made us coffee and tea. We had a very pleasant experience in their house and would recommend them anytime."
1171578,83660893,2016-07-03,53498121,Long,"Outstanding place to stay to be honest. The room is super spacious for two, public transportation & gas right around the corner, not far from downtown Boston, excellent amenities. A bonus for me especially was Frank showing how much he liked basketball in the past, thus leading to some fantastic conversations. Highly recommended!"
1171578,85825484,2016-07-13,81315571,Dale,Outstanding hospitality and Boston charm.  Will definitely stay here again.  Large room with two beds and porch.  Plus ample parking behind house for truck/SUV. About one mile walk or bike ride to Charles River which offers many miles of trails on both banks.  I rode from Brighton to Boston Harbor.  Thank you Frank!

1171578,87779125,2016-07-21,58056703,Alex,"Frank was very kind and welcoming to my brother and I! The room he had set up for us was perfect- it was very spacious and the beds were super comfy. Frank has parking behind his house and not on the street, so that was great too. Also, the location in Brighton was terrific- we were able to easily catch the 57 bus to go downtown and to Fenway Park. Would definitely stay again!"
1171578,89200950,2016-07-27,10396790,Yi,"Frank is a super nice person, making us feel at home. The house is at a good lacation, very conveninent to reach downtown or other areas. Frank gave us great suggestions and clear instructions. We had a wonderful journey exploring boston."

It was clean, neat and well organized, just as shown in the pictures. Frank's family is very kind, friendly and meanwhile knows how to keep distance and make us feel free. We would love to repeat the stay at Frank's."
1171578,92986095,2016-08-11,6303251,Takuma,Frank's room and its location was very convenient to have access all the downtown area of Boston.

1171578,94044594,2016-08-14,601802,Jeff,Just a great stay! Frank is a great host! Friendly and helpful - he made me feel right at home.
1171578,95193222,2016-08-18,29409725,Amy,"Frank is extremely friendly and accommodating. The house is spacious, very clean, beautiful and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay in their home. The house is located in a beautiful family-friend community which is close to down, shopping, restaurant and airport. Our room  is very beautiful, big and quiet, safe and clean. Frank is a wonderful host, always available to help and willing to know if everything is fine. He took us by car to the bus station on the first day. Frank and his wife made the coffee for us and talked with us in the morning. It's a wonderful experience for us. We are very grateful that Frank helped to take us to airport in the early morning, thanks a lot to our friendly host. We'd love to visit them again. We definitely recommend people to stay at Frank's house."
1171578,96361445,2016-08-22,72750150,Gerard,This was my wife's 1st AirB&B experience and she loved it.  I spent a few moments with the hosts and they were wonderful.
1171578,98549429,2016-08-31,92346184,Gwendolyn,"The room was stocked with plenty of clean towels, and the sheets smelled clean and fresh. The room was very clean. Our host was very accessible via text message. The neighborhood was so quiet. There were no street noises that one would expect staying in Boston, so I would recommend this for light sleepers who are bothered by traffic sounds. While it was a short walk to a 7-11 and a Dunkin, on our walk we did not see any T stations or bus stations, so I would recommend that if you are staying here, download Uber! The room was huge, the shower and bathroom were very clean (though the bathroom was tiny, but that wasn't an issue for us). Frank left the Wifi password written for us, which was very nice, though neither of us used it so cannot comment.  I would recommend this room for those who want to visit Boston, but want a more calm, peaceful place to return to at night."
12580274,74506772,2016-05-15,58264447,Judy,I needed to book a place due to sudden changes in my schedule and this place was perfect! Ivan was very kind and friendly and helped me find the way to my destination.
12580274,74994557,2016-05-18,9262108,Jonas,Ivan went out of his way to make me feel welcome and at home. I was worried that I wouldn't find a place hours before my arrival time. Good thing Ivan came to the rescue. He is really quick to respond and he was very accommodating to my very late arrival.  I would stay here again!
12580274,75245629,2016-05-20,55715909,Sean,Best value near the airport. Recommended.
12580274,75722151,2016-05-22,44418564,Megan,"Ivan was very nice and welcoming and this place was as described. It was a small couch made into a bed in the living room area, but there was a privacy partition separating from the kitchen area. Was adequate for my layover. There is a free shuttle that takes you very close to the house, but I took a ~$5 / 10min uber each way because it was late at night and I am notoriously bad with directions. Check in (10pm) and out (8am) times are strict, which is fine, but good to know. If you are just looking for a place to be that is not the floor of the airport for your overnight layover, this works. However, $60 for a max of 10 hours on a couch seems steep to me. But it is the most reasonable and convenient option I could find in the area."
12580274,76992606,2016-05-30,74062866,P.J.,"Ivan was very friendly and hospitable. I was greeted with a smile, clean towels, and a bottle of water which I desperately needed. The walk to his house was approximately 5 minutes from the Airport stop on the Blue line of the T, and I felt safe walking into the neighborhood at night. This is a great place to stay if you have an early flight because of how close it is to the airport shuttle and the T."
12580274,78048507,2016-06-05,11609029,Mary,Ok for a few hours. Wished I didn't have to wait to get inside on a dark street that I was unfamiliar with while waiting for host . Maybe it was only 10 minutes but felt longer.
"Ivan was a good host though and place was really clean and he provided excellent information.\"",,,,,
12580274,78244089,2016-06-06,33273525,Hai,"Nice, friendly and helpful host. Very clean place and super easy to and from airport."
12580274,80377029,2016-06-17,30274289,Carlos,"Iván es un anfitrión de primera, tenía lista una toalla y agua en la cama donde dormiría. Todo muy limpio y con aire acondicionado. Lo recomendaría a cualquiera que quiera pasar una noche en Boston con bajo presupuesto, bien económico."
12580274,80523166,2016-06-18,67287408,Margrit,"Sehr nettes Willkommen, inkl. Schlüsselübergabe und einer Flasche Wasser."
Ich konnte dann auch schon eher einziehen,als ursprünglich gedacht.,,,,
Allerdings befindet sich das Schlafsofa in einem Raum,"der sonst als Physiotherapie-Praxis genutzt wird und nicht abgeschlossen ist. Nur ein Paravent trennt ihn von Flur und Küche. Allerdings befinden sich die anderen Wohnräume im Souterrain. Morgens wurde mir auch noch Tee angeboten. Insgesamt ein sehr netter Eindruck!\"",,,,
12580274,81335470,2016-06-22,66584715,Choonghwan,The host was nice and very responsive. The location is very close to the airport shuttle station.
12580274,81969347,2016-06-26,46679169,Susanne,"Ivan was a great host! Despite changing plans for my Boston stay, the communication was perfect and I would highly recommend him for stays in Boston near the airport."
12580274,82944101,2016-06-30,65747407,Alex,Ivan was helpful and very welcoming. Prior to booking we both exchanged messages about me being able to drop my things off which was really helpful for me as I would be traveling much. He was prompt when it came to communicating with me.
12580274,83220893,2016-07-01,65492726,Robert,"I've stayed with Ivan twice now, and both times were great. Perfect place to stay for a quick layover, and by far the best price for a room out there. Ivan is a great host and I highly recommend him."
12580274,84850924,2016-07-09,55941055,Keith,Ivan was a great host. Very helpful and easy going. Good communication. Clean place. I will stay there again. Boston is awesome!
12580274,86013414,2016-07-14,31991777,Seth,Great host and location!  Made this reservation at the last minute when my flight got cancelled and I needed to stay an extra night in Boston.  Ivan was very helpful!

12580274,90836701,2016-08-02,47745568,Si Mon',"As late as I came in that evening, Ivan was still available for any questions I had and walked me through the spaces I was able to use throughout the house. The picture displays a clean bed, with amenities including fresh towels and water, and that is what I came back to EVERY NIGHT. He was very generous with amenities and kept the space clean.  I enjoyed getting to talk to him personally and feeling like I was truly welcomed in his home. His house was close enough to the city for a $3 Uber ride, and close enough to the airport to make it there in 5 minutes. Great location, great accommodation, and really nice people. Experiences like these are why I love Airbnb!"
12580274,92319127,2016-08-08,9794313,Steven,"I felt Ivan did a great job communicating and the place is very close to the metro station. I was in town for school and just needed a place to sleep at night - and this room suited that perfectly. I think it's important to note that there are other AirBNB guests (which I was completely unaware of and accidentally took the other guests keys because I did not know). The room is basically a bed inside a massage parlor and it is right next to the front door - thus, any time another Airbnb guest arrived, left or used the bathroom, they will likely wake you up. If you are a hard sleeper and just want a place to crash for the night, then I'd recommend staying here."
12580274,92502713,2016-08-08,5203216,Louis,"Exactly as described. Super close to the airport, clean, part of a living room, and great valued. Perfect for a quick layover."
12580274,92667965,2016-08-09,21615812,Verena,"I arrived in the evening pretty upset because I had found out that my flight the next day got cancelled. Ivan was very concerned, responsive and helpful in this regard and I am very thankful. The place itself was fine, very clean and the bed was comfy. I slept great and the next morning I took the shuttle to the airport."

12580274,96629489,2016-08-23,90266847,Arsala,Great place to stay if you are looking for a nights rest. Very accommodating host and really close to the airport for those who've spent a long day of travel.
12580274,98357166,2016-08-30,36337615,Brendan,"If you'd rather not sleep in the terminal and not pay $200+ for a hotel room, Ivan's place is for you.  It's no frills, but a clean, safe, quiet place to crash in the event of a prolonged layover.  You don't even need to pay for a cab - take the airport shuttle to the Blue Line MBTA station, walk up the stairs to the Bremen St exit and a short walk through a park takes you to Brooks street and it's just another block up.  Very convenient - highly recommend if you need a good rest before your flight and on a budget!"
12580274,99360506,2016-09-04,87134266,Yiran,"it is a very clean  and nice place and very near to the subway station, convient to airport and city center. Ivan and his wife are very nice person."

The apt is in a pretty solid location and there was parking for our rental car.,,,,,

Only downside is it is managed through a third party,we had two guests and only one key and they were unable to get us a second key over the course of our four day stay which was disappointing.,,,,
Other than that,"a really nice place in a good area.\"",,,,
7573274,51166625,2015-10-18,10758510,Jeff,"Our stay was terrific and the accommodations were everything we expected them to be.

There were also tons of restaurants, bars, and great shopping nearby. The place was exactly as described and pictured in the photos and it was perfect for my friends and I. Emma was very quick to respond and helpful with any questions I had. I would definitely recommend staying here if you're headed to Boston."

8799256,56805051,2015-12-18,11709321,Jeremy,"Emma was an excellent host all the way through the process. Soon after I booked with Air BnB, Emma reached out with full and accurate details on how to acces the apartment. She checked in a couple times before checkin, just to make sure I had all the info I needed to get in the apartment."
The apartment itself is outstanding. Great location,literally seconds from the T. At first I was unsure about the specific spot,because of all the traffic and businesses in the area. But there was no problem whatsoever. The a building has a private and quiet entrance area,and the 5th floor elevation keeps you well away from the hustle and bustle of the street.,,
The apartment is clean,modern,and very cosmopolitan. There is a nice open feel,with a sitting area/TV room off the kitchen,where you could easily host a few friends for dinner and drinks. The 2 bedrooms are roomy,clean
And the view is fantastic,looking out over Boston Common,up onto the gold dome of the State House. It's great to wake up to that majestic view,and then just stroll out to a coffee shop or cafe for breakfast.,,
Great spot,"great value. I highly recommend this rental. You won't be disappointed.\"",,,,

8799256,57838658,2015-12-29,46479197,Patrick,"Emma was a very warm, welcoming, and efficient host.  This apartment was perfect for my family of four to explore Boston for a couple days.  It was very neat and tidy, comfortable, and nicely laid out with a somewhat Ikea-chic decor.  It has nice big windows and gets fantastic natural light.  Also, we loved that it has nice laminate flooring (no carpets) and was great for people with dust allergies.  The location is literally across the street from the Park Street T stop, five minutes from North Station on the Green Line.  The views of Boston Common from the apartment were great.  There are plenty of restaurants nearby and a nice little grocery store at the end of the block.  It is easy walking distance to any point in the North End, and we also walked to the Blue Man Group show."
We cooked french toast in the apartment and enjoyed hanging out in the apartment between excursions.  All beds were very comfortable,including the convertible couch.  There is some traffic noise at night/early morning,but it did not prevent us from getting a good night's sleep.  The building itself is extremely quiet,tidy,and feels secure with multiple layers of keyed access required.  Trash,recycling
Again,in case you forgot by now,Emma was a great host.  You can tell she cares and wants your stay to be great.,,,

8799256,63243485,2016-02-21,33586118,Carlos,Amazing host! The apartment is literally perfect and right in front of boston common and the green and red line! You can't go wrong with this host and this apartment!
8799256,64086909,2016-02-29,16538254,Carlos,"The location of this apartment is awesome! It has a great view of the Boston Commons.  And more importantly, the subway station is right outside the door ready to take all over town (or the east coast)."
The apartment itself is spacious and clean. Our host,Emma,"was helpful and replied back to any inquiries very fast which made the stay enjoyable. Would definitely book again! \"",,,
8799256,64613198,2016-03-06,55455907,Audrey,"This was a perfect place to stay for our wedding weekend in Boston. It was very clean when we walked in, the entry process was easy, and the full size (not queen) beds were comfy."
It was a little chilly first walking in with the heat off,but the heat kicked on quickly.,,,,
The view was amazing.,,,,,
The street sounds were loud for being on an upper level,but that's a city.,,,,
All in all,"a great place to stay.\"",,,,

8799256,65034613,2016-03-10,18993625,Heather,"Emma gave us great information about her apartment - everything was as she said it would be.  The location is ideal. It is just across from the Park Street T station and within easy walking distance to Back Bay, Beacon Hill, the Financial District, Faneuil Hall and more.  I would definitely stay here again!"
8799256,65545585,2016-03-15,27171872,Leslie Ann,"Our flight came in at 6am and Emma allowed us to check into the apartment really early around 7:30am. The apartment is located on a main St which is conveniently located next to the subway, train and bus station. We were able to drop off our luggage and fresh up before sightseeing. The apartment is very clean and has all the necessities like a fully stocked kitchen and TV must haves like Roku. The two bedroom space was spacious! The views of Boston Common and the State House were breathtaking! The pictures do not do this place justice. It was so much more beautiful than we expected. The toilet broke during our 2nd day and all we had to do was txt Emma and she had someone fix it right away. The area is walking distance from all the tourist areas. It is an ideal space for people on business or first timers to Boston. Since the apartment is located in the heart of downtown Boston, it is not the quietest but the location is totally worth it. Emma was great and was readily available if I had any questions. I would definitely use this AirBnb again! Loved it!"
8799256,65828153,2016-03-17,40341678,Dean,"This is a great apartment, and given the opportunity I would stay there again. Excellent views over the Boston Common, close to transport (literally a 1 min walk) and a spacious, well appointed apartment. Couldn't ask for much more."
8799256,66384767,2016-03-22,6554894,Danielle,"The place is perfectly located right off a metro stop with an amazing view of the capital. We were able to walk all across town on hop on the subway when needed. Easy to find and worked great for our vacation with two couples as be both got our own room. We did not get the chance to meet Emma, but she sent great instructions ahead of time so we knew where we were going. Thanks for the great stay!"
8799256,66882771,2016-03-25,55168726,Karin,"Das Appartement von Emma liegt wirklich sehr zentral am Boston Common, so dass man Boston wunderbar zu Fuß besichtigen kann."
Emma hat uns vorab eine sehr gute Beschreibung geschickt,wie wir in das Appartement und an die Schlüssel kommen. Das hat wunderbar geklappt.,,,,
Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und auch zu fünft bietet sie genug Platz,um sich wohl zu fühlen. Die Küche ist mit den wesentlichen Dingen ausgestattet,um sich ein Frühstück zu machen,für die Zubereitung einer warmen Mahlzeit eignet sie sich nicht.,,
Leider haben wir Emma nicht persönlich kennen gelernt,da sie verreist war. Trotzdem war sie über SMS zu erreichen,so dass sie auf unsere Fragen während des Aufenthalts eingehen konnte.,,,
"Wir würden jeder Zeit wieder in ihr Appartement gehen und gerne werden wir es weiter empfehlen.\"",,,,,
8799256,67504946,2016-03-29,179615,Tim,"I stayed at Emma's place with my two teenage sons. The location is the biggest positive--the green and red lines are literally across the street, the state capital across the Common and the North End a short walk. The apartment itself was clean neat and, as the photos accurately represent, without any charm. The kitchen is functional but not well equipped--I was surprised not to find toaster. Directly in front of the building feels a bit skid row, but safe. I wouldn't book this for a romantic getaway, but as a convenient place to stay in heart of Boston it is fine."
8799256,67833419,2016-03-31,52023701,Charles-Louis,"Great apartment, very bright, clean and convenient, with a GORGEOUS view of Boston Commons and Downtown! Across the street from the Gardens, 2 min walk from grocery stores, 30 seconds walk from a T station, this is a fantastic location! Ideal for stays (I was in Boston for a conference)."
8799256,68298615,2016-04-04,12191704,Jeff,"An overall very good experience, and I would definitely stay here again. The apartment is exactly as Emma describes it (maybe even better). Location is wonderful, and public transportation is very accessible. Plenty of easy eating and grocery options nearby. Easy checkin instructions, and clear directions for getting to the apartment from the airport. Clean space. My two friends and I loved staying here."
Even though the location is outstanding for getting around,the immediate neighborhood is a bit sketchy after dark,but there are lots of people around. I was very aggressively approached by someone on the street as I left the building once so I would just make sure you're with someone if you are out real late at night.,,,
I stayed here with two other people,and we all had plenty of room. I slept on the pullout couch,and it was comfortable enough. Of course,being in such a prime location,there was a bit of street noise and light pollution that I could have done without,but the trade off for the location was worth it in my opinion.
There were not enough dish towels and hand towels so if that is a thing for you,heads up.,,,,
I would recommend this spot,though,to anyone coming to Boston. I enjoyed hanging out in the apartment,"and I enjoyed how easy it was to get what I needed during my stay. Emma is a flexible and welcoming host and provided clear instructions for what was expected. She is super easy to work with and provides quick communication.\"",,
8799256,68832503,2016-04-07,2097093,Amanda,"Emma's apartment was absolutely beautiful! Extremely spacious, an absolutely gorgeous view of the Boston Common, and centrally located in an awesome part of town. Lots of great hotels, bars, restaurants, historical sights, and shopping all within walking distance. It was perfect for my short stay and with the T station literally right outside the front door, made it super easy for me to see Boston and the surrounding areas (Cambridge, etc.) when I was in the mood to venture out. I would absolutely stay here again!"
8799256,70799422,2016-04-20,45542506,Jennifer,"Emma's place is great! If you want to be in the heart of the Commons her place is the best. The view of the capital building is amazing, I sometimes thought I could touch it from the window. The place is clean with 2 bedrooms and a fold out couch.  Directions from Emma was simple and public transportation is right out the front door. If and when we are in Boston again, hopefully we will be so lucky to stay at Emma's.  Thank you Emma."
8799256,71235735,2016-04-24,48396912,Anna,"The apartment was clean and the view is beautiful in the living room and main bedroom. Everything exactly as described. Lots of great food in the area, shopping around the corner, and a 10 minute walk to South Station."
8799256,72909616,2016-05-05,47485456,Bron,"The apartment was clean and nicely furnished.  The location is super for catching the T-line and for getting to nearby shops like Macy's and Roche Brothers for food.  Great to have the common close by.  We stayed with our kids (5 and 7) and found the apartment comfortable and perfect for our needs.  There are definitely some strange characters hanging around at times, but we were not bothered or harassed.  When we had a question Emma was quick to respond and that was appreciated.  I would stay in the apartment again if I was in Boston.  The view is great too."
8799256,73225203,2016-05-07,30812029,Judy,"The apartment was clean and styled nicely. It was convenient to access the public transit system across the street. The only things were that the temperature in each of the rooms varied (it was very cold in the living room, but very hot in the rooms themselves) and the vent made loud noises at night. Overall, good experience but wish it was a more comfortable stay."
8799256,74893278,2016-05-17,30180886,David,"Emma is good at responding your concern. When the AC is down, she immediately put someone to install a portable AC. But unfortunately the AC does not really work."
8799256,75269407,2016-05-20,61582187,Kevin,"The listing description was very accurate. The apartment was clean and came with all of the necessities as listed, our family of 5 had a great time staying there. The location of the apartment was extremely convenient, allowing us to walk to many places around Boston without feeling exhausted. Overall, the apartment was great. All of Emma's instructions and requirements were clear and helpful, definitely a great place for a short (or long) stay in Boston."
8799256,78367514,2016-06-06,58212273,Ursula,The apartment is very well located for sightseeing. It was very clean. I will rent it again when I‘m in Boston next time. One room has no windows so we slept on the livingroom sofabed- no problem.
8799256,80061114,2016-06-15,57948515,Matthew,"Although the location was central and convenient, the apartment was scarcely appointed. I would recommend upgrading the beds, as sleeping on futon style mattresses was extremely uncomfortable. I felt that for the price, we would have been better off staying at a hotel."
8799256,82795591,2016-06-29,8242768,Rachel Hjert,Great host ... Yes very good for all would stay here again ... Love the park view. Very convenient ... Everyone was lovely.
8799256,84139630,2016-07-05,58575560,Alex,"Terrific apartment. Terrific location—literally directly across the street from the Boston Common and Park Street T station. Can be a bit noisy from typical city street noise, but you expect that given the location. Emma was incredibly responsive during our stay when we had questions—which didn't happen often because Emma has considered nearly all the details. Highly recommend. Enjoy!"
8799256,84774371,2016-07-09,11969734,Carla,Nice stay at this spacious apartment.  The location is unbeatable. Would stay here again.

9541295,61382466,2016-02-03,54889795,Sarah,"I booked this apartment for a client, so I did not stay at the apartment - however, I will say that my client was very pleased with the apartment. Also, I found dealing with Adam and his team very easy - they were very professional, and quick to respond to inquiries. The information they sent about arrival/departure was clear and easy to follow."
9541295,62707744,2016-02-16,12855927,Boyan,This apartment was absolutely excellent in every way -- and delivered above and beyond expectations.
Location: Very close to both the Berkeley College of Music and Northeastern -- for anyone visiting family/friends that are students there,this place is for you.,,,,
Service: The concierges are very pleasant to deal with and get things done quickly -- thank you Charlotte and Isais!,,,,,
Cleanliness: Squeeky clean.,,,,,
Amenities: Both TVs had full cable and Netflix capabilities (nice touch!). The bed and fold out were both extremely comfortable and there is ample light leading into the apartment. The temperature regulation was also very simple. And finally,a portable Bose speaker was available to play music from your smartphone.,,,,
Overall: An excellent find,will definitely use this place when I come back.,,,,

9541295,66172691,2016-03-20,44114523,James,Great Location and the concierge was very helpful. The apartment was clean and a good size. Overall very good experience.
9541295,69217093,2016-04-10,11633572,Tracy,"This apartment was absolutely gorgeous. I very much enjoyed my stay here as it was located right by Boylston and Mass Ave. There are several restaurants across the street. It's steps to the Hynes Convention Center T on the Green Line and 10 min from the Mass Ave Orange Line. Check in was easy and there are free laundry machines on the top floor. This came in very handy on rainy day. Hooray for dry clothes! :) The office staff was very friendly and could answer any questions that I have.  I would like to give one heads up. And this is at no fault of the apartment. Because this is located on a busy street, you'll hear the cars going by and honking their horns at all hours. Honestly, that's what should be expected when located on a bustling street. But just wanted to put that out there for the light sleepers."
9541295,70227839,2016-04-17,59745074,Morris,"The apartments are brand-spanking new, in a great location (near everything and the subway), with a cute cafe right across the street. I would request a high floor Boylston Ave facing unit, because the back unit faces the parking lot and highway. Even with that less-than-stellar view, though, the first floor back unit we had was bright and quiet (no street noise). The bed was comfortable. The bathroom has its own heater. The TVs are nice."
9541295,72259496,2016-05-01,25946732,Viral,"The unit was clean, well furnished, and felt like home when I arrived. I enjoyed my stay in Boston, especially due to this awesome unit."
9541295,77784932,2016-06-03,3521887,Dr Jaclyn,"We  enjoyed our stay at this apartment. The communication was excellent, and the kitchen had everything you needed. The apartment is located on Bolyston St, and we found it easy to different locations around boston and back bay. As mentioned by other reviews, the traffic is a little noisy, so not great if you are a light sleeper, but we found it okay. Would definitely recommend this place."
9541295,78878391,2016-06-09,25371505,Andrew,Great location 1 block from T.  Clean and modern.  Well-equipped.  Will stay here again.
9541295,80065641,2016-06-16,55949862,Ivica,"Had a pleasant stay, transfer of keys to the apartment went very smoothly, the concierge was friendly and helpful. The apartment was very clean and had a nice decor. The location of the apartment building is terrific, very close to the Berklee College of Music and only a 5 min walk to the Hynes convention center."
One thing that is worth noting however: The bedroom window of the apartment was facing the Turnpike,which means that traffic sounds -- especially when freight trains are passing by -- can be heard; but didn't bother me too much.,,,,
Late checkout was not a problem,"which happened to be very helpful.\"",,,,
9541295,82536576,2016-06-28,33801300,Sara,The place was exactly as pictured and in a great location!  Everything was brand new and clean and we very much enjoyed our stay!
9541295,84979203,2016-07-10,46971458,Lori,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here!  The apartment was clean, well organized and very comfortable.  The neighborhood is great, with lots of restaurants and a Whole Foods and Trader Joes just a short walk away.  The T stop is just around the corner, but we loved walking down to the Boston Commons as well.  The roof deck made for a lovely way to watch the sunsets.  We will definitely stay here again if back in Boston."
9541295,87719483,2016-07-21,5270447,Sean,"The Good- The luxury 1 bed apt at ARTlab was quite nice and is well described by the photos. It is just a 5-minute walk to the Hynes convention center and you are in a wonderful part of Boston, located near many attractions. The company left a few snacks on the table and some coffee in the cupboard. The mattress was soft and comfortable. Even though the bedroom faced East, there was a nice room darkening shade to let one sleep in the morning."
To Note - this is a furnished,"business apartment that is being listed on AirBnB by a commercial company. It is not a \"\"traditional\"\" AirBnB",where a private individual is renting out their spare bedroom or apartment. Also,the AirBnB listing did not include a cleaning fee but there is a cleaning fee if you do not clean. I am used to leaving AirBnB  places clean but have never cleaned the bathroom,the kitchen and vacuumed the floor before leaving a place (and now have to wait up to 7 days to see if I will be assessed a fee). Again,this policy just needs to be listed in the ad.
The Bad - My largest complaint was the noise. I've lived in NYC and DC but some of these apartments are directly above a parking lot and I-70. Multiple nights I was awoken at 3 or 4am in the morning to the sounds of continuous honking for several minutes (not just a single honk but of some person laying on the horn). I am not a light sleeper,especially in the middle of the night,but could not sleep through the noise outside. With better windows,this place would be a strong recommend and some nights were fine. Also,"I'm also guessing that I got unlucky as there were some units that were on the other side of the building that are probably much quieter. Bring ear plugs regardless.\"",
9541295,91715378,2016-08-06,6682984,David,"It was clean and comfy. And, a fantastic location for attending the Berklee School of Music. Perfect. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The concierges who ran the front desk were great. Easy, friendly, and genuinely helpful. We'll be back. As a perk, its a 2 min walk to Fenway Victory Garden, an amazingly beautiful group of personal gardens that dazzled both me and my 14 year old. Anyway,... Thanks a lot. David"
179244,507142,2011-09-06,914731,Cristina,"We enjoyed our stay at Hermina's. The location is very good for the price, the access to down-town is easy. The 2 bedroom townhouse was perfect for us, as we traveled with kids and friends. In the evening, when we were arriving from our down-town tours, we enjoyed the living room and the kitchen for our late dinners.  Herrmina was out of town, but the friend who replaced her was very helpful and kind, quickly responded to our needs and gave us good tips to make the most of our stay. This way we discovered the beautiful beaches which are only a few minutes drive from Hermina's house. We are happy that we had the opportunity to play in the sand and even swim."
"We'll keep Hermina in mind for our next stay in Boston and we'll gladly recommend her to our friends.\"",,,,,
179244,530699,2011-09-14,663796,Ellie,"It was convenient to have the small Apt 2 to ourselves, but this apartment seems far less comfortable and welcoming than the main house, so we spent as little time there as possible. It had not been properly cleaned before we got there, though the person acting for Hermina was willing to clean it again if we wanted."

There was some confusion about the reservation,but after discussing with the host,misunderstanding was cleared.,,,
We thought parking was inside the property,but we had to park in the street. It was not a problem.,,,,

179244,622623,2011-10-12,990642,Maya,My family and I stayed in Hermina's 2 bedroom townhouse and really enjoyed it.  It was a perfect space for what we were looking for.  The location in its proximity to the red line T stop was incredibly convenient. Hermina is very friendly and it was great having a chance to chat with her as well.  I would definitely recommend her home to my friends!
179244,637347,2011-10-17,1192898,Valerie,"The condo was definitely nice and Hermina was a wonderful host!  It was very convenient from the Subway (a quick 5 min walk) and there was internet and TV available and breakfast in the fridge (english muffins, cereal, milk, and OJ).  Hermina was very responsive and easy to reach via e-mail and phone, so thank you Hermina!  It was my first time using AirBNB so getting to talk to her before I arrived helped to ease my worries.   Only reason why I would not rate it 5 stars was that the neighborhood is not the safest.   It's a good thing the Condo is located right next to the police station.  We didn't have any trouble, so I was thankful to have a place to stay and a warm roof over my head.  Overall, it was a positive experience."
179244,659033,2011-10-24,1233218,Michael,"Hermina provided a lovely townhouse apartment for me and my friend, Debbie. She was accomodating and had a lot of little extras, fresh fruit, cereal, etc."

179244,667351,2011-10-26,1304933,Claudia,"There is not enough space here to say all the wonderful things about staying with Hermina. She is a tremendously gracious host and makes you feel right at home. She will sit with you for breakfast (or margaritas), invite you for tea and make you feel like you're part of an extended (often international) family. She even went so far as to invite me to a dinner party she was hosting for friends in the main house where she cooked delicious Armenian meals. It was an absolute delight!"

179244,741604,2011-11-24,466579,Irme,"Four of us had the whole townhouse to ourselves! It was perfect with big beds for all of us. Hermina was very accommodating in every way including bed types, arrival and departure times."
The apartment is located a stone's throw from Fields Corner station on the red line in a very safe neighbourhood probably because there is a police department right behind the house. An American Food Basket supermarket was located in the shopping plaza a block away where there is also a very well stocked liquor store,and a Family Dollar discount store. There are late-night Chinese food takeout places and Hi-Fi pizza around the corner.,,,,
The apartment is well stocked with everything you might need but again,there's the Family Dollar you can go to for toiletries if you didn't bring any. Coin laundry machines in the basement,a flat screen tv with dvd player,full kitchen,lots of windows and natural light round out this home.,

179244,855961,2012-01-10,1572021,Katharina,it was amazing to stay in Herminas house! :-)
she's very nice and the house was just awesome. big rooms and everything you need. the stay there made our trip to Boston so enjoyable -,,,,,
"Thank you Hermina!!\"",,,,,
179244,878282,2012-01-23,1549593,Heather,"Hermina was very kind to me and my two small children.  We stayed in the townhouse for about a week and were comfortable there.  It is not fancy, but it is a very pleasant space with plenty of light.  Hermina told me she was about to paint the rooms, which should be lovely when they are done. There is a subway stop about 2 blocks away and I felt reasonably comfortable in the neighborhood. I did not have any trouble parking on the street."
179244,1040891,2012-03-25,1221354,Naomi,"Can't beat the price.  I basically needed a place to sleep.  Hermina left cookies on the table, and provided coffee and a continental breakfast.  I slept well and would definately go there again."
179244,1045125,2012-03-26,1418524,Lon,"Hermina was very friendly and helpful.  The apartment was clean and nicely decorated.  There was a second bedroom, but no one else was there during my stay.  There was also a nice living room with a couch and TV.  It was also just a short walk to a T stop on the Red Line (the subway).  Overall, quite nice for the price and location, in Boston."
179244,1096523,2012-04-08,1701457,Daniel,"L'appartement de Hermina est tres bien situé, proche d'une ligne de métro traversant boston et nous permettant de rejoindre très facilement et rapidement tous les points d'intérêts. C'est très spacieux, confortable et très bien équipé."
"Hermina s'inquiete de savoir si l'on était bien installé et est tres sympathique. C'est une adresse que je recommande \"",,,,,
179244,1106126,2012-04-10,277646,Lance,"We arrived late at night, but Hermina gave great directions and we had no trouble finding and getting into the apartment. The front door and first floor living area is shared with another private room; we ended up having the place to ourselves but weren't sure of it until the next day. Accommodations were overall a good value."

179244,1334045,2012-05-23,1733292,Ifran,"The location was very easy to get to using the subway system. Upon arrival, the residence was clean and tidy with fresh linens and towels. The kitchen was also well stocked with all needed cooking utensils, as well as breakfast foods."
179244,1380372,2012-05-29,1630723,Regina,"My husband and I stayed at Hermina's place for a night during Memorial Day weekend. She has a guest house with two rooms. Since we were the only ones staying, she gave us the bigger room with a king size bed. Her place was lovely. She provided us with clean sheets and towels and the fridge was stocked with a few things for our use. She also let us check-in early which was very much appreciated since our bags were heavy. Although I enjoyed our stay, I think it could've been cleaner. The bathroom looked like it wasn't cleaned after a guest stayed there. Also, the rooms have no AC. This wasn't a problem for us since it was chilly that night but the ceiling fan kept making a ticking noise so we had to turn it off."
Overall,"I think I will stay here again since it was so convenient to the train station and we got to downtown Boston in less than 15 mins. Thank you Hermina!\"",,,,
179244,1489317,2012-06-16,1830009,Silke,"Hermina was a very nice host. Sadly, I must say, that the room and the bathroom weren´t clean. Specially in our room, I found toenails from another person, these nails followed me all the 5 days. The bed is not really suitable for two adult persons."

179244,5165332,2013-06-16,4418605,Elizabeth,My sister and I had a good stay. Very close to public transportation. Easy directions provided. So it was easy to get in to the main city area and everything in the house was clean and comfortable. It is also right on top of a police station making it very safe.
179244,5423513,2013-06-29,4463912,Trevor,"Very comfortable house not too far out of the city. Not the best looking neighborhood, but far cheaper than staying downtown. Hermina was very professional and logistics were made quite easy."

clean,organized,comfortable place.,,,
"Hermina is such a sweet host. she took care of everything during th stay. felt like home. :-)\"",,,,,
179244,7276210,2013-09-14,7536712,Steve,"It is true that Hermina is a nice lady and offers helpful informaton. But the Beautiful Townhouse or Beautiful Victorian House is an exaggeration.  This is an old old house in a rundown old part of Dorchester, south Boston.  The interior was spartan but adequate. The sheets were old and threadworn and just lying on the Kingsize bed, which took up all of the room. The front lawn was ragged. The house badly needs painting, which Hermina is trying to do but the contractor is not performing. It is right next door to a Boston Police Substation, so you can feel safe.  We shared the two bedroom one bath apt with a nice young couple from France.. Sorry to be negative, but when my wife saw the neighborhood as we got near to the place, she didn't even want to go inside. I talked with Hermina and encouraged her to keep up the maintenance on the exterior of the house"
179244,7408159,2013-09-18,8323863,Marjan,"A really good startingpoint to visit Boston as it's close to the metro. Hermina is very nice and helpfull. Also very flexibel: arriving early was no problem, so we could spend an extra day in boston."
179244,8142973,2013-10-17,2245427,Nina,"The townhouse is exactly as pictured.  Neighborhood was a bit more run down but not so bad.  But since her home is near a commuter train, there is absolutely no parking anywhere close by during the day.  We drove up a little before 5 pm and the streets were so packed, that someone was blocking her tiny driveway.  After waiting 5-10 minutes, commuters from the train were getting into their cars and opened some spots."
Also,she needs to disclose her house rules on the website.  I understand people work and all,but sending guests detailed rules like they need to change the bed linens when they leave,after she accepted payment,"was ridiculous.  I stripped the bed but it made me skeptical as to how clean the sheets that I slept on actually were.  : (   \"",
179244,8183925,2013-10-19,9454872,Matt,Fine clean house.

179244,8323459,2013-10-25,9584416,Sam,"Great location, HUGE bed, overall very comfortable place to stay with a plethora of dive bars surrounding."
179244,8494037,2013-11-02,8370214,Emily,"First time to Boston and we had a great time. The apartment was beautiful and very large. No one else had booked a stay while we were there, so we had the entire two bedroom two story apartment to ourselves. Huge bed and clean bathrooms! She provided us with maps and give us recommendations to places to see. The place is located in the south side, so you're not in the heart of Boston but you are right next to the railway, as well as a police station which is comforting. All and all, we would totally stay here again."
179244,8866566,2013-11-22,2429825,Jennifer,"Staying with Hermina was fantastic! I had a two bedroom flat all to myself since no one else booked the other room. I also got sick during my trip and asked to stay another night. Her friend Donna brought me orange juice, bananas and English muffins!! This made my day as I came down with something that incapacitated me for a day. The apartment is super clean and check in was easy. Hermina was not there but the instructions were in the reservations. It was a great experience - and super affordable!"
179244,9878331,2014-01-16,10768945,Ruthie,"While I did not meet either of them, Hermina and Donna were very accommodating. The house was very nice and so was our room. I had read from other people's reviews that the area was not the safest, and I would definitely agree. I was hesitant to walk around at night because of that. However, having the police station behind the house was comforting. Overall, I would say that the room was a great deal based on its location (next to the T), the free parking, and the beautiful space."
179244,10576313,2014-02-25,11234766,Susan,"We had a lovely comfortable stay in the apartment -- beds were great, all was well, Hermina was lovely -- and assistant Donna went above and beyond the call of duty -- thank you!!!"
"\"",,,,,
179244,12520737,2014-05-04,14949013,Monica,"Although my boyfriend and I didn't meet Hermina, or her house manager Donna, everything went (almost) perfectly! After booking the room I quickly received all of the information I would need for our first Airbnb experience."
"We drove up from New York and arrived around 3pm. Upon arrival we called Donna and she gave us the code to get in and let us know to call her if we \"\"needed anything at all\"\"! The apartment (#2 in the townhouse) was clean and bright. We were greeted by fresh fruit and english muffins. It was very homey and we had pretty much anything we would need!",,,,,
We stayed in room G,which had a king size bed,as well as extra blankets and a yoga ball in the closet! Ha. The location was great as it was barely two blocks from the red line or the bus. We were right next to a police station,so we weren't concerned for our safety,and found on-street parking very easily. The night was great!,
The next morning however,we were woken up to knocking on the [bedroom] door from another couple whom had booked the apt. This was at 8am,and let me remind you,we're on vacation. Donna had supposedly given them the wrong room number at first,"but then had given them access to the apt in which we were staying and told them to \"\"go in","no one's there\"\". It would have been fine sharing the place had we 1) been aware of it 2) not gotten woken up so early. It felt as though because another party checked in much earlier than they were supposed to"
Overall the experience was a good one! I would definitely recommend Airbnb and Hermina's home to anyone. If we're ever in Boston we would absolutely stay again. Mistakes happen,"it was just unfortunate that it happened on our first night of our first Airbnb. \"",,,,
179244,13332901,2014-05-25,15758305,Weining,Comfortable stay at Hermina's! Place was in good condition and she gives very detailed instructions to help you settle in and get to the metro station.
179244,13726253,2014-06-02,16111526,Lindy,"Wonderful experience! Hermina herself wasn't around, but Donna showed up right after I called her. There was a slight confusion about the rooms, but it was solved quickly and there were no real issues about that. Donna is extremely helpful and a wonderful person who I am very glad to have met! I definitely recommend that all guests say hello!"
In the morning,the person I was staying with and I made ourselves a very nice breakfast with some eggs another guest had left. The kitchen (in apartment 2) had all the equipment we could have possibly wanted to use.  We felt very comfortable and at home in the apartment.,,,,
Apparently,"some people think the Dorchester area is a \"\"bad area\"\" or something (we had no idea",as we're not from new england),but Donna assured us that she had lived in Dorchester for a long time and thought much of that reputation was the product of exaggeration. Additionally,the Police Station is literally behind the house. We could see a bunch of parked cop cars in the police lot from our window. So no reason for alarm if that's a concern for you potential future guests!,
I would highly recommend staying here to anyone looking for a place in the Boston area! In fact,I will probably choose to stay here again myself! Great price,excellent quality!,,,
Bonus: while making breakfast,"a momma cat was cleaning four of the cutest kittens we have ever seen just out the kitchen window!\"",,,,
179244,14140960,2014-06-12,6340779,Ramon,Great place! Our room was very clean and very spacious. We basically had the house to ourselves in our stay in Boston. She is very quick to respond as well. The place is not in the heart of Boston but the metro is a quick walk away.

179244,15165718,2014-07-03,17223548,Arun,"The room was beautiful.  The furniture is all polished wood, and in general the house is comforting.  The townhouse is used as series of guest rooms, and there is laundry and kitchen access."
Hermina is the owner,and was traveling in Europe at the time of my stay.  She wasn't able to respond to my messages before I arrived.  I needed to ask another resident to put me in touch with Donna,who helps maintain the property.,,,
Donna was gracious and prompt in giving me the necessary details.  Afterwards Hermina contacted me and was apologetic and sincere.  The accommodations are excellent,"and I would gladly stay again.\"",,,,

From start to finish Hermina and her assistant, Donna, were communicative, helpful and available to make us feel welcome and answer any questions.  The house is in a diverse neighborhood that made us feel at home and like we got to see another real slice of Boston we would have missed if staying in the city center.  The T subway is literally a 4 minute walk away and you are in downtown in 10 minutes.  A cab home will cost about $16.  Expect a comfortable, clean, safe, air and light filled home with WIFI, laundry and a banana, toast and coffee in the morning : )  You can spend what you would have on something fancy instead on enjoying Boston!"

We were 2 days in Hermina´s house,all perfect,the house is as described,"a big bed and a perfect room. The neightbourhood seems very quite. The subway is 4 minutes far and you arrives in 15-20 minutes to the city center. Totally recomended.\"",,

An older part of town, but safe with a police station in your backyard. The place was no frills but great for a short stay; it had everything we needed. Hermina and Donna were very friendly and hospitable."

179244,28493356,2015-03-24,6120512,Dana,The location is okay; it's just around the corner from a T stop and on the red line to boot. Just a few stops to Boston Common. Dorchester is not in the high rent district but I didn't feel unsafe walking back and for the to the T. I was lucky and had the suite to myself as the other room was not rented. Hermina does have a good system in place; you don't need a key to get in the front door (key pad) and the house is divided up in such a way as to provide a good level of privacy.
Hermina's house was adequate,but not more than that. There was nobody to greet me when I arrived,"and I had some difficulty reaching someone to assist me. The house is not \"\"beautiful\"\"; it is stocked with mismatched furniture",mismatched bedding and linens,and mismatched dishes and silverware. This is more frat house than guest house. It's a bit dilapidated (the window A/C unit in my room had a blanket over it that was taped to the window,I assume to reduce draft) and the parking situation is not great. I'm not warning anyone off of staying here but don't expect anything fancy
179244,32304623,2015-05-16,25801259,Jay-Ar,I had a great stay! The place was beautiful and very clean. Hermina was a great host! Will definitely be recommending this place for other travelers!
179244,39552550,2015-07-24,38352485,Taylor,"I only spent one night at Hermina's townhouse, but found it to be very enjoyable! The room was spacious with a large bed and a window AC unit, which kept the temperature comfortable. The townhouse was very clean and was a short walk to the nearest T station. The townhouse was approximately 15 minutes from downtown via the red line, which made for convenient travel. The area around the T station was a little odd, but I did not have any problems. I would definitely recommend this location to friends and other travelers!"

The downstairs shared living area and kitchen was also very clean and very pleasant and spacious.  The room itself was great, a clean bed, adequate lighting, a table, chair, and good-sized closet.  The entire place was very pleasant and made us want to stay longer.  I appreciated how clean everything was, too.  The home is next to a police station, which provided an extra sense of safety.

We never saw Hermina or anyone else in person.  It would have helped us if someone were there to give us a quick orientation.  We couldn't figure out how to shut off the ceiling fan without shutting off the ceiling light.  We also could not figure out how to turn on the TV, even though we tried for 10 minutes.  It would have been nice to have had some face towels and hand towels as well.  The neighborhood was a little rough-around-the-edges, but conveniently close to downtown."

13993185,98113868,2016-08-29,59937630,Stefano,"Beacon Hill is a beautiful district in the Boston downtown, at a walk distance from the Boston common, the state house and the metro station."
The flat is beautiful as well and  it has been recently renovated. The private entrance provides access to the dining room located in the basement,so that it's windows are at the street level.,,,,
"The double bedroom is small but tidy with a window on an internal courtyard.\"",,,,,

"Muy bien equipado. La encargada de la localidad (Anita) fue muy amable y pronta a resolver cualquier eventualidad.\"",,,,,
13926017,93125001,2016-08-11,28642586,Karen,"I felt very fortunate to have found this listing because it was very close to nearly everything in downtown Boston. It's right across from the Common Park and very close to the metro. The metro wasn't even necessary because everything was within walking distance. The apartment itself is wonderful because it has air conditioning (which is great for the summer heat and humidity). It has a full kitchen with everything you need to cook, games to play, and a TV. I had a very relaxing vacation there and I would definitely come back! I also appreciated how accommodating the host was in letting me drop off my luggage before the check-in time. Thank you!"
13926017,95231004,2016-08-18,27699168,Emily & Stephen,"The apartment was sufficient for the 12 hours we were there. Great location--walking distance to bars and restaurants. The host wasn't in town, but the cleaning staff let us in to the apartment. The only odd takeaway from the apartment was the leftover food and beverages in the fridge (half drank bottle of milk, etc)--maybe they thought other guests would use them. I'd recommend this apartment for a quick stopover in Boston."
13800294,84464282,2016-07-07,76812673,Priscilla,"It was an amazing experience. Carlos was very nice. The apartment was very clean and looked like the pictures. He gave us the key,received our packages when we were out and helped us with our luggage. Thanks Carlos!"
13800294,92749634,2016-08-09,47724663,Lev,"Carlos is a very nice person.  He helped us to bring our luggage to our room and when we leaved to the car.  The Place is clean and exactly as on the picture, very cozy.  No air condition, but had a fan.  The problem with this place is no parking close to this street. We have to park at Woodland Station all our trip and use Subway to go to Boston."

Lovely neighborhood and very good restaurants around (I strongly suggest the cuban !!). I really liked it and would consider to get back there, one day"
4767023,43827551,2015-08-22,13316476,Pat,"We were made to feel very welcome in this lovely family home so full of character in Jamaica Plain in Boston.  The host seemed to think of everything we might need (including the wifi code!), supplied us with excellent information about the house, the neighbourhood and suggestions of things to do in Boston, and checked in with us a number of times to make sure we were OK.  The neighbours were friendly and helpful. The house is very close to the subway - so quick access into Boston centre, and there are shops and restaurants close by. An excellent choice by us for our short stay in Boston and we would highly recommend it to other airbnb-ers."
4767023,48572132,2015-09-27,9923644,Corentin,"Minor's home was great! It is very spacious and very quiet. He was easy to communicate with, left great instructions and and we had provided some breakfast items including coffee. It is a short walk to the metro and not long at all to arrive to downtown Boston. We were very happy with our stay, thank you!"
4767023,55237450,2015-11-29,30982632,Isabel,"Minor provided us with all the necessary information about the house, the neighborhood and the city. He left breakfast for us  in the fridge and really let to our disposal his home, which is very cozy. He is also very accessible and the communication is easy and immediate."
4767023,58203343,2016-01-01,14489367,Dalia,Minor's place was great! Accurately described- great for a family.
4767023,84080035,2016-07-05,30176605,Mary Beth,"Our family (2 adults, 2 kids and a dog) stayed here for a wedding in Boston. Minor checked in with us before we arrived and reminded us how to get into the house. It was a great location for us and a very nice home. It was the first time we had stayed in an Airbnb that is otherwise lived in by the host family, so that took a little getting used to, but it is a nice place with a very pleasant back deck and sleeping areas. I wouldn't recommend for small children because of the steep stairs, but great for families with older kids. It was especially nice to have a dog-friendly spot!"
4767023,85632036,2016-07-12,16394769,Dana,"Minor was very good at getting back to me about our booking and asking if there was anything else we needed to make our stay more comfortable. The house has loads of space, a big kitchen to cook in (which we did with joy) and a lovely deck with a beautiful garden. Upstairs in the master bedroom tea and coffee making facilities were provided which was a nice touch as the bedroom is on the 3rd level so we could easily make a tea without needing to go downstairs. Most importantly the master bed was soooo comfortable!"
This area of Jamaica Plain is a cultural melting pot that has a good vibe,I can tell it's slowly becoming a trendier spot than what it use to be.,,,,
"All in all a good stay.\"",,,,,
4767023,96694542,2016-08-24,12958071,Philippe,The house was well situated and perfect for our family. Minor was very very nice and we enjoyed our stay very  much.
4767023,97597735,2016-08-28,6296403,Kim,"Minor's house is quite large and comfortable.  There are restaurants and supermarket nearby for shopping and eating out.  Our family of four has enough room to spread out.  The big plus is there is parking for our car, a rare find in the city of Boston.  Minor was very responsive with any question that I have and tried to check up on us during our stay to make sure everything is ok."
6544715,39970877,2015-07-27,36624405,Kyle,"I had a wonderful time at Emin's house. The space was great for our big group and the area I was initially worried about but everything is under construction around you so the only thing we saw was workers. I will say one downfall was I was told there was parking on the street, I wasn't told until we arrived that the street they were talking about was a block in either direction, I managed to get a parking ticket the last night but as far as the house, it was great and so was Emin, would definitely stay there again. Next time I would just make sure everyone could fit in one vehicle."
6544715,40865439,2015-08-02,34749037,Ellie,"Very large house that is great for a lot of guests. Great outdoor patio space, although the neighbors were very sensitive to noise so something to keep in mind if you like to spend time outside at night. Within walking distance of the beach."

But we spent excellent week in this easily accessible house in subway and bus! We appreciated the simplicity and the flexibility  to take and return
6544715,46471790,2015-09-11,34447113,Dechay,"Our team of 5 women stayed here for a conference and enjoyed the space very much.  It is in a great location and felt very safe. We each had our own bedroom and enjoyed the rooftop patio to relax at night. Also, Emin made it very easy to access the space with our unreliable travel schedules and was very accommodating when we needed a left item shipped to us after our stay."
6544715,51610504,2015-10-22,40138033,Paul,Greet on arrival. Listing was spot on and met our needs. Neighborhood was nice and accessible to greater Boston.

6544715,68688206,2016-04-06,25122410,Len,"We had a great experience at Emin's house. Our 5-person company came to Boston for a retreat, and this place had everything we needed and more."
Each of the bedrooms were comfortable and large,and the kitchen -- which we used to make breakfast in the mornings -- was beautiful. The location is great in a quiet part of Boston,but with easy access to great food and nightlife.,,,
"The upstairs \"\"bedroom\"\" also worked great as a working room for our whole team.",,,,,
"Would (and will!) definitely stay here again.\"",,,,,
6544715,90775883,2016-08-02,60781338,Denes,I spent 4 nights in Boston with my family at Emin's place. Everything was handled professionally and it was very easy to get in touch with him before our arrival. The place itself was clean and organized and made our stay in Boston even more memorable. I would recommend anyone staying at this place. We hope to be able to visit again in the near future.
10807,21271656,2014-10-13,22372886,Noemie,Chambre double correcte avec salle de bain (pas de cuisine). Prix raisonnable avec parking pour un ville assez cher ! Je conseille pour des courts séjours. Merci

I feel like that word is lost in today's society so it was so refreshing to be greeted and treated with amazing hospitality from FJ. She was easily accessible, she greeted my friend and I with fruit and treats, the place was clean and full of beautiful sunlight, and she was just overall an amazing host! The neighborhood is beautiful and feels like home! Transportation is easily accessible and the people there are very warm and inviting people. This has got to be my friend and I best Airbnb experience to date. Thank you FJ for everything :)"
8614167,70733686,2016-04-20,58744592,Breanne,"Great experience renting from Carly! The place was clean, in a great neighborhood/location and very convenient. Carly was very hospitable and called the day before to confirm arrangements and see if I had any questions. Would recommend to anyone. Thanks for a great experience!"

The space is super cozy,clean and bright,and the beds were very comfortable! Already missing waking up to the nice breeze and the birds chirping.,,,
Can't say enough about how great the location is! Beacon Hill is beautiful and safe,and you are walking distance to amazing restaurants (FIGS),bars,grocery stores and wine shops. Boston Common is a few minutes away which was great for lounging in the parks over the weekend.,,
"I would definitely stay at Carly's place again if I find myself back in Boston. So much more to explore! Thanks for everything. : )\"",,,,,
8614167,77048512,2016-05-30,21373800,James,Carly made us feel very welcome - the flat was terrific and in a great area with lots of restaurants and cafes nearby. Would definitely recommend!
8614167,78065682,2016-06-05,40991956,Aaron,"Wonderful location--seriously, really top notch area in Beacon Hill. The interior space was nice and clean, with everything as we'd have expected. Carly met us to exchange keys and was very helpful."
The place is listed as a 2BR,which is not quite accurate. It's more of a studio with a loft and a partially-separated bedroom. There's no floor-to-ceiling walls or doors separating the rooms and the bathroom is accesses through the main bedroom area. That said,"the layout was a nice use of space and worked well with the high ceilings. We enjoyed the space and location very much. \"",,,
8614167,80114079,2016-06-16,12725887,Rhonda,"Our stay in Beacon Hill was simply great. As we were visiting friends, and sites, from Cambridge to South Boston, the location can not be beat; plus walking around Beacon Hill puts a wee bit of Boston history at your doorstep - not to mention the cafes on Charles Street (Tatte is definitely recommended for breakfast). The flat was as advertised and photo(ed). One caveat would be that access to the second bed in the loft could be delicate for older folks. Everything else was great - good recommendations for nearby restaurants."

12383703,97290473,2016-08-26,42742556,Franco,La posizione e' perfetta essendo a pochi metri a piedi dal Boston Common. La presenza di un garage prenotabile e' essenziale per chi deve usare l'auto.
Il quartiere e' ok nel senso che essendo in centro,chiunque può facilmente muoversi. La zona e' di fatto dentro Chinatown quindi molti negozi hanno una offerta prettamente cinese.,,,,
L'appartamento e' sufficiente per 4 persone ed e' tranquillo. Ben dotato come elettrodomestici,"ma scarso per accessori da cucina. La pulizia lascia a desiderare.\"",,,,

The apartment is exactly as shown in the photos,and is very light and open.  It is a studio,of course,so it may feel cramped at times with 2 people,but for me it was plenty of space.  The bed was very comfortable,the desk was great to use for work
The building is great and quiet,and is really incredibly located.  You are so close to so many great neighborhoods!  I had a spectacular time here,"and I thank Jad a lot for making my stay so great.  Hope to come back soon!\"",,,

If you have heavy luggage, please be aware that there is no elevator. This wasn't a problem for me however, and I enjoyed my stay."
9765,1733580,2012-07-17,2640345,Tino Nicolas,PROS:
Location was great and the apt looked exactly how it was pictured. The bed was comfortable,we had two sets of clean sheets and several towels. Soap and shampoo were also provided.,,,,
CONS:,,,,,
Air conditioner was not controlled from our room (8),but from room number 7. Therefore we had NO control at all about the temperature of our location and during the whole time we were freezing. We called Seamless transitions several times and the most they could do was offering to call to room number 7 or some extra blankets. Neither of those resolved our problem.,,,,
Overall:,,,,,
Great experience and would book it again,no doubt!,,,,
It would have been a 5/5 should the A/C had been controlled from our room.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
9765,1878631,2012-08-03,1710888,Kate,We stayed in unit 8.  Exactly as pictured.  Clean and efficient.  Four story walk up so be prepared for that.  Our place was at the base of the stairs up to the fantastic roof top deck.  Easy walk to the T (Prudential or Back Bay).  10 min to restaurant row.
"\"",,,,,
9765,4506191,2013-05-09,5718485,M.,"The neighborhood is great - really close to shopping, Hynes, and Backbay. The room itself was very clean and well-kept and looked exactly like the pictures. It was quiet and overall the stay was very pleasant."
My only complaint was that the promised free wifi did not work. The signal would appear for a minute or so and then disappear. I tried on multiple devices (Mac and PC) and never had any luck. I emailed Kitty at Seamless Transition and never heard back from her during my stay (or since).,,,,,
All in all - this was my first AirBnB experience and it overall was a very good one. However,"if you are planning on getting any work done and need a wifi signal do not count on there being one. You'll  have to head to the nearest Starbucks. I was also a bit disappointed that I never heard back from them. \"",,,,
9765,8916816,2013-11-25,2205790,Edward,"Great place, very amenable, very convenient location for where I needed to be. The fire is a nice touch in the cold weather, heats up the place very quickly!"

I needed a place to stay at the last minute when all of Boston was booked and Kitty was awesome and worked to help find me a place.  In fact,"of the 7 inquiries I made on AirBnB Kitty was by far the fastest to get back to me and made it possible for me to make the trip to Boston.\"",,,,

- Shower (oh the knitted mass of hair in the drain..),,,,,
- Get online (one insecure,wonky network for 2 units),,,,
- Put clothes away (no dressers),,,,,
- read in bed (no bedside tables or lamps),,,,,

"Very affordable price.\"",,,,,
115936,2657138,2012-10-19,3703203,PeachFace,"Jeremy was very quick to respond with any questions or concerns we had. The house was in a really great location, with restaurants and shops and liquor stores, within walking distances. The house was old and neat with newer appliances and furniture. Only concerns we had where- there are ALOT of stairs outside and inside of the house, wasn't a problem for me but my mother in law had a little trouble getting around. The beds have awesome bedding but the beds suck! Not only were the mattresses uncomfortable but they had some unexplainable brown stains we noticed after stripping our beds. The bathroom was nice but the bathtub was something else! It was a small old cast iron tub with hardly any hot water,and super slippery. All in all the house was cool and kinda creepy. I would go back if this concerns were fixed and rental cost went down a bit more."
115936,6806053,2013-08-26,6186961,Susan,I have traveled all over the world over 20 years and have never stayed anywhere where I felt compelled to write a complaint letter.
We paid well over advertised rate for a 3-night stay,$2,300 + security deposit (rate advertised $585/$435 respectively). That was significantly more than either individual unit would cost for the 3 day stay. We asked for the whole house and received an acceptance. When we got to the facility,we found our rental was only for the upstairs,a 4-bedroom,1-bath fire trap.It had no usable safe exit from the bedrooms
"The unit needs TLC. I suspect a letter to the Jamaica Plain City Council and fire department might help or get it condemned.\"",,,,,

The apartment is very spacious with 4 large bedrooms and 5 beds.  Plenty of room for a larger group.  The apartment is a nice mix of old and new.  The WiFi worked great.  The apartment has plenty of sunlight,cable TV,and a warm atmosphere.  One thing - there are quite a lot of steps.  We had no problems with them,but keep that in mind if you have small children.,,
We found Jamaica Plain to be a fantastic eclectic neighbourhood.  We were fortunate enough to dine at 10 Tables right across the road and had a great meal.  Easy access to central Boston.  The train is maybe a 10 minute walk and there are bus stops everywhere.,,,,,
Great communication from Jeremy leading up to our stay.  He was flexible with our check in time.  We didn't need anything during our stay,"but I felt that if we did he would be there for us. We would stay here again if and when we return to Boston.  Thanks Jeremy.\"",,,,

6038520,39745371,2015-07-26,10458438,Scott,Patrick was very accommodating and easy to communicate with. The unit is perfect for a couple and worked well for our 18-mo old daughter. The neighborhood is really nice. You can pretty much walk anywhere in Boston from the rental. We didn't rent a car during our visit and got along just fine. There are great places to eat and drink very nearby. Patrick's recommendations were good too. We would definitely stay at Patrick's place again.

6038520,50304498,2015-10-11,18404080,Whitney,We absolutely loved Meghan and Patrick's apartment! It was just as beautiful as the pictures and even more spacious.

He was an excellent host - very responsive and accommodating. Highly recommend this place!
6038520,56040931,2015-12-08,45402201,Matthew,"Patrick and Meghan's apartment was nothing short of a home away from home.  Extremely clean and tidy, fantastic and safe location in the south end, quiet building, and even came with a thorough list of suggestions on places to eat, shop, etc in Boston.  Apartment was close to many restaurants and convenient stores.  Bed was comfortable, shower was hot.  They were very efficient in communicating with me leading up to the booking date.   Absolutely loved my time at this apartment, would not change a thing about my stay there."
6038520,66039317,2016-03-19,55319693,Matty,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

6038520,73413357,2016-05-08,67200832,Sara,"Very glad we chose to stay at Patrick and Meghan's place! It is very clean, comfortable and in a great location. The list of local restaurants and attractions was a great addition and everything was easily accessible by walking or nearby transit. Our hosts were very responsive and friendly. We would definition stay here again!"
6038520,74446778,2016-05-15,41971121,Samantha,This apartment was a great place to stay with a perfect location. The hosts were very nice and flexible with check-in time and check-out time. I would definitely stay here again if I were to go back to Boston. Only about 15 mins away in a car or 20 mins away from everything using public transit.
6038520,77189988,2016-05-30,833154,Karyn,"Great time staying in Patrick's place! Easy to find, great neighborhood (love the South End!), clean & spacious apartment. Patrick was so great to deal with ahead of time and always responded quickly. I'd definitely recommend his place to anyone visiting Boston!"

6038520,83970599,2016-07-05,76043681,Brian,Lovely apartment in a great location in Boston. Patrick was very helpful in providing a list of restaurant and nightlife recommendations. Would definitely choose to stay here again next time in the area.
6038520,86717483,2016-07-17,568806,Amy,Great apartment for the full-on Boston experience. So perfectly located! We walked everywhere and never had an issue (thanks (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) nav). Clean and just like the pictures. Patrick was a responsive host who made the experience an easy one. Thanks!
6038520,90210088,2016-07-31,5574350,Ed,"This place was amazing! But not just amazing, it was clean, exactly as it was described, beautifully located, and great hosts that communicated quickly and without hesitation."
6038520,94178226,2016-08-15,34757142,Nick,"Patrick's place is awesome. Check-in/check-out was a breeze, and the apartment is in a great location in the South End. We're from San Francisco and Patrick's place really reminded us of home -- high ceilings, unique layout, etc.  We'd definitely try to stay here again if we make it back to Boston."
6038520,97760866,2016-08-28,37570179,Cheryle,Stay went very well. Location was excellent. Comfortable place. Hosts were very accommodating.
568234,1714609,2012-07-15,2856953,Doris,"Ich bin Doris aus Deutschland und habe mich im Juli 2012 einige Tage in Margarets Haus aufgehalten. Ich habe Margaret als einen überaus freundlichen, großzügigen und hilfsbereiten Menschen erlebt. Zimmer und Bad waren gemütlich und sauber. Ich habe mich wirklich wohlgefühlt."
Hundeliebhaber wird es freuen,dass es im Haus zwei große,liebe Hunde gibt. Wenn ich das nächste Mal in Boston bin,komme ich gerne wieder!,,
Herzliche Grüße,Doris,,,,
I am Doris from Germany and I spent a few day in Margarets Haus in July,2012. I perceived her a friendly,generous and helpful person.,,,
My Room and my Bath were cosy und tidy. I felt at home indeed.,,,,,
Dog fancier will be pleased to learn that Margaret keeps two big but friendly dogs in her house.,,,,,
At my next stay in Boston,I will certainly go there again.,,,,
Warmest regards,"Doris\"",,,,
568234,2268119,2012-09-11,1704510,Kathleen,"Margaret is a very gracious host and even gave me a lift to the train at the end of my stay.  The room is pleasant and having a private bath was very nice, as was sitting outside on the deck in the morning with a cup of coffee.  This is a good choice for people who want to be in a residential neighborhood, especially if they have a car and want to have the option to either use public transportation or drive."
568234,2422017,2012-09-26,3162263,Hermann,We liked the stay in Boston at Margaret very much. Margaret is sociable and straightforward and a great hostess. She took us directly after arriving to a trendy bar. Her house is decorated very charming. We could use a very neat bedroom and bathroom on our own floor. The neighbourhood is peaceful and idyllic and Jamica Plaine is within walkjing distance. Very attentvly Margaret compiled an info sheet for us how to use bus and train.
568234,2446465,2012-09-29,827050,Mary,"Our Boston getaway was lots of fun. The room and bathroom were private and Margaret was generous is the use of her kitchen and living space. When we came home the lights were on, nice music playing, and her sweet dogs greeted us. Our host had pointed out that the dogs were friendly. Margaret had written notes about local restaurants and info on how to negotiate the transportation in the city. A very pleasant stay."
"\"",,,,,
568234,2573013,2012-10-10,3512095,Andrea,"We had a very nice stay in Boston with Margaret and her two dogs.  The room and bathroom were well appointed, private, and on their own floor of her home.  Margaret was very generous and provided us with a reference sheet describing restaurants and sights in the vicinity of her home and around Boston as well as how to get around using public transportation.  The neighborhood where Margaret lives is very quiet and peaceful and made for a nice respite after a full day of exploring the city."
568234,2762201,2012-10-30,3727215,John,We stayed with Margaret for 4 nights at the end of October 2012.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Margaret was an excellent host and provided a list of recommendations of where to visit and local restaurants and cafe's.
The accommodation was great we had our own private bedroom and bathroom and also able to make drinks etc in her kitchen.  We came and went as we pleased.,,,,,
We visited the Arnold Arboretum which was only a five minute walk from Lee Street and the trees were fantastic at this time of year.  We also visited the Samuel Adams Brewery which is about a 15 minute walk for a free tour and tasting and if you like beer it is well worth the walk.,,,,,
Margaret was a very welcoming and kind host to us and we can recommend this as a place to stay without reservation.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
568234,2872009,2012-11-12,3653219,Gabe & Tia,I can't recommend staying with Margaret enough!!!
Margaret is awesome!   We came to Boston to celebrate my partners 30th birthday.  Margaret made our trip super special!,,,,,
I emailed her the night BEFORE we were to stay at her place (another reservation fell through).  She emailed me back almost immediately to let me know that she would have our room ready.  When I told her it was our first trip to Boston,she stayed in touch until we got to the metro stop near her home. When it started to snow,I got a message from Margaret to call her when I got to the stop and she'd come pick us up.  I did not expect this and was soooo grateful for it!  Margarets home is lovely,but she along with her wonderful dogs made it feel homely! Our room was nice,private and very cozy.  The bathroom was clean and very bright.  Margaret gave us lots of suggestions on things to do and places to eat.  She was very helpful.  She recommended this nice restaurant,Oleana.  When she learned that it was sort of far out
Her home is close (5 min walk) to the metro and we were able to get everywhere VERY easily.,,,,,
In the mornings,we chatted about social justice,life in the southern united states,her rebellious and socially conscious grandma,the history of Boston,the recent election and tea leaves.  We will always remember these wonderful conversations

568234,2963976,2012-11-26,3493528,Gail,"We spent Thanksgiving in Margaret's wonderful home last week and it was terrific!  The house was exactly what it promised to be - A true urban oasis, with off-street parking for two cars, a private back yard and deck, very comfortable beds and an amazing master suite on the third floor. The open kitchen, dining room, sitting room set-up was great for socializing while making our Thanksgiving feast.  We took a great walk to nearby Arnold Arboretum Thanksgiving day, and visited museums and other city sights the following two days - always looking forward to returning to the house to relax in the evenings. Jamaica Plain is fun to explore and so close to downtown - It was easy to get around by car or by the nearby T station. We highly recommend!"
568234,3015315,2012-12-03,3038115,Doug + Jessica,"\"Margaret was a gracious host. She had the just the right balance of being helpful and hospitable, while allowing us to be independent. She had a thorough list of suggestions for dining in the area - we are so glad we went to Canto 6 and tried their cheese croissants! We ended up taking back a boxful to Vermont. We were totally charmed by Margaret's dog Lu. Was a sweet pup! We are hoping to return to her \"\"their\"\" place in JP !"
"Doug and Jessica\"",,,,,
568234,3210411,2013-01-01,3906924,Christina,We enjoyed our stay at Margaret's house very much. Jamaica Plain is a fun area. Margaret's house is comfortable- beds were particularly comfortable and the 2 guest bedrooms well appointed. We highly recommend her house.
568234,3299980,2013-01-07,3452454,Jean,"Margaret was very kind, even when we had a mix-up the first night we arrived. The room is very comfortable, bathroom close by. Her dogs are very well behaved and she has off-street parking which in Boston is a big plus!"
568234,3725636,2013-03-08,5157536,Richard,Great option and a very pleasant stay. Margaret is lovely and kind. Recommended.
568234,4086489,2013-04-08,3888378,Bob,"4 of us stayed at Margaret's home this past Friday night. It was a perfect location, and a perfect house, as my son was performing in a show in JP. Margaret is so nice and welcoming. Her home was perect for us. I also loved her dogs Lulu and Moses. I highly recommend this house - walking distance to the main street of JP and we walked around Jamiaca Pond as well from Margaret's home."
568234,4229246,2013-04-20,5419731,Eli,"Margaret was a friendly and gracious host and made me feel welcome. Her house is located in the fantastic Jamaica Plain neighborhood, which has plenty of tasty restaurants and is close to the orange line. I was lucky that I ended up with such a generous host in the wonderful city of Boston."
568234,4255581,2013-04-22,2087731,Lillian,I had a great time staying at Margaret's.  She is a very accommodating host.  Her house is well appointed.  Her dog Lulu is a darling.  I highly recommend staying at Margaret's.  I felt right at home at her house.  I look forward to visiting Margaret again in the future!
568234,4306795,2013-04-26,4008979,John,"Margaret's house is cozy, clean, very comfortable and quiet (I had the best night's sleep here I had in ages), and conveniently located in my new favorite neighborhood in Boston - lots of great restaurants and cafés nearby (she wasn't kidding when she said the croissants at Canto 6 are the best in the world!). And having the splendid Arnold Arboretum a short walk away was a nice bonus. Plus, Margaret herself couldn't be more kind, considerate, and hospitable. She's a wonderful host, and truly what Airbnb is all about. (And her dogs are pretty great too!)"
568234,4580872,2013-05-13,4564645,Kathy,Margaret and her house are a delight.  A charming house in a residential neighborhood that makes you forget you're in a big city.  Margaret is very easy to work with and is generous to her guests.
568234,4703383,2013-05-21,4974222,Ronnie,"We really enjoyed our stay with Margaret and her dogs. The garden is really lovely and the pups are sweet though if you are not a dog person Lulu can be a bit much. The two rooms in the second floor have a bathroom and it was perfect for my husband me and hour 15 month old baby. If you rent the entire house, there is a master bedroom/bath on the third floor but do not hesitate to just rent a room while Margaret is there, unless you don't like dogs as she has two. The baby slept in one room and we slept in the other. Margaret even offered to babysit so we could go out to dinner. We didn't take her on her offer but it was sweet of her to offer. She provides details instructions about the house and the neighborhood that helps you orient yourself. We used her laundry which was really convenient and there are several restaurants near by (within walking distance). JP is a cute neighborhood but it does take a while to get in and out of there with traffic. I wasn't prepared for that. We were there during graduation weekend so traffic was even worse but if you stay in JP with a car, be prepared to be stuck in traffic quite a bit and that is the only downside of the location since you are always heading somewhere else (the city, Cambridge, etc.)."
568234,4763109,2013-05-24,1089634,Stuart,"Everything about this stay was good! Owner, Margaret is a lovely, articulate conversationalist & hostess. My bedroom was clean and  nicely furnished, with excellent mattress and private bathroom. Also, plenty of room to park on Margaret's driveway!"
568234,4877979,2013-05-30,121528,Diana,Margaret was a wonderful host and had lots of great tips for food & activities in the neighborhood.
568234,5108714,2013-06-12,6327676,Mike,"Margaret was a lovely and gracious host. We only had a short time to stay (one night) and were very busy on our trip, but she made us feel very welcome and comfortable. My only regret, to match hers, is that we didn't have more time to sit and chat!"
A word about her home,also - it's a beautiful place,very private and quiet,with plenty of space. Her dogs are sweet and lovable,and never caused a problem. And,it's well-placed in Jamaica Plain - close to the T
All in all,"a highly recommended place to stay! \"",,,,
568234,5139351,2013-06-14,886226,Kibbee,"Phenomenal hostess. Really couldn't have asked for more. Not only was Margaret accommodating, but she was extremely friendly and went above and beyond! From allowing us to help ourselves to leftover wine, to her super cute dog lulu-belle. If you're looking to stay in Boston (not at a hotel) please, no really, look no further."
568234,5419130,2013-06-29,2871282,Malte,"I had a great time staying with Margaret in Jamaica Plain. A great house in a lovely neighbourhood. If you are a runner, there are lots of excellent routes in the vicinity, including Jamaica Pond and the beautiful Arnold Arboretum. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Boston."
568234,5473213,2013-07-01,4151865,Julia,"Our family spent a great weekend at Margaret's beautiful home in Jamaica Plains. Her hospitality was fantastic and our daughter fell in love with her amazing dog, Lulu. We really wish we could have stayed longer!!"
"Thanks for everything and hope to see you again soon!\"",,,,,
568234,5536726,2013-07-04,4786115,Barry,"We really enjoyed the 2 nights we had at Margaret's house in July 2013, and wish we could have stayed longer.  She is a very friendly host, and made us feel most welcome. JP is a good neighbourhood to stay in, close to the city by subway and with plenty of good eating options close by, and Margaret provided plenty of recommendations."
568234,5703169,2013-07-12,5295635,Hayley,"Margaret managed to be available when we needed her, and give us privacy we needed it - a very kind person and generous host. A big plus was that our 3 year old loved LuLu and Moses, the very well behaved and friendly hounds of the home. Jamaica Plain is a lovely suburb to roam around, it satisfied our thrift store and (my) chocolate croissant addictions! Thanks for having us Margaret!"
568234,6642885,2013-08-19,8004147,Aine,"We had an excellent stay here. Margaret was very welcoming, and we felt free and comfortable to come and go as we please, as well as make use of her kitchen, patio, and garden.  The rooms were comfortable, and the bedding and towels were clean and comfortable.  Margaret had lots of information about Boston and the local area to hand. it was a really convenient location.  We will definitely be staying here again when we are next in Boston!"
568234,6969746,2013-09-01,8157121,Dvera,"Margaret is a very generous host with a beautiful house and garden. She helped orient me to the city and provided an extensive list of places to eat and things to do in Jamaica Plain and beyond. The neighborhood is very quiet if you need a day off from exploring, as I did, its a great place to take a nap in the middle of the day."
568234,7351312,2013-09-16,8596589,Orma,"Margaret is a great host; available but not intrusive. Great tips about area and Boston. Charming old world home with all the modern conveniences. Laid back, felt at home, comfortable."
568234,7410645,2013-09-19,6244110,Linda,"Margaret is a very helpful and pleasant host. She willingly shares her knowledge of Boston and the surrounding areas.  She has a friendly energetic dog, so this is ideal for dog lovers. The rooms are on the second floor (up some winding stairs so not great if your mobility is limited). One enters through the back door into the kitchen. Both bedrooms are good sized and share a second floor bathroom.  It is sort of like having a private suite, as Margaret's room is on the third floor.  There are groceries, cages and restaurants within easy walking distance. The walk to the T subway is no more than 10 minutes. Very convenient location. Would not hesitate to stay again if I went back. I'm still thinking about those clams, Margaret!"
568234,7451448,2013-09-20,8906064,John,Margaret was so kind and accommodating for my quick trip. The room was wonderful and the location very convenient.
568234,7627143,2013-09-27,8441560,Tracie,Margaret was helpful and responsive.  She readily accommodated a third co-worker with a second bedroom.  We felt like we had a good amount of privacy on our own floor with bedrooms and bathroom.  Jamaica Plains was a great place to hang out.
568234,7651643,2013-09-28,8690098,Jim,"My wife and I had a delightful time at Margaret's home.   Her home is very comfortable, and Margaret is a delightful host.    We had one of our best night's sleep during our vacation when we stayed at her home - the bed was comfortable and we were able to enjoy the cool evening air by keeping the window open."
568234,7978262,2013-10-11,7309929,Susan,"My husband and I spent four lovely days in Boston in early October. Having Margaret's comfortable home to come back to each evening made our stay so enjoyable. She very kindly picked us up (and all our luggage) from Green Street station on our late arrival from Chicago, drove us to her favourite breakfast cafe one morning and delivered us back to Green Street when we left. She had good information about getting around town and generally consoled us over the government shutdown! The queen size bed was very comfortable, the neighbourhood very quiet (a big positive for us being light sleepers) and her home is an easy walk to the station. We would definitely stay with Margaret again and be happy to recommend her to family and friends."
568234,8668656,2013-11-11,9603791,Rebecca,"We had a wonderful stay in Margaret's home in Jamaica Plain; this was the perfect home base for us during our busy weekend visit. Everything was just as advertised - spacious, comfortable and quiet. We hope to stay at Margaret's again on a future trip to Boston!"
568234,10488350,2014-02-21,2281613,Julia,"Margaret's beautiful, spacious and tastefully decorated historical home was a perfect place to re-charge my batteries. A short walk to JP's tree-filled parks, pond and gardens yet minutes to some of Boston's nicest restaurant and coffee spots, I couldn't have hoped for a nicer, more relaxed end to my three-month trip in Europe and the USA."
Margaret,Lulu and Moses made Lee Street a cosy home away from home for me. We had fun hanging out when I felt like seeing a movie and was introduced to Coolidge Corner and some of the best pizza I've tasted. Kicking back watching Sochi on the cosy living room's big screen on a snowy Boston day was equally enjoyable.,,,,
"I look forward to catching up with Margaret next time I'm in Boston and much appreciated the lift to the station and the many other ways I was made welcome. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Margaret and her lovely home to the Airbnb community.\"",,,,,
568234,11553385,2014-04-07,3517906,Socorro,"Margaret's place was exactly what she described ... and more. Her home is lovely, comfortable, and she made sure we were set up for success for a great long-weekend in Boston. We stayed for three nights and in that time she made sure we had maps, lists of places to see, advice for taking public transport, and a great cup of coffee to get us started in the morning. She even went out of her way to drive us places when she was heading out anyway, which was totally above and beyond what was expected. She had two dogs with her (Lou and Moses) and they were calm and not obtrusive at all. I totally 100% recommend it as a place to stay. The location was fantastic to boot. Jamaica Plain is a happening place."
568234,11686579,2014-04-12,3738421,Karen,"My visit to Boston was made 100% special by staying in Margaret's stylish but homely, classic East Coast residence. Myself and a friend both occupied separate rooms , which were very spacious and spotlessly clean. My bed was so comfortable, I just wish it was mine! We had sole use of the bathroom which was just across the landing. The shower was great with ample hot water and again, spotlessly clean, Margaret  even supplied huge fluffy towels. With it's wooden floors , rustic furniture and interesting artwork , this is a fantastic place to stay."
The bus and 'T' are very close by,making it easy to get to and from the museums and sights that Boston has to offer. We felt the neighbourhood to be very quiet and safe,even when returning  late at night.,,,
We used the local cafe for breakfast several times as it was really good,although Margaret also gave us tea,coffee,yoghurt [and wine!] Nothing was too much trouble,she even took us to station on our last day.,
I must mention Lulu the cheeky but delightful dog in residence,she was always ready with an enthusiastic welcome!  I would highly recommend staying with Margaret,"she is a great host. \"",,,
568234,11777886,2014-04-14,590802,Jim,"\"Margaret is a treasure!.  Her home is comfortable, exceptionally clean and a perfect location for visiting Boston.  The \"\"T\"\" is a short walk away and we were in downtown Boston fast - no worries finding a place to park the car.   Also"
We loved staying with her and her friendly,"easy going dog Lulu.\"",,,,
568234,12276056,2014-04-28,11948028,Darleen & Patrick,Highly recommend!!!
We had brief but lovely moments each morning with Margaret as we started our day in Jamaica Plain where we were visiting family. Her home is a delight; much character,clean,spacious and peaceful. Private parking was a major benefit to us as we returned late each evening and didn't have to search for a place on the street!  Margaret was gracious and generous with local recommendations for dining and for outdoor places to hike with the new Siberian Husky in our family.,,,
High praise for a perfect place where we could get a good night's rest after long and wonderfully full days during our stay!,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
568234,12700105,2014-05-08,8529000,Mia,"Just to add one more glowing review to the long list Margaret already has here!  We stayed at her home earlier this summer, but we still speak fondly of it.  It's a beautiful home and a fantastic location (we've lived in JP for 4 years, so we can attest to that fact).  We did not get a chance to personally meet Margaret as she was away, but it was no problem to stay in touch.  We would definitely recommend her home to any visiting friends and family!"
568234,13800000,2014-06-04,15758544,Cathy,"We were very pleased. The location is great, on a quiet block just a five-minute walk from the T. Jamaica Plain is an interesting neighborhood with some beautiful old houses. The bedroom was clean and comfortable, the wifi worked well, and Margaret was very accommodating. We would certainly stay there again."
568234,14138952,2014-06-12,16476532,Ellie,"We had a wonderful time staying at Margaret's home--it truly is a garden oasis with a beautiful and relaxing yard/patio. Her home is conveniently located in JP and includes driveway parking (a major plus for us). The bed is incredibly comfortable. Margaret is a gracious host and we especially enjoyed our canine hosts, Lulu & Moses. We would love to stay at Margaret's oasis the next time we are in Boston."
568234,14589959,2014-06-22,13370242,Abraham,Margaret was a great hostess for my short one-night stay.
The beds were extremely comfortable and nice thick comforters are available if the night gets chilly.,,,,,
A wonderful space,I wish I could have stayed longer to enjoy it longer.,,,,
"Definitely would recommend and stay again.\"",,,,,
568234,14823557,2014-06-27,15539971,Katherine,"My stay with Margaret was great.  She is friendly and welcoming; her house quiet, pretty and comfortable; her garden, yard and dogs an extra bonus; and the neighborhood both nice and quite convenient.  What's not to like!?"
568234,16049547,2014-07-20,18279031,Ruth,The listing described the room very well and met my expectations. The room and bathroom were clean and since the room was in the back it provided me with (URL HIDDEN) was a very short trip  and I didn't even to get to meet Margaret but she provided me with all the essentials. She even left me a note with instructions and we kept in contact via email. I am thankful it was a good experience.
568234,16285028,2014-07-24,18644221,Helge,"We stayed at Margaret's place for two nights. It was great. We had a beautiful room, our bathroom, in the evening we sat in the living-room watching tv and planning ahead our trip and in the morning had breakfast on the veranda. We loved the dogs Lulu and Moses. The neighborhood is just awesome - quiet, but with restaurants, shops and pubs nearby and very close to inner Boston (about 10 minutes by subway plus about 5-10 minutes walk). Margaret had tons of ideas what to do in and around Boston and beyond."
568234,16362334,2014-07-26,17549865,Jonathan,My experience with Margaret was nothing short of fantastic. She was very accommodating and polite. Our flight had been delayed and we got to the house later than expected but it wasn't a problem because we were able to get hold of Margaret straight away.
The house was very clean and our rooms were incredibly laid out. She even made us breakfast in the morning and we had a lovely chat about life in Boston. Not only that but she even drove us to the station the when it was time to leave.,,,,,
"I would definitely stay with Margaret again if I am next in Boston. It's my first experience with Airbnb and I've got to say that my stay surpassed all expectations. It was absolutely fantastic\"",,,,,
568234,16439118,2014-07-27,18547778,David,This was everything that was expected and precisely how it had been described.
568234,16526615,2014-07-28,18605609,Annie,"Though I didn't get the chance to meet Margaret during my stay, due to her being out of town for the weekend, I couldn't have asked for a better experience! Everything was exactly as it says and Margaret was very kind and willing to answer any questions I had. The house was very close to the orange T line which made it very easy to get around. Margaret also left me with instructions on how to get there and some information on the surrounding area. Would definitely recommend the stay here and will probably book again in the future!!"
568234,17352070,2014-08-11,11803245,Ellen,"We stayed at Margaret's house for 5 nights while visiting our daughter and grand baby in JP.  It worked very well for us and was just as she described it.  From the moment we arrived we felt totally welcomed by Margaret.  Although we didn't have the opportunity to visit with Margaret that much because we spent most of our time with our daughter, we did enjoy our conversations with her and found her to be very gracious and interesting.  We found the bed to be comfortable, our accommodations on the 2nd floor private and roomy, and the kitchen and deck overlooking the garden lovely for breakfast.  Also, the on-site parking was very convenient.  We look forward to staying there again on a future visit if the need arises."
568234,17625706,2014-08-15,1202130,Sue  & Tim,"We had a wonderful stay in Margaret's beautiful home in Jamaica Plains. We had comfortable beds in 2 large bedrooms, our own bathroom and the freedom of the kitchen and side verandah to enjoy snacks and tea. Unfortunately  we were only able to meet Margaret and her delightful well trained dog on the last evening and she was so kind and great to chat with."
"It was an easy 10 min stroll to the very frequent \"\"T\"\" to the city",an easy 2 min stroll to the bus (great for the art gallery/museum,Copley Square and Back Bay) beside a super co-op grocery shop. We loved the food at Veve's and the sushi and tempura at JP Seafoods.(5 min. walk) Walking to the Pond and the Arboretum was very easy and well worth it. So a lovely location in a quiet,green area,full of charming houses.,
"Thank you Margaret for your hospitality.\"",,,,,
568234,17770426,2014-08-17,11920771,Matt,Margaret went the extra mile by picking us up at the T stop - a great welcome. We felt at home in her house - spacious and warm.  Fantastic location.

568234,18459567,2014-08-26,12498362,Charlotte,"Margaret was a very very welcoming and friendly host. We immediately felt comfortable in her house . As the weather was nice, we could sit outside on the terrace and enjoy her beautiful garden. We would have loved to stay longer! It is a calm, relaxing place, but still close enough to downtown. For us: perfect stay!"

568234,18496759,2014-08-27,7429079,Ruth,Wonderful host Margaret made us feel really welcome and it was great to spend time in Jamaica Plains.   It really is a relaxing break away from the speed of Downtown Boston.
The room is a great size and Margaret had supplied us with towels and a sheet of local information about how to travel around in Boston and recommendations with local places to eat: both of which were perfect.   The private bathroom was a great help too.  It was also great to spend time talking to Margaret in the evening.,,,,,
"You won't regret staying with her! \"",,,,,

Would love to stay here again and highly recommend."
568234,18612300,2014-08-28,9104744,Georgieanna,"Margaret greeted us with Lulu her darling canine friend.  She escorted  us up to our lovely room and provided a super list of area amenities and was very helpful with restaurant suggestions.  The house is a treasure. Decorated with really funky art pieces and primitive furniture. Nice climate controlled bedroom. Great Cotton sheets, were much appreciated."

I loved all the eclectic restaurants in a diverse community.  The space was clean and comfortable.  Margaret made great,strong coffee for us and recommended a great breakfast place in the area.  (She did offer us yogurt or cereal,but we opted for a full breakfast).,,,
Parking was a plus too especially in Boston!  We had a concert at the Wang Theatre,"so it was only a 15-20 min. ride and it was a relief not to make the late night trek back to RI. \"",,,,

The house was in great shape with plenty of room with facilities that made our stay enjoyable.  We used the kitchen and stored our bikes in the garage.  The location was wonderful near a lot of shops and restaurants on Center St. and a short walk to the T.  It was a perfect location for visiting family in the area.  We loved our stay and would definitely stay at Margaret's again.
568234,20345363,2014-09-28,15156064,Ann,"This was our first airbnb experience and it went very well. The host was charming and helpful, the room was comfortable and very clean, spotless in fact. Even her dogs were fun. We wish we'd had more time to visit with the host (and her dogs). It's very close to South St., with lots of shops, pubs, and restaurants. The streets feel very safe to walk late at night, which we did several times. A+."
568234,20482039,2014-09-29,6862410,Deb,This was a great spot with off street parking-- which was nice since we got in late at night. The room was nice as was the bathroom. We didn't spend much time at the house but Margaret made us a cup of coffee and we hung out on the porch. It was a great spot and really relaxing. The garden and yard were wonderful!! Margaret was a great host with excellent suggestions of things to do locally as well as great suggestions for our trip to Provincetown!! Highly recommend ;)
568234,20530765,2014-09-30,2646509,Cameron,"Margaret is awesome!  She is relaxed, warm, and accommodating.  We felt at home in her place immediately.  It was a quick trip for us (one night in Boston to see a show), but a perfect spot to explore the city from and rest up before returning home. Wish we could have stayed longer.

We were happy to be able to watch Netflix,use the kitchen,and have great wifi connectivity. She even had a power strip in the nightstand so we could plug in the 2 computers,2 iPhones and iPad.,,
Also Lulu was very sweet and well behaved. We felt like we were a part of the family and at the same time had our own private space - the second floor.,,,,,

568234,22552067,2014-11-09,22802536,Natasha,Margaret nos hizo sentir como en casa.  Llegamos del aeropuerto un poco mas tarde y nos estaba esperando.  Nos dio una lista de lugares que visitar y las reglas de la casa. Su perro LULU es muy amigabley conocimos a Moses la ultima noche.
Las habitaciones estuvieron muy bien,igual a las fotos.  El metro esta a 5 minutos y en 15 minutos estas en el centro. Alquilamos un carro desde el aeropuerto,y lo devolvimos al dia siguiente porque no nos hacia falta.  Se los recomiendo.,,,

I took time to wander through the neighborhood which is indeed very cool and worth a visit. I wouldn't hesitate to book the room again or recommend it to a friend."

Lulu has a truly unique canine personality, always ready to play, while Moses was just happy for some quiet petting."

Elle nous a accueillies de manière charmante et nous a fourni beaucoup d'informations sur Boston et les environs de Jamaica Plain, où il y a quelques bons cafés et restos. Le T station (métro) est à distance de marche de chez elle et c'est pratique. Nous avons pu utiliser la cuisine, nous disposions d'un stationnement et nous avions deux très belles chambres climatisées ainsi qu'une salle de bain à notre disposition. Je recommande vivement cet hébergement. Seul bémol, Jamaica Plain n'est pas au centre-ville et il peut s'avérer difficile de s'orienter pour se rendre chez Margaret la première fois."

Margaret's house is located in Jamaica Plain, a nice area with beautiful nineteenth century houses and tree lined streets. The room was big and bed comfy, as was the private bathroom, right next to the bedroom. The neighborhood itself is worth exploring, with lots of green/parks,  and multiple options for restaurants and bars. Access to other parts of Boston is easy with the Orange line a few blocks away and multiple Hubway bike stations in the area (which was our preferred way of transportation)."

She dropped me at my destination once and would have done so more often if I had accepted her generous offers.  She provided a printed sheet that served as a guide to the house and the neighborhood. Margaret is very personable, open to a bit of chatting, but gave us our privacy.  Besides, someone who plays the viola and sings can't possibly be that bad :-) !"

Margrete is a lovely landlord,she cares her tentant,you can tell that from the detailed prescriptive little note and the package of Boston pamphlet/guidebooks she prepared in the guest room before you arrive.  The bathroom is spotlessly clean.  And it is a lovely neighbourhood Margrete place is in,close to restaurants/Cafe and Metro.,,
Just a pity that it started to rain the day I arrived.  Her 13 year old(wise) dog,Moses,"was indeed such a character.  I could feel that he actually said to me(without a word :) the very next rainy morning \"\" to stay in or go out","that is a question !\"\"  Hahaha !

The house is warm, cosy and tidy.   The room is a great size with a comfortable bed, having our own personal bathroom was splendid. The dogs are great fun, Moses a peaceful old poodle and Lulu a younger cross. There is a really splendid arboretum, the Arnold, close by. If you enjoy nature, then you can lose yourself there for a good few hours. Margaret's place is really close to the orange line T, so easy access to Boston. Bella Luna, a pizzeria at the home of Sam Adams brewery (close to the T stop) was so good we went twice :-) Hmmm pizza. If we ever get back to Boston we'll be stopping here again."

Our only regret is that we didn't have more time to hang out with Margaret!"
568234,68163546,2016-04-02,1478362,Leslie,"Margaret's house was fabulous, and Margaret is an exceptional host. The bedroom and bathroom were extremely clean and comfortable! The location is great: walking distance to the Green Street T, near lots of really good restaurants and shops, and my son was even able to get the best haircut of his life just a few blocks away! Perhaps best of all was Margaret's friend Wendy, who was always willing to give information and tips, including a fantastic breakfast spot. We couldn't have felt more at home and more pleased with our choice! Thank you, Margaret (and Wendy)--hope to see you again some day soon!"

568234,68828417,2016-04-07,40488912,Michael,"Margaret was brilliant once again. Made my stay very comfortable and enjoyable. Next time, I need to stay longer!"
568234,69512460,2016-04-11,54003669,Mary,"Margaret was very welcoming and helpful providing tips on things to do in the area, good places to eat and directions. Her home was a short walk from the main street through JP which was very fun to explore. Margaret has a lovely and comfortable home."
568234,70990726,2016-04-22,64674208,Nelle,"Margaret was a wonderful host!  The house is really lovely, and the neighborhood is great."
568234,71035749,2016-04-23,63002277,Sherri,"Staying at Margaret's lovely home was an extremely positive experience. She was very accommodating, warm and helpful. The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. Also, I was surprised by the feeling of privacy Margaret has created. My son and I drove to Boston visiting colleges in the city and neighboring towns, so the parking space and location was very convenient. I would definitely book again."
568234,71803786,2016-04-28,3778307,Kaku,"Margaret was kind, flexible and a joy to interact with. She hosted my aunts for 3 days and they had nothing but praise for her and her beautiful home. She generously gave them a ride to our place (thank you!). When I came to pick my aunts up at the end of their stay, Margaret actually dropped her gardening and came by to meet our 3 month old and me. I could not be happier with the whole experience."
568234,72233911,2016-05-01,18563059,John,"Margaret and her friend Wendy were very welcoming. My room was comfortable and quiet. Margaret's house had an ideal location, very close to the concert I attended, to the Harvard Arboretum, and to the running trail around Jamaica Pond. There were a number of nice restaurants to chose from. Sunday morning I had a delicious croissant from 9 Canto before I got on the Orange Line. Wendy's offer of a ride to the station was very kind. All in all an experience much richer than a stay in a local hotel would have been. Thank you Wendy. John"
568234,73545316,2016-05-08,4431019,Emily,Margaret was great! The house was lovely and overall it was a great experience. Thanks!
568234,77034594,2016-05-30,47731586,Marilyn,"This was a beautiful home with a nice garden to enjoy during morning coffee. Hip, fun, neighborhood.  Hostess very accommodating.I will definitely return."

568234,84813114,2016-07-09,13859660,Susan,"Margaret was very accommodating and very helpful.  The house was lovely, as were the rooms.  Extremely clean.  Great to have off street parking which can be quite a challenge in Boston.  Highly recommend!"
568234,85052364,2016-07-10,7822683,Erin,"We had a great stay at Margaret's home. She gave us a warm welcome and lots of great information about the area, while giving us as much privacy as we wanted. The location was perfect- lots of neighborhood charm just a short subway away from downtown. Having free parking at the house was incredibly helpful, too."
568234,88148562,2016-07-23,78951683,Julie,"I really enjoy the days with Margaret and lovely Lulu. Margaret is so nice and the house is pretty nice, clean and quite. I will definitely recommend her airbnb and will come back again for my next trip."
568234,91318017,2016-08-04,19491984,Suzanne,"Staying at Margaret's lovely house was a charming experience. The accommodation was excellent and shared facilities spacious and comfortable, in particular an outside deck area. Thank you for the helpful information and brochures, and personal input, which made it simpler to decide what to do in Boston."
568234,95256916,2016-08-19,6682932,Debbie,Can't say enough good things about our stay. It's an easy walk to the Green Street T to get downtown and an even shorter walk to the restaurants in Jamaica Plain. We were very comfortable in the house. I felt like I was staying with a relative or friend I hadn't seen in a long time. Margaret couldn't have been more accommodating.
10279083,64743102,2016-03-07,3481964,Ben,The place was exactly as it looks in the pictures! The condo was very clean and relaxing. Edward is super friendly and accommodating. I'd definitely stay here again.
10279083,78004936,2016-06-05,29185488,Michael,Accurate description. Lovely property. As described.
10279083,87325938,2016-07-19,10678749,Ryan,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6690605,43800425,2015-08-22,37092377,Susana,"The apartment is in a great neighborhood, near the T, whole foods and the Bunker Hill Monument. The apartment itself was good, the futon easy to use and comfortable, the kit was great though it did not have all the essentials so check before you plan on making a meal. Jen was a great host, very nice and flexible."
6690605,49026886,2015-09-30,26221962,Ruediger,"Very beautiful apartment in top condition in a charming house with all amenities (kitchen, washer and dryer etc.) Great location. Whole Foods is just a few minutes walk away. So is the harbor where you can catch a shuttle to Boston downtown. By bicycle it takes only about 10-15 minutes to MIT, mostly on bike paths. Very responsive and friendly host. I can highly recommend this place and I am glad I had an opportunity to stay there."
6690605,49492251,2015-10-04,43807454,Brian,"This place was exactly as advertised. Clean, quiet and perfect for what we were looking for. Any questions I had were answered almost as quick as I emailed them. I would have my family stay here again when they are visiting."
6690605,51453920,2015-10-20,19254731,Nicole,"Our stay with Jennifer was excellent. Great location. The apartment was as described, very clean and had all the necessities. She provided some recommendations of local places which was also helpful. She was very kind with checking in often throughout our stay. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!"
6690605,68336251,2016-04-04,2477244,Alex,"Great apartment for a family of 3-4. Nice, clean neighborhood with some tasty breakfast/lunch options and several historical sights right outside. Just across the bridge from the center of Boston, easy 15 min walk. Jennifer was very easy to communicate with."
6690605,73017180,2016-05-06,59654256,Kerry,"The apartment is at the ground floor of a larger house and is separated from the main house with a door lockable from within the apartment. It is located just a couple of blocks away from the Bunker Hill monument and is very convenient for working or visiting the naval dock area. There is a large Whole Food store within walking distance: a little pricey, but great for grocery."
Because the apartment is on the ground floor and there is a pavement right outside,you will see people walking right outside if you open the blinds. Not a big problem during the week,but there was a little more foot traffic during the weekend. For a similar reason,I used an eye mask to block out more of the street light at night.,,
Although I did not meet her in person,Jennifer was  super responsive to queries and problems. I was very impressed that she bought new sheets and an iron. As mentioned in another review,it would have been nice if there were more cooking utensils. Having said that,Jennifer brought down a larger pot when requested.,,
Because I am not used to laundry detergent with a strong fragrance,I had to air the sheets out when I first arrived - this may not be a problem for everyone. Lastly,I am not sure if it was the mattress or the base,but there was some unevenness.  Nonetheless,I slept well,"it is perhaps just something to attend to in the future.\""
9685076,72005753,2016-04-30,57654468,Julian,"Hi Marie, I can not complain about anything. A nice place to stay at. I liked that you provided fruits and water for the time. That's a plus! Thank you for everything you did for me."
9685076,77436815,2016-05-31,58030396,Said,"Marie was a Great host, Always checked on how I was doing."
I am in the hospitality industry,so I'm a big critic and very meticulous and Marie gave no excuse to complain from the treats in the kitchen,the bottled water in the refrigerator,"and the clean linen she was very attentive to all my needs outstanding service. Thank you Marie and will be looking to staying with you next time I'm in Boston Five stars\"",,
9685076,97768757,2016-08-28,64403506,Steven,"Exactly the same as the last time; Marie was very kind, polite and friendly. Regardless of whether you are a student or tourist, this is the place to be!"
728238,2771912,2012-10-31,3440096,Anthony,Robin is a very nice and funny girl. It was a great moment to stay with her and her so nice dog Sammy :)
728238,4069873,2013-04-07,2414274,Xóchitl,"Robin's place was very warm and accessible. Brilliant location in JP and was really helpful with recommendations, places to go and overall very friendly."
728238,4190394,2013-04-16,117637,Christian,"Robin was a great host.  Our paths only crossed a few times, but I completely enjoyed our conversations.  Her place is exactly as described and Sammi, her dog, is a sweet and cheerful greeter."
728238,5535910,2013-07-04,4645886,Loes,"good commication, we were last minute but we could still stay here. nice and quiet neighborhood, overall good experience staying here"
728238,6233520,2013-08-04,5521497,Kristina,"We loved our stay there! It was a nice apartment, good location and such a nice and friendly Robin :)"
728238,6448720,2013-08-12,6485243,Ekaterina,very nice location and friendly host. robin replied fast and was very helpful. I enjoyed my stay very much
728238,6887201,2013-08-28,7241123,Lea,"Robin is the best host ever! Her house is really cosy, well situated in a nice area. Robin was so helpful and very lovely. I strongly recommend her"
728238,7079650,2013-09-05,8186683,Donald,"Robin is very helpful, the room very nice and access to downtown Boston is good! V pleasant stay."
728238,7143380,2013-09-08,2171078,Doris,"Clean, comfortable and convenient accommodations! Robin is a friendly and helpful hostess!"
728238,7318556,2013-09-15,8546806,Jetske,"Robin is a great host! Communication was very easy and she is really helpful, funny and friendly. Her dog is also really sweet. The house is easy to reach by public transport, about 30 minutes from downtown Boston but also close to the center of Jamaica Plain and the beautiful Jamaica Pond."
728238,7906711,2013-10-07,998349,Navdeep,"Robin was very kind and responsive via email and text.  We never actually met since my girlfriend and I were out and about most of the time, but her home was very well kept and clean."
728238,8096418,2013-10-15,9060421,Dvora,Convenient location. Easy to get downtown. Friendly.
728238,8837914,2013-11-20,5927625,Jo-Annie,I only spent one night at Robin's place but it was great.
"Her dog is quiet and friendly!\"",,,,,
728238,10869098,2014-03-10,12828547,Emeralde,"Robin was a wonderful host. She was full of recommendations for what to do in the area - contra dancing was a fun option, although her house was also great for just being lazy in pajamas and watching movies. She gave us full access to the kitchen, which was fun because there was a little food co-op right down the block. The neighborhood is quaint, with a large brick library and a mix of local restaurants - we settled on Dominican food, from a selection of Mexican, Ethiopian, and Middle Eastern options, among many others. Even though we only stayed for a short time, Robin's home was perfect for our purposes - comfortable, inviting, and cozy. We would definitely stay there again."
728238,11384997,2014-03-31,13549453,Sairah,"This was my first time using AirBNB and I'm so glad that it was such a positive experience.  Given that this room costs as much as a shared room with 3-5 strangers in a hostel, I appreciated this deal-- and the privacy and safety I felt in her very cozy home.  Robin really made me feel like I was at home in being able to use her kitchen and bathroom. With regards to the bedroom, I felt that my privacy was  respected and never felt compromised. I will also point out that she is hilarious."
Her dog Sammi is an absolute sweetheart. Robin also had a full extension outlet I could use to charge my phone,laptop,and camera battery and the wifi was great.,,,
As I used only public transit in Boston,the room's location was extremely convenient-- the 39 bus is right there and the T is a 10 minute walk away. Great eats line the street for 4 blocks in either direction (but if you ask me,hit up Fiore's which is a 2-minute walk for a great,2 meal sandwich). Robin also offered great information as to what to visit when in Boston and was overall,very friendly. My room,sheets
Getting to the room was a little confusing,but that was less because of Robin or her instructions and more because of the layout of Jamaica Plain itself,which,per most JP residents,"is a little \"\"wonky\"\" (to use a technical term). But it doesn't take very long to get the hang of JP. \"",
728238,11604926,2014-04-08,13616493,Antony,"Booked the place last minute and had a great experience staying with Robin. Room was lovely, bed was comfortable, shower was excellent and the dog is just the cutest little thing! Thanks for a wonderful stay. Would recommend to all. Thanks very much, TONY"
728238,11819900,2014-04-15,2747348,Yannick,Robin was not here during the weekend we came and immediately offers her own rooms and beds. I did not meet her personally but we communicated by mail and their was no problem for check-in and check-out.
728238,12127921,2014-04-23,13399066,Deborah,Disappointed. Not value for money. Sleeping arrangement leaves much to be desired.
728238,13157663,2014-05-20,14319720,Milo,We had a lovely stay at Robin's apartment. Everything was clean and she was a nice and helpful host. It's also conveniently located. I can recommend it to anyone.
728238,13452269,2014-05-27,15345562,Alen,"Private, convenient, and affordable."
Needed a place to stay while apartment hunting in Boston. First time using Airbnb,so I was a little worried about living with a stranger. Robin turned out to be one of the sweetest people I ever met! She and her roommate even gave me housing advice. Robin was out half of the time. Her dog guarded the the bed when she was away.,,,,
The room was as described: a TV room turned into a bedroom,with a hanging sheet dividing the bed from the entrance to another room (rented by a male). Some might find this setup awkward,but never during my stay did I feel a lack of privacy. I was very much left alone. Robin's bedroom is right next door through a set of locked wooden doors. You have access to the large kitchen and bathroom.,,,
The room was a perfect place to stay for 2 nights during my apartment hunting. Her place is less than a 10 minute walk to the Forest Hills Station on the Orange T Line,which allows you to transfer to the Green,Red,and Blue Line. The 39 bus stops right outside her house as well. If you're travelling to Boston and entering at Back Bay Station,you can take the Orange Line straight to Robin's. The area is safe,quiet
I told Robin before I left that I will definitely return! I am a male,25 years old,"from Brooklyn.\"",,,
728238,14067479,2014-06-10,16427960,Steven,"Everything as advertised, no-hassle hostess, fantastic neighborhood, very reasonable price."
728238,14527500,2014-06-21,6096113,Joanna,Robin was a good host.  She was very friendly and responsive to my needs.  Her house was in a nice and convenient location in Boston.
728238,15479829,2014-07-09,3550406,Megan,"The room was comfortable and I think the shower saved my life! It was very last minute and Robin was very accommodating. The neighborhood was quaint and queer; a little far from Boston downtown and Cambridge (I rented a bicycle from Ferris Wheels across the street), however a 10-15 minute walk from the orange line subway which is very efficient. There is a great park/pond very close by and lots of food spots. Overall it was fantastic for a last minute place to stay."
728238,15854593,2014-07-16,76692,Sarah,"Robin is very friendly. The apartment is cute, the location is great. Parking is a bit hard though. I would recommend this place if your going through Boston."
728238,16188954,2014-07-22,6013898,Keven,"Although I didn't meet Robin, I had an overall good stay in  her place. It was comfortable and it had a few restaurants around the neighborhood. To add, Sammi, her dog is so great and seems to just be filled with love. The only thing that i would mention is that her home is like a 10 min walk from the last stop in the orange line so if you want to be close to the center, this may not be the best place."
728238,17022842,2014-08-05,317183,Sarah,I had a good time chatting with Robin!
728238,17303737,2014-08-10,6217433,Katharina,"\"The whole apartment was dirty, the \"\"bed\"\" (although let's be real and call it what it is- an old pullout couch) was so uncomfortable that our whole bodies hurt"
728238,19571148,2014-09-14,20233867,Cesar,"The hostess was correct, predisposed to help, friendly. The location is remarkable, with 39 bus in 5 minutes you reach the T (train) Orange that take you to downtown Boston in 15 minutes. What is unviable is her sofa bed, whi ch it is impossible to sleep. I personally suggested her change that. For the rest thank you very much."
728238,19850103,2014-09-19,21187077,Finbar,"Robin is the real deal. Really enjoyed chatting with her. The space was nice and cozy, and Robin really went above and beyond to make me feel welcome."
728238,20474523,2014-09-29,3142757,Chris,Place was exactly as advertised.  Easy walk to T stop on Orange line and a bus stop is literally across the street.  Just got a new matress for the pullout sofa and it's actually really comfortable.  Robin is super nice and a pleasure to talk to.  I would recommend staying here.
728238,20983789,2014-10-08,10902247,Josh,Great host - very friendly and welcoming! Everything was very clean and the bed was surprisingly comfortable!
728238,21021322,2014-10-09,22123207,Joel,"This is definitely a last minute option with the sofa bed. Good location. We parked our motorbike right in front of the house and we were 10-15 mins ride to downtown. The neighbourhood looked very nice and peaceful as we drove by - nice park by a body of water, runners, strollers....Robin was very warm and casual. Sammy (her dog) is very very very friendly. It is a sofa bed, so expect to sag into the middle. There is a dog, so expect the floor to have hair and dust. The shared doorway leads to this sofa bed and another room. Robin did put up a curtain for some privacy. If you don't mind all these things then it's a good last minute option."
728238,21775034,2014-10-23,1458854,Ann,"Our car broke down in Boston and we needed a last minute place to stay for the night. Robin responded to us quickly and graciously welcomed us to her home even though we arrived after 10 soaking wet. Sensing we had had a difficult day, Robin had even put mints on our pillows! Fresh sheets and towels, a Keurig for morning coffee, a very sweet puppy -- this place was wonderful, and we felt right at home. Though it's true that it isn't fully private, it felt perfectly private to us. Thank you Robin for rescuing us!"
728238,21865256,2014-10-25,22867169,Joshua,"Robin is very friendly and has great recommendations. Didn't see her too much as she was out most of time(Friday night and Saturday). Stayed on sofabed, was pretty comfortable, had good sleep. There is bus 1 min walk away that takes you to T orange line into Boston(3 min bus ride and 20 min T ride into downtown). Jamaica Plain is small but real cool, also 15 min bus ride from fine arts museums. She has a dog but dog is super calm, didn't even hear it bark. Highly recommend staying here. Will look for her again."
728238,22045048,2014-10-28,22667697,Tony,"Robin was a great and easy host. She helped me figure out the best ways to navigate Boston for some tightly scheduled meetings. And, she was flexible with my flight coming in after midnight."
"It's just what I expected at this price point. It's like crashing with a friend on a comfy couch.\"",,,,,
728238,22475196,2014-11-07,23189451,Shani,Robin is so welcoming. I enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend her for anyone coming to the area.
728238,22724000,2014-11-12,7866528,Amanda,"It was very easy going at Robin's place. At first I was surprised that there was another roommate too, but it turned out fine and he is really nice as well. Robin was helpful with tips about where to shop for things and made me feel at home in her kitchen and going in and out. It was quite by 10pm which was important for me and is a place I would go back to on another visit to Boston."
728238,22869646,2014-11-16,3920798,Judith,"Fantastic place! Robin is a lovely host, apartment very clean, and easy to get to via public transit. Recommended!"
728238,25532056,2015-01-18,26109890,Sandra,"Robin accepted my last minute reservation, and was so nice and informative, as this was my first AirBnB experience.  Her home was perfectly located to walk into town, and was easy to find, as I got in around 10pm using Uber.  The bed was very comfortable (Robin put a York peppermint patty on my pillow"
728238,29068675,2015-04-03,4955877,Xi,Great host
728238,29242554,2015-04-05,3288837,Louisa,"Robin is sweet. My boyfriend and I spent a weekend at her house and she made us feel very welcome. The flat is beautifully decorated and very cozy. Robin's dog Sammy is cute and I am sure that even people who usually don't like dogs, will like Sammy. One of the wonderful things about Robin's flat is the location, right in the heart of Jamaica Plain (and easy to reach with bus and metro). We loved the neighborhood. If you are staying with Robin, make sure to visit Monumental Cupcakes and if possible see a show at the Footlight Players Theatre (Robin is involved in some productions as a stage manager). I would recommend Robin's place for short stays. If you want to book her guest room, you should however be aware that it leads to a second bedroom that is occasionally rented out (I am not sure how frequently and I assume that Robin mainly hosts players of the Footlight Company). This means that it might happen that someone walks through your room at night. The bed is protected from view by a curtain - but you might still hear footsteps and voices."
728238,31048741,2015-05-01,20893071,Saritha,"The place is super easy to find and has a lot of cute shops around. Lots of cheap eats. There are two T stations that are very close by. Robin was so sweet, welcoming, and really easy to talk to. Her dog is extremely well behaved. The house is very clean and organized. The room we stayed in was well worth the price. There's even a mini heater provided. I would stay here again."
728238,37068990,2015-07-04,34096549,세연,"quite far from downtown but it was possible. safe,cozy neighborhood!"

728238,37498448,2015-07-07,34495055,Yooran,she is very kind so my feeling was so comfortable during staying here and this place is not near downtown.
728238,38463812,2015-07-15,38026700,Steven,"Robin's place was very nice and comfortable. I found it with ease and it's very close to the T. The sleeping space is very comfortable for 1 or 2 people as it's a wide sleeper sofa. Robin was very kind and comfortable and so was her dog Sammi (a very friendly dog). Robin was easy to get along with. She even leaves a York Peppermint Patty on the pillow (she had no way of knowing that I love those). I would stay here again. Thank you for your hospitality, Robin."
728238,39104582,2015-07-20,37884131,Justin,"Robin was very nice and accommodating and the space was clean and cozy. She made my girlfriend and I feel welcome in her home and that was very much appreciated. Her location is very convenient for getting to local area attractions, including Fenway Park, the Sam Adams Brewery, and Boston Common. The bed was comfortable and we had use of a nice-sized television, though we didn't watch much."
The only negative was the room was without it's own air conditioning,and there was nothing in the room description about this. We just happened to be in Boston during a weekend of 90+ degree high temps,"so the room quite warm during the day and was difficult to cool even with a box fan at night.\"",,,

The place is exactly as described in the listing an did very well for staying just 2 nights. The place is right next to the Harvard arboretum which was amazing! Thanks for everything Robin!"
728238,41249462,2015-08-05,18663598,Marion,Quel séjour formidable !
Robin est une hôte fantastique ! Elle a été extrêmement disponible : Elle nous a fait partager les meilleurs adresses de Jamaica Plain,qui est un quartier super plaisant. Nous avons pu beaucoup échanger avec elle,elle nous a communiqué sa joie de vivre,son rire et son plaisir pour les bonnes choses ! Elle cherche toujours a améliorer le confort de ses hôtes.,,
Les 4 jours sont passés trop vite et nous serions bien restés quelques jours de plus !,,,,,
Sammi,son chien,est adorable et attachant.,,,

728238,41910196,2015-08-09,1892610,Cassie,Robin was very friendly and the space is exactly as listed. Great proximity to the shops and restaurants in Jamaica Plain.
728238,42069883,2015-08-10,17163507,Corrine,"I loved Robin, I want to be her friend! The whole apartment is eclectic and wonderful, and I slept so well in the bed. It really is the perfect last minute stay."
728238,42364107,2015-08-12,4527240,Brenda,"Robin was flexible when I wasn't able to arrive as planned. Access was easy when I did arrive and I had a restful night's sleep on the comfy pull out. She suggested a terrific place for dinner nearby which I enjoyed while catching up on my reading. Her dog, Sammi was lovely and her roommate from Ireland was easygoing and adaptable to the shared space. I would definitely stay there again."
728238,42784477,2015-08-15,18263953,Nicholas,"Our stay with Robin was lovely. The neighborhood was really nice to explore and well connected by bus and metro to the rest of the city. The space was very well kept and as advertised. Also, Sammi is the most charming dog you will ever meet!"
728238,43374382,2015-08-19,35261008,소희,"Robin was the most kind host we've ever met. Her sweet dog Sammi welcomed us. Everything we needed was provided such as shampoo,hair dryer and fast wifi.It was very comfortable. Although we didnt expect that the room was connected to another room, we had no problem having our private space."
728238,44015036,2015-08-23,40345045,Qingyun,A very enjoyable trip. Robin is very humorous person. The room is clean and warm too. Sammy is a good dog. Miss her.
728238,44757865,2015-08-29,14409400,Kristína,Robin is very friendly and lovely. She made me feel like at home. The room is nice and comfortable. The location is great. Short walk (1-2 min.) to the bus stop. Her dog Sammy is amazing!
"Thank you Robin for this week. Hopefully see you again.\"",,,,,
728238,44920216,2015-08-30,37496646,Akemi,My host was very welcoming.  She was there to greet us. We felt very welcomed at her place.   The place is in a convenient location from the college my child is going to attend.  It takes only one bus ride to her place!  It also has a great breakfast eatery that Robin introduced to us.
728238,46435054,2015-09-10,33884268,Reza,Robin is a great host. she is friendly. I appreciate her hospitality. her dog Sam is a nice dog. I am not a dog person but after meeting Sam i think I have become one :)
"Thank you Robin!\"",,,,,
728238,46818357,2015-09-13,4995566,Mara,"This was a great last minute option for us staying in Jamaica Plain. Robin was extremely nice and patient with us when we got in late and woke her up.  The bed was extremely comfortable. The room wasn't too private, but it worked just fine for us and was just as described. Overall we were very pleased we decided to stay here."
728238,47872953,2015-09-21,43602557,Anna,"We absolutely loved the neighbourhood: easy to access the city (bus outside the door, city bikes across the road, metro not far); possible to go for a run around a local pond/park; safe and nice to walk around; easy to park on the street for free. Robin was very easy-going, friendly, fun, and willing to offer any tips on the city & local neighbourhood. The room is semi-private as described, but it was perfect considering we spent our time out in the city site-seeing. I would say this is perfect as a base when you plan to spend most of your time out and about in lovely Boston. Thanks for taking us at the last minute, Robin!"
728238,48346304,2015-09-25,35211738,Richard,"Robin is a dream host.  A perfect blend of thoughtfulness, humor, and kindness.  She treated me like an old friend from the moment I walked in the door.  Her home is indeed cozy and very clean.   I hope to be visiting with Robin again in the very near future!"
728238,48552319,2015-09-27,23978643,Cary,"We spent such a tiny amount of time there, but Robin was sweet and the room was as described and comfy.  Feel better Robin!"
728238,49209568,2015-10-02,7793137,Anastasia,"You should be ready that the room is not completely private, but with such hospitable and friendly host it is not a problem at all. Robin does everything to make guests feel like at home. Location of her house is rather convenient: 10 mins by foot to the subway. Regarding parking: there is free street parking, but you may need some time to find not occupied place."
728238,49558307,2015-10-04,45309020,Tracy,The host Robin was very nice and welcoming. My girlfriend and I did have some trouble sleeping on the double sofa bed as it sags a bit in the middle so we had very little room to move and I'm one of those people who need my space.  Perhaps better suited to one person?  Semi-private describes the room accurately as we never spoke above a whisper as to not disturb the host and other Air B&B guest as the walls connecting the two rooms are very thin and there is a hanging curtain providing some privacy from when the other guest comes in and out of the shared door.  I am a light sleeper so perhaps I should have booked a private room with Queen or King Bed. The shared bathroom outside the room was clean but we did not get a chance to try the bath/shower since we left so early.
728238,50247617,2015-10-10,45852965,Hazel,My host was a perfect hostess.  She was continuous contact with me before my arrival.  I actually arrived late in the night and it was not a problem.  She left my key in the drop box and I was safe and sound in bed as soon as I arrived.
"\"",,,,,
728238,51083024,2015-10-17,46238726,Kate,"Robin was the friendliest host I've ever had. She is warm, and welcoming, and has the most adorable dog in the world, Sammy, who will cuddle with you in bed if you let her. You are able to use the kitchen to make food, and there are comfy, fluffy blankets waiting for you. It's in a safe and cute part of Jamaica Plain, with Centre Street within walking distance to many cafes, restaurants, and most importantly, comic book stores. This is the place to stay."
728238,51178956,2015-10-18,15918835,Cassandre,"Durant notre séjour, nous n'avons pas vu Robin, mais cela n'a pas posé de problèmes car il a répondu à toutes nos questions. L'appartement se situe à 10-15 minutes à pied d'une station de métro, ce qui est agréable. Cependant, il faut préciser que la chambre n'est pas une chambre privée, puisqu'elle permet également d'accéder à une chambre. La chambre est seulement fermé avec des draps, ce qui n'est pas très intime. Le ménage peut laisser également à désirer, c'est dommage !"
728238,53573228,2015-11-09,28859508,Leizl,"Great place to stay. Had no trouble finding the place. Instructions were clear. Her place had just what I needed which was a bathroom and place to sleep.  Bed was not that comfortable, but alls good! I'm not that picky. Robin was kind and I was able to pass out. Also met sammie her dog who's a sweetheart as well. Will recommend! The area around is gorgeous! Such a colorful area :)"
728238,54829392,2015-11-23,49508751,Matt,"BEWARE OF THE DOG!!! If you aren't careful the dog will cuddle with you in bed. But seriously this was as expected, nice, quiet, cozy pullout couch with a sheet hanging in the room to separate you from the other Airbnb guest."
728238,68526480,2016-04-05,47257669,Janis,"Robin is a caring and passionate host who will ask if everything is okay and will provide help if anything is needed. The sofa bed is a bit too soft but Robin can provide some wood to add more support to the bed. Her dog, Sammy, is smart and friendly as well.  If you don't pay attention to her, she won't pay attention to you, so it's still fine for someone who is afraid of dog (like me)."
728238,70269661,2016-04-17,64402687,Monika,"Robin ist sehr nett, gastfreundlich und hilfsbereit. Sie hat auch gute Tips gegeben. Ihr Hündchen, Sammy ist sehr lieb und ruhig. Das Bettsofa ist sehr weich. Ich habe keine Rückenprobleme da gings gut. Das Zimmer ist hübsch. Wenn aber weitere Gäste da sind, wird das Zimmer mit einem Vorhang unterteilt, dass diese zum hinteten Zimmer gelangen. Das sollte einem nicht stören. Mir hat es gut bei Robin gefallen."
728238,70529820,2016-04-18,34873643,Liza,"Robin was an excellent hostess. Not only did she welcome my film crew with open arms, she also fostered a funny environment and worked with our actors. We are all so unbelievably thankful for Robin's generosity and kindness on set and understanding/appreciation for our project. Her house was also beautiful. The vibrant colors of the house reflect Robin's vibrant attitude. And for the price??? We definitely all enjoyed this daytime stay :)"
728238,70764486,2016-04-20,60707253,Karolína,It was very nice place and Robin is very friendly person :) I really liked this accommodation! It is not that far from the subway and there is also bus stop close to the house. It was lovely place. Robin has a nice dog. There is only one thing I was worried (URL HIDDEN) was the window because something was wrong with it and the room was a bit cold as a result but we had enough clothes at night so it was ok :) I do recommend this accommodation to other guys as well :)
728238,70899822,2016-04-21,598150,Tracy,Robin was so nice and hospitable! Her home was very neat and pleasant. She has the best protein bars I've ever tasted! And the heated seat is heaven
728238,72749555,2016-05-04,68832372,Bill & Julie,"Robin is a warm & friendly host. The location is very convenient and the bed sublime, but the #1 treat is the heated toilet seat. Got to get one of those for ourselves. THX Robin - Bill & Julie"
728238,74243782,2016-05-14,69679431,Yuzana,Robin was really nice and accessible. She was very responsive and her dog was extremely cute! All in all I had a great experience staying at Robin's. It was only 10 mins walking distance from the Church Ave stop and was easy to go to other places.
728238,75405191,2016-05-21,48117898,Noriko,The host was nice and also her dog was nice. The place was near the station so it was convenient.

728238,79798345,2016-06-14,50403689,Steve,The host is nice and it's near bus station or subway.  You can also find her lovely dog also.
728238,81260106,2016-06-21,7780693,Susanne,"Jamaica Plain is an amazing place to start visiting Boston. The Bus to down town Boston is directly in front of the house over the street. Moreover, Longwood medical area is directly on the route of this bus. Therefore, this accommodation is perfectly suited for someone, working there, like me."
Robin was very easy going and arranged everything for our one week stay including easy arrival and departure. We could use the very good equipped kitchen for breakfast and dinner,which was really very comfortable.,,,,
"We enjoyed our stay a lot.\"",,,,,
728238,86394474,2016-07-16,76478359,Sarah,"Robin was very welcoming and flexible, and the room was as described. Jamaica Plain is a fun, relaxed neighborhood with quite a few cute shops, parks, and restaurants within walking distance."

Robing was welcoming, flexible and her dog Sammie is super lovely. The other guests are also very nice. The place has everything you need. I had a good stay there thanks for hosting, Robin."

728238,92039874,2016-08-07,17023177,Nicolae,"We had a very pleasant stay at Robin's place. I was there with my girlfriend for 2 nights while apartment hunting. Robin was out of town but left us the key in the mailbox and we had no trouble getting in. The place is very cozy and nice, although if you're looking for a lot of privacy it may not be the best for you. Great for a night rest. Robin's dog, Sammy, is very friendly and adorable. Usually there may be another Airbnb customer in the room next door, but it's not a problem as they can just get in their room easily."
728238,93198469,2016-08-11,38014474,David,Robin is a great host! She is very warm and open person! I would stay there again.
728238,96360136,2016-08-22,17821626,Roanne,"This place was a very good last minute option to stay for us! Robin was a very nice host, who made us feel at home. The neigbourhood was great as well. We could reach the city centre easy by metro, bus, or city bike. You can have a nice walk through the neigbourhood or have a nice breakfast just down the road. We should say the bed was not so comfortable. Also, the room does not have much privacy, since this room had an entrance to a different room (but it is seperated by a curtain!). All in all, we are very happy Robin had a place for us, which was very easy to reach and convenient."
728238,97122038,2016-08-26,251093,Jeff,Robin's place was just what I needed and in a fun location. I would stay there again no problem!

"Thanks Jordan.\"",,,,,
8814215,62152653,2016-02-12,40111721,Jack,Great facility and location. Comfortable to stay at this place with my family. Everything in the apartment is set so well. Yet its customer service (operated by StayAlfred) is not so good; for example: the laundry card was in low balance (due to some mistake) and they promised to re-fill. Yet it didn't do so until calling again two days later. Someone came in and promised to re-fund me the amount I put in. Yet they didn't until I asked again and again... Even after I checked out for over 10 days.
8814215,93719448,2016-08-13,7767025,Laura,"Overall, our stay was very good:  rooms are bright and spacious; lots of closet space;  windows are large and offer wonderful views of the Charles, the Statehouse, the Commons and Beacon Hill;  towels and linens were good quality. Providing basic paper goods was appreciated on arrival.  Location is excellent for walking to sights, other neighborhoods and shopping.  On site gym is good.  The building is a high rise but not too busy and our apartment was quiet."
Some areas for improvement:,,,,,
Plaster hanging down in dining area needs repair,,,,,
Bathroom vanity doors did not close properly,,,,,
Living room carpet was a lint and dust generator and needs to be replaced,,,,,
Dishes and silverware are missing pieces,,,,,
Dining room chairs sagged and should be replaced from Cort rental,,,,,
Since MBR floor buckled,closet doors were difficult to open,,,,
Who ever suggested a high gloss finish on the wood floors??  Net result was visible scratch marks.,,,,,
Nice to offer a $30 loaded card for the basement laundry facility.  Suggest offering a credit with the on site dry cleaner who does laundry,folded,"for $1.50 / lb.  \"",,,

13912472,91247313,2016-08-04,40723717,Luis,"This was my third time staying at one of Mario's properties and just like the other stays, this one was great as well. Mario is always available if you have a question or an issue and is quick to respond. Will definitely be staying at one of his properties again."
13912472,93163256,2016-08-11,50326977,Joe,We really enjoyed our stay here and Mario was very accommodating. We had a couple requests and without even a reminder they were takin care of. The location was great for us also. Very short walks to some of Back Bay restaurants etc. We also walked to Newbury St which is a little further out but an easy city walk. The place is on a nice one way street and we felt very safe at all times. We highly recommend and will stay here again.
13912472,94110896,2016-08-14,69056011,Dylan,Place was perfect and in a great location. Checking in and out was very easy and Mario left fridge stocked with drinks. Overall great experience

The property has three rooms: bathroom with a nice shower,a small bedroom (full-size bed barely fits,but it was fine),and a living room/kitchen. I stayed with my family (wife and two teenagers) and we had enough room,although it's certainly not spacious. The second bed is a full-size Aero bed  that's stored in the closet. There's a pretty big flat-screen TV hanging on the wall with Netflix and HBO access. A small window A/C unit in the bedroom kept the bedroom nice and cool and the rest of the apartment comfortable (and it was pretty hot outside during our stay).,
The neighborhood is very safe and quiet,with several excellent restaurants within a short walk. As far as we could tell,there's no parking closer than a couple of parking garages on Dartmouth,a 6-8 minute walk from the property.,,
Communication with Mario was good with the exception of no reply to an email I sent the night of arrival. Messages sent via the app were replied to almost immediately,so there's a chance he didn't see our first message.,,,,

She was friendly, very quick to respond to our inquiry and questions, and gave clear information about how get into the apartment and make ourselves at home. We arrived in the morning after a redeye, and we very much appreciated Emma's flexibility in allowing us an early check in - thank you Emma! The place is a small 3-bedroom, 1-bathroom flat on the 2nd floor. It is clean, bright and pleasant in the common area (small living room+efficiency kitchen). The kitchen has dishes available for use. The bedroom that we stayed in, B, is very small; it was tight for 2 people, but would be more comfortable for one. It has a student-type desk wedged between the closet and the bed, so the desk serves as the bedside table. The bed (which we found *very* comfortable!) is wedged between the desk and the wall/window.  It was nice to look out the window and see the next door neighbor's garden. There's an air conditioner in the window which we didn't have to use; the overhead fan made the room temperature quite pleasant. There is no mirror in the bedroom, which is unfortunate, because you do share the bathroom with guests staying in the other 2 bedrooms, so you might have to wait a while to be able to use a mirror. 1 towel is provided for each guest, but there was no bath mat. There was cleaning equipment (vacuum, mop, bucket) sitting in the common area (living room/kitchen) for the 3 days we were there. Warning to people sensitive to smells: there was a *very* strong horrible smell in the foyer and stairway of the building itself.  Made it very unpleasant to arrive \"\"home\"\" and walk up the stairs to the apartment; it made our stay much less pleasant than we would have liked"
6780313,84884110,2016-07-09,6686849,Per-Olof,The arrival and departure procedures were excellent. The description of the place was accurate and all amenities were there.
However,the neighborhood is somewhat rough. There is a seedy bar called Hollywood around the corner with drug pushers,drunkards and prostitutes also outside,around whom you have to navigate to get home; however no one approached me. During the nights leading up to and including  4 July saw the local youths swarm the street and shooting fire works around which the cars had to navigate! (The plus was that I did not have to leave home to see fireworks!) A  local grocery store attendant  told me that on one of those nights somebody had been shot on an adjacent street. I believe that travelers with weaker heart than mine should be informed before booking. When coming from outside the US,"it is not so easy to understand that the quite attractive price reflects a problem of this kind.\"",
6780313,85679725,2016-07-12,65793516,Mariví,El barrio es muy lindo y accesible desde diferentes puntos de la ciudad. Tanto la habitación como la casa en sí eran muy cómodas y espaciosas.
Emma se olvidó de enviarme por mail la forma de acceder a la casa y cuando llegué me abrió la puerta muy amablemente un señor que se hospedaba allí,es decir,si no estaba él yo no tenía forma de acceso. También la pasó lo mismo a otra pareja a la cual tuve que yo abrirles la puerta. Por lo tanto,si reservan en lo de Emma,"tengan en cuenta pedirle la clave de acceso. \"",
6780313,86009651,2016-07-14,46194733,Leon,"Emma was an excellent host. I had to reserve very last minute and I was so glad to book with her since she was very quick to answer my questions and always with a positive, welcoming vibe."
The place was well kept and clean. I would love to come back.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
6780313,86892866,2016-07-17,67538407,Elisa,"I did not get to meet Emma, but she was very prompt in replying to any questions and sorting out everything that needed to be sorted. The room (B) is bright and clean, and the flat, too, is tidy and spacious.  the bed is comfy; good when one desperately needs to sleep off a miserable jet lag! The area of Roxbury can feel a bit sketchy at night, but t's just a city, so just use your usual street smarts if you find yourself alone and wandering about after dark."
6780313,87914674,2016-07-22,57188833,Shaw,Very good
6780313,89674061,2016-07-29,29346466,Christy,"We enjoyed our trip to Boston and Emma's flat was a great launching pad. It is very close to bothe the bus lines and subway as the listing states. We also appreciated the grocery store that was a short walk away. I'd recommend not having a car if you can help it! Also, we easily visited Sam Adams brewery since we were already on the south side of town :) Sharing a bathroom with two other rooms can be tricky, so make sure you are aware of this detail when you book. The air conditioner in the room worked great and was much needed as we visited during a heat wave! I also agree the room is a bit cramped, but has all you would need including a mirror and an iron and ironing board!"
6780313,91208777,2016-08-04,28366892,Braeden,"Pros: good communication with hosts, easy access to transit (including uber), smooth check-in/out process."
Cons: unit still being worked on a bit (as of 8/16),immediate neighborhood isn't the best,linens and towels were delayed.,,,
"Note that the hosts are not on location at this unit.\"",,,,,
6780313,92208427,2016-08-08,44044809,Rodrigo,Emma was a great host. Very helpful and with great communication

13005579,77580502,2016-06-02,32789287,Tim,Bill's apartment was terrific for our trip to Boston. It's right in the middle of a charming neighborhood with much to see and do just outside. The place itself is very clean and tastefully decorated. We will definitely stay with Bill when we are in Boston again! Highly recommended!
13005579,78770716,2016-06-09,254618,Kosta,"This place is great!! It was perfectly newly renovated (apparently I was the first guest) and they did a great job. It's not a huge place, but very nicely renovated and furnished. Everything is provided, even the small details in the kitchen, including linen, towels, soap, bottled water, shampoo, wifi, the works."
There are two bedrooms in this apartment,I was expecting one. It comfortably sleeps 4. Pro-tip,if you don't need both beds,the one away from the street is much quieter.,,
The neighborhood is gorgeous as well. Really,really nice.,,,,
I was greeted by a professional manager for the place,and he waited until 1030 pm for me to get in. Very friendly,excellent service. They even let me leave my bags into the afternoon.,,,
Overall,highly recommended. About as good an AirBnB experience as I could wish for.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
13005579,79476298,2016-06-13,56587243,Jenny,"My family of four stayed at Bill's apartment for three nights and we had the best time. The neighborhood was full of energy with great restaurants and bakeries everywhere. Delicious cannoli anytime, just a block or two away. Can it get any better?"
Bill was very inviting and responsive. The apartment was comfortable and well appointed. The property management service he uses was top notch. We arrived about an hour late. The woman who met us was kind,warm and extremely pleasant.,,,,
I agree with the previous reviewers,"this was an exceptional experience. Thank you Bill!\"",,,,
13005579,82054724,2016-06-26,15960743,Lindsay,"My family and I stayed at Bill's apartment while visiting Boston and loved it. The location was amazing, right down the street from excellent restaurants, bars and stores as well as being along the Trail. While I have used Airbnb many times, I'd never had a service meet me. They were able to be flexible as our arrival time changed and gave me an overview of the house. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to stay in the heart of the city."
13005579,82802262,2016-06-29,28806888,Linda,"This is a lovely little apartment in the heart of the North End! We loved being able to walk the entire Freedom Trail from there, and enjoyed the restaurants and the people of that area of the city. Bill and Dave were very responsive to our needs."
13005579,83245862,2016-07-02,62557235,Jamie,"The apartment was beautiful.  Newly renovated, nicely decorated.  Snacks for us when we arrived.  There were even umbrellas, in case of rain.  In the little Italy neighborhood, so plenty of things to do during day or night.  Short walk to downtown and water.  Directly on the Freedom Trail, so it's easy to see the sights without a tour.  Very safe, as it's across the street from the fire department and just up the street from an urgent care facility.  Don't bother renting a car, you won't need one if you stay here.  Everything to do is so close by.  I would definitely rent this apartment again."
13005579,83988889,2016-07-05,78727011,Carl,"Great apartment in little Italy just across the street from the Paul Revere statue and a block and a half from the harbor.  Wonderful location.  Apartment was nicely appointed, very clean and in great condition.  Was a bit tight for our family of six;  we needed an air mattress since sofa is not a pullout and tiny bathroom space.  We were there only three days so that was a minor inconvenience.  Kitchen had everything needed and very clean.  The key service was very easy to work with and accommodating of our schedule and changes.  Bill answered any questions we had promptly.  We were very happy with the experience and would rent it again when in Boston.  Highly recommended.  If driving there I recommend the garage nearby on Commercial St.  Leave the car and walk everywhere as this is any easy walk to nearly any site or transit."
13005579,84405572,2016-07-07,81689129,Julie,"Our stay was wonderful!! Our family had never been to visit Boston before and only had a short time to do so. We wanted a place that was within easy walks to all we should see. This location was PERFECT! No car needed! Very Clean and was given water, snacks, coffee & tea choices. Quiet place, so we all slept great! We will definitely come again. Highly recommended!"
13005579,86093721,2016-07-14,6562459,Anne,"Great stay!  Bill's place was clean and very well maintained.  Looks exactly as pictured and big enough for our family of 4. The location was awesome and convenient. We were just a quick walk to everything, including the  best restaurants in Boston and the Freedom Trail.  A++ and would definitely stay here again."
13005579,87158187,2016-07-18,75769654,Luc,"Appartement en longeur, très bruyant, en face d'une caserne de pompiers."
Notre hôte n'était pas là pour nous recevoir mais une jeune femme d'une entreprise était là pour nous ouvrir l'appartement. L'accueil a été très succint et les draps pour le canapé étaient oubliés ( nous étions 5 et l'un devait dormir sur le canapé qui ne se déplie pas). On nous les a amené quelques minutes après. D'ailleurs le logement etait marqué pour 5 lors de notre reservation mais ensuite il etait marqué pour 4.,,,,,
Gateaux apéritifs,thé mis à disposition. Appartement très propre.,,,,
Cet appartement est en longeur,style couloir,pas très pratique pour 5.  La petite Italie est un bon quartier,bien situé pour faire les visites à pied,mais cet appartement est très bruyant,particulièrement pour la chambre située côté rue
Des rideaux opaques permettraient d'être réveillé moins tôt.,,,,,
2 chaises uniquement permettant de prendre le petit déjeuner à tour de rôle.,,,,,
Salle de bain très petite.,,,,,
Même si l'appartement était joli,avec une belle cuisine,nous avions hate de le quitter.,,,
Masques sur les yeux et boules quiez pour les oreilles de rigueur.,,,,,
"Cet appartement conviendrait plus pour 3 personnes uniquement (couchage dans la chambre du fond et canapé du salon).\"",,,,,

The apartment exactly matched the listing,in a perfect location in the North End,"and literally only steps away from all the restaurants and shops on Hanover St. We would definitely stay again. Thanks Bill !!\"",,,
13005579,88349985,2016-07-24,84936869,Kyle Patrick,The host was very responsive and helped make my first AirBnB booking go smoothly. The location was great and the apartment had everything we needed and then some. The complimentary water and snacks were great on the hot day that we arrived. I will definitely consider this listing again when revisiting Boston.
13005579,88958990,2016-07-26,3574476,Jim,The location was great and the apartment was very clean and organized.  We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend this place.  The communication was excellent and we appreciate the welcome packet.
13005579,89265191,2016-07-27,69872575,Timothy,Can't beat this location if you want to explore the North End.  Nicely maintained and furnished.  A comfortable and cozy city apartment.  We enjoyed our few days there living in the city.
13005579,90270309,2016-07-31,73430695,Leigh,"Bill's place was awesome! The communication was great and we were met at the front door with a key and instructions. We had 5 people in our group and it was a bit tight (the bathroom was really small), but I'm sure that's to be expected for a place in downtown Boston. It was very clean and overall a great experience."
13005579,92651288,2016-08-09,7023447,Gianfilippo,Medium experience.
We were a family with 3 children,we will not come back.,,,,
Location is very central and you can walk to the main boston attractions,The apt has been very clean and the key exchange was very effective.,,,,
But:,,,,,
- the apt is not for 5 people as declared,you have a sofa that does not pull out and there is not a true living room. So very unconfortable for the figth person;,,,,
- one of the room (the one that looks to hanover street) is very noisy,so if you are sensitive to noise better to choose another apt,,,,
- the bathroom is like the one in an airplane,too little !,,,,

Nice walk to the waterfront as well. Clean and attractive apartment but very small bathroom. Excellent communication with the host, all went smoothly!"
13005579,97996810,2016-08-29,91417437,Sheila,Bill's communication was brilliant when booking and he did everything he could to make our stay a great one.  The apartment is in an excellent location; easy to walk everywhere. It was really clean and the welcome pack was most appreciated. Particularly liked the information on restaurants and sights.
4828640,38081068,2015-07-12,916573,Dawnell,Our travel plans got screwed up and our estimated arrival time kept changing.  We stayed in touch with David and he was very understanding.   We loved the area.  The house has so much character!  Our room was exactly as advertised.  The bed was of high quality and very comfortable providing a good night's sleep.  David made us feel very welcomed and took excellent care of us.  We hope to stay here again on our next visit to the area.
4828640,39842596,2015-07-26,38426219,Oladipo,David was very good host. I felt very welcome at his place and totally enjoyed my stay.
The description David gave was perfect; so it was easy locating his apartment. Commuting to and fro his place was easy and cheap as his house is a few minutes walk away from the train/trolley/bus station,,,,,
He gave me a good tour of his house and also the neighbourhood. The neighbourhood had all the essential places (laundry,supermarket,pharmacy,banks,restaurants etc.) .,
David was so kind that he took his time on several occasions to help me locate places within and outside Boston.,,,,,
Staying at his place was my first experience with airbnb and I'd love to keep using airbnb.,,,,,

4828640,40048527,2015-07-27,8731526,Georges,David was most helpful and everything was ready for us. Room had two windows so good air circulation- bed was clean and comfy - bathroom was recently modernized and was pleasant / full access to house and easy street parking - Old Mills area is quite neat with many restaurants and services / the Flat Black coffee shop is across the street and is recommended- we took Nepunset river bike path to Citadel Park and downtown- recommend and would return -

We totally appreciated the wonderful morning coffee and the English muffins with jam that he provided.  It was about a 15 minute walk to the subway (the T) or a 5 minute walk to the Trolley, so the location was fine.  I would recommend a stay with David any time!"
4828640,42469231,2015-08-13,19170525,Lilian,"I had a great experience staying at David's home. The room was well stocked and he gave us great tips for traveling in Boston.

The online description was to a tee.  Close to public transportation and small shops.  Clean area with friendly and helpful neighbours.  David makes you feel right at home with the little extras available to you in your room and the kitchen.  I especially felt this way with all the Ikea items around.  I love to shop at Ikea :)"

4828640,49990570,2015-10-08,42194374,Jessica,"David was a very nice host, who has a realy cool and big house. The location is perfect to visit  Boston. It only takes 20-30 minutes to Downtown with the tram. David arranged that we could check in early and dropped our bageges. Also there were little things like waterbottles, peanuts and cracker in our room and he offered some breakfast like orangejuice, bagels, oats. We enjoyed the stay."
4828640,50367831,2015-10-11,6671024,Elizabeth,"The house is large and gorgeous (140 years old!) and the neighborhood was very walkable - T, coffee, ice cream, restaurants, wine/beer, and grocery all within a few blocks! David was friendly when we met him the first night but definitely gave us our privacy, which we appreciated. He left SO many great items in case we'd forgotten - my boyfriend really appreciated the shaving cream, for example. They also went on an extra trip to the grocery store around the corner when they were running out of orange juice so it'd be available for our breakfast (bagels, oatmeal, peanut butter...)"
Some things to note - 1) The house is older,so the stairs are a little steep (the price of high ceilings!),"and the bathtub is a gorgeous claw foot tub but you'll need to be able to keep your balance since there's no wall to grab in there. 2) My 6'0\"\" boyfriend hit his head a few times the first night on a low hanging light fixture just outside our room",so watch out if you're tall. 3) The bathroom is on the other side of the house from the room,"with two stairs to go down. So definitely stay here so long as your balance is good enough to groggily get your way to and from the bathroom in the middle of the night!\"",
4828640,50658932,2015-10-13,21073549,Jim,Was exactly as described. Lovely house with beautiful color scheme throughout. Best we have experienced.
4828640,51859728,2015-10-24,39578548,Andrew,My fiancé and I stayed at David's house for 2 nights during our time in Boston. Although we didn't meet him due to our different schedules we had a great time! The house was very nice and a 5min walk to Milton station which was handy. We especially liked the fact he left out a selection of things for breakfast.
4828640,52262355,2015-10-27,27912045,John,David's home was lovely and very spacious!  Decorated very tastefully and the kitchen was generously stocked for breakfast.  Would love to come and stay again!

The home is beautiful and in such a great location, and David is a terrific host. There is a communal breakfast station where he leaves food for his guests, and in the room there were additional snacks as well as a host of toiletries and even some medicine that came in very handy over the course of our stay. David is also very responsive and helpful which is great as I had a last minute change of plans with my arrival time. We would definitely stay again and recommend David's place very highly to anyone looking to stay in the area!"

4828640,53787996,2015-11-12,23086015,Kelsey,David's home is absolutely lovely! The neighborhood was great and everything you could possibly need is in walking distance. The public transportation system is pretty easy to navigate and just a short walk from the house.
While I didn't get a chance to meet David in person,"he went out of his way to make sure that I was comfortable and had everything I needed during my stay.  I would definitely recommend this listing for anyone traveling to the Dorchester area.\"",,,,

4828640,54549973,2015-11-21,47204807,Hairong,David wasn't be there when I arrived his home but he made sure there had someone to welcome the guest. Matt answered all of my questions at the first night when i arrived.
The house is large and gorgeous,there are 9 rooms including TV room/ Reading room/ Dinning room/ Reception room ect. The complete facility and comfortable disposal of the room will bring me ambience at home.,,,,
And the neighborhood was very walkable - T (Subway),coffee,supermarket,restaurants,wine/beer,and grocery all within a few blocks!
The house was really quiet so if you need to rest,it is the best place. And the host (David and Matt) are so considerate for tourist. They provides City maps and travel guide,and even some coupons,medicine(tablet),bagged biscuit/raisin for the guest.,
It was pity for me,Because i am visiting scholar in MIT. So i have to go to school everyday. It have to spend 45-50mins to (URL HIDDEN) a bit far but it's still convenient transportation for me.,,,,
"But I believe it will be good place for tourist who is just visiting the city and stay 2-3 nights in Boston.\"",,,,,
4828640,54790201,2015-11-23,12848879,Jacinthe,"Beautiful and Huge place. David couldn't be there when we arrived but he made sure we had someone to welcome us. Matt answered all of our questions. It was really quiet so if you need to rest, it is the best place."
"We got more than we expected. There was various products for the shower in our room and a great variety of food for our breakfast to provide us with the energy we needed to go around Boston for a while before going to a nice place to eat in Boston.\"",,,,,
4828640,55129655,2015-11-28,43551006,Rudi,"We stayed at David's house and had a great experience. Unfortunately I interrupted their Thanksgiving dinner to check in but he was very helpful and very patient. We liked the room, clean and tidy. We had breakfast fixings every morning. It was very close and convinient for us. Would stay there again."
4828640,57802239,2015-12-29,50071858,Vickie,"David's house was lovely.  I love old houses with beautiful wood floors and gorgeous light fixtures. It was convenient to be able to park in the small dead- end street off the side. He was away for our visit, but left detailed instructions.  He checked up on us by texting.  There were lots of little extras in the room.  It was a very nice neighborhood."
4828640,59144216,2016-01-07,50776449,Destarte,I had a great experience staying with David. He was a very friendly and accommodating host. He provided breakfast and was easily accessible for any questions I had about my stay and the surrounding area.
4828640,62665271,2016-02-15,17643708,Lisa,"If you really want to experience something special, I recommend staying at David's 150 year old home! Very nicely decorated and furnished too!"
4828640,66736786,2016-03-24,59931899,Orla,Extremely happy with our stay here. Lovely area and David was very helpful. Lots of small touches that made our stay all the more enjoyable! Would highly recommend to others!
4828640,69706765,2016-04-12,22343220,Kyle,"David's place was great. Super convenient and excellent communication. Great little amenities provided such as an IPhone charger on the bed, extra toiletries and just a generally cool place. Quiet and just what I needed."
4828640,71298937,2016-04-24,67986606,Helen,"I had a great experience staying at David's. David is very kind. His house is very clean and neat. The room I stayed in had two big windows which was very nice when sunshine hits in the morning. I especially appreciate that the check-in time was flexible and he offered breakfast. However, it was a little scary to walk there after 9pm since the area was very quite at that time."
4828640,74116629,2016-05-13,18289322,Grace,"David is responsive and always willing to help out whenever we had a problem. The place is huge, tastefully decorated and close to the train and trolley stops to go downtown. Overall we had a good time staying at David's house."
But there are two complaints we do need to raise: 1. There's no dressing mirror in the house,"which can be a problem for ladies while traveling and visiting friends. There was only one desk in the room. 2. David's friend Matt was taking care of the house and guests while he was away. We felt unwelcome by his cold and distant attitude. It was probably the only unpleasant experience we had in Boston. \"",,,,
4828640,74613205,2016-05-16,70254651,Anna,"Very nice home, true to listing is a large, historic house with nice garden in front. The neighborhood was very pleasant, and we were able to walk a few blocks to a nice cafe. Also very accessible to public transportation. Traffic through 11 pm at night, and quite a bit of road noise which may be louder than you are used to if not from the city. However they do provide a fan which can provide some white noise. Room very sunny in the morning."
4828640,75287848,2016-05-20,41638100,Beth,"We had a lovely stay at David's while visiting boston. David was away with family so we never met him however Matt was a lovely host. He was friendly, answered all our questions and had a very cute new puppy we could play with! The room was lovely- spotless and sunny.  The location was fantastic (try the home made ice cream shop just round the corner)! All in all a great stay."
4828640,77275267,2016-05-31,70736041,Kilo,"David is a very nice host! The location is very near to the metro station but it can take up to 1 hour to go to downtown sometime. The host is very sweet that they even prepared daily usage stuff just in case if we forgot to bring. Although the door of the room can't really closed, and the bath room cannot be locked, David would never bother us and gave us a great room of privacy."
As my first experience in Airbnb,"David gave me a great confidence on further using Airbnb! \"",,,,
4828640,78474089,2016-06-06,66490954,Annie,"Myself and my boyfriend stayed in David's house for a week. It was lovely, great locating only a 5 min walk to the T station, Milton. There are also a few nice restaurants only a block away as well as a star market across the road! David left out food and coffee etc for breakfast which was so handy and a nice touch. The bed was comfortable and the bedroom is lovely and sunny! David also left clean towels for us and water, tour guides, etc. Only thing missing from the room was a mirror to get ready at. Overall, a lovely stay and a very friendly, helpful host!"
4828640,79104107,2016-06-11,75447817,Danielle,"David was a amazing host! Very friendly, responded promptly to any inquiry. Everything in the house was as listed. The place was large enough to give you total privacy, yet David was available if you needed to shoot the breeze for a moment. We felt at home and very comfortable. The chocolates on the bed was a nice touch. In the room was travelers frequently forgotten items like an extra toothbrush, razors, mini lotion. Also fresh linen and towels greeted our stay. I was given Uber and lift codes and excellent suggestions for our visit. I would love to stay again next time I come to the area. Thank you for an awesome stay."
4828640,80723852,2016-06-19,28173977,Kristina,"David and Matt were great hosts, they invited us spontaneously to have dinner with them and their friends. In the mornings, we were invited to share the kitchen to have a small breakfast."
The room itself was good for 2 nights,maybe a little small and bright in the morning,but nothing which seriously bothered us.,,,
The shared bathroom was clean.,,,,,
The neighbourhood was fine,with some bars and restaurants around,"the city can be reached via metro.\"",,,
4828640,81643657,2016-06-24,23766158,Dan,Great location in the center of Dorchester. Close to restaurants and shops. Nice running trail nearby. Room was clean and private. Old house charm. Host left you to your own.
4828640,82372600,2016-06-27,8594097,Francois,The room is perfect and clean. The apartment is well located: 10 min drive to Boston downtown.
The neighborhood is nice with a good coffee shop and safe mood.,,,,,
The hosts don't talk too much but it's ok since you don't visit to make friends.,,,,,
"We enjoyed our stay at their place it's a good choice.\"",,,,,
4828640,84234193,2016-07-06,79379573,Ashley,"This was my first experience with AirBnB so I was feeling a bit hesitant. However, it was perfect and I feel at ease about using Airbnb in the future. David was very accommodating. It was easy to get in touch with him with my questions from the beginning. He wasn't there when we arrived but he made sure we were able to get into the house. That evening, he made himself available to answer our touristy questions. We were even allowed to store our bags there until we left later that next afternoon/early evening. The house is close to public transportation, clean, and I felt safe staying there. I would definitely recommend using this Airbnb!"
4828640,91311318,2016-08-04,35240060,Scott,David and Matt were excellent hosts! The room was as described and the house was close to several nice restaurants. David was very quick to answer emails and accommodating. I would recommend!
4828640,99681302,2016-09-05,24059316,Harish,We had a comfortable stay. David was friendly and provided with all the necessary things. He would definitely recommend his place for stay if you are visiting Boston
5191658,27654066,2015-03-09,7861865,William,"This is an absolutely beautiful apartment in a great location, particularly if you are doing something at the convention center, which is just a short walk away. I think I may have been the first person to stay here, as everything was in pristine condition upon move in, and the washing machine still had the instruction manual in it. The apartment is very tastefully decorated and the high ceilings and brick walls give it a wonderful sense of space."
I did not give the apartment 5 stars,"because I think there were some \"\"opening day issues\"\"","which I expect will be resolved for future guests. And hosts were good at attending to issues rapidly to resolve them. I did not give it 3 stars because the apartment was far from middling -- it was very nice. 4 stars seems fair to me. \"",,,
5191658,28134735,2015-03-18,28112168,Lisa,It was a very nice loft and a perfect location to walk all over Boston!  Host was very helpful and met us when we arrived and helped us find convenient parking.  Would love to stay there again!

5191658,33494308,2015-05-29,26911242,T,"I was in town for a conference, and this location is great, only 7 mins or so walking to the boston convention and exhibit center; super convenient for me. It was also close to the south station, where we could take the T pretty much wherever we wanted to get to. Quiet location, and the place looks very new. I wished that it had more overhead lights in the bedroom, dining and living areas - all lighted by either table or floor lamps. This was fine but my personal preference is to have more lighting in general."
Could have also done with some hand soap for the bathroom,and we ended up purchasing laundry detergent to run some laundry. There should be plenty left for other folks in the next few months! I didnt find any kitchen knifes for slicing/dicing,but overall am pretty happy to have stayed here. Comfortable,quiet,"and convenient to get around where i needed to.\"",
5191658,44403857,2015-08-26,8843919,Larry,"I rented this apartment for 3 months (the summer).  As you can see from the photos, the place is beautiful.  It's a great location if you want to experience the Seaport District of Boston.  Within a 15 minute walking distance there's many awesome restaurants, and more keep opening as this area develops.  I had zero issues with the apartment.  There is a building manager (Chris) who was super responsive to me when I realized one evening that I'd lost my key in an Uber car.  It was after 10 pm and I texted Chris and he met me 10 minutes later at the front door with a new key.  I highly recommend working with Monica and renting this unit."
5191658,46465911,2015-09-11,19835029,Alicia,"\"Monica had great communication with me leading up to the stay.  The building & apartment are \"\"hotel-like\"\" clean. It seems that no one lives in the unit so ALL the dresser drawers"

We were in town for 3 nights and everything we were looking for was in close proximity. Very cool building and Monica was very helpful in providing information regarding places to go and see during out stay.,,,,,
"Thanks!\"",,,,,
5191658,49918419,2015-10-07,1645142,Gordon,"Thanks for the stay and the great tips in the area - tried a few places in the days I was there. Row 34 is good for a boy who likes craft beer so I may have gotten a little tipsy there one night! Easy to get in, great close location to the conference centre."
5191658,51431845,2015-10-20,30087058,Joyce,Monica was an excellent host.  She was very responsive in answering my questions prior to my arrival and also recommended some restaurants in the neighborhood.  She was also quick in answering to my request for additional set of keys after checking in.
Apartment is located in South Boston an older part of the city but my understanding it is the new up and coming area with a lot of start up companies and trendy restaurants/bars.  It's a short 5-10 minutes walk to financial district and easy access to main highways. There is a parking garage behind the apartment that has reasonable rate.  The streets are quiet with not a lot of traffic.  The occasional noise come from over flying airplanes and music from bar in the evening.  The building is very quiet,I don't recall meeting any other residents in the public area during my stay.,,,,
The studio apartment is spacious for up to two adults. It is clean with tasteful furniture.  The bed room comes with a queen size bed which can be crowded for two.  The bathroom is spacious but host does not provide shampoo,body soap etc,so bring your own supply.  Laundry detergent is available even though I brought my own as advised from previous reviews.,,,
Couple areas of improvement: the studio is too dark in the evening.  The brightest area is the bathroom.  There are only two small standing lamps in the living room and two table lamps in the bed room. It was hard for me to work or read because of limited lighting.  The other thing is,only local TV channels are available. So no business,sports,and news channels. However the wifi works perfectly so I could check what was going on in the world and followed MLB playoffs on line.,,
Other than these two minor points,I had a great experience with the host,the studio and the neighborhood.,,,

Monica is a great host and was very clear about keys and access. She was also informative and helpful by suggesting local restaurants and bars.,,,,,
My favourites are the Blue Dragon across the street and Bastille Kitchen which is downstairs from the apartment. Both of these are famous among my Boston friends and I can see why that is.,,,,,
I travel to Boston frequently and I can't wait to return to this apartment.,,,,,
"Thank you Monica. \"",,,,,

It's a very quick and easy walk to the historic district and if you're planning on heading far, (why would you need to!) the train stations were close as well."
The home was pristine and filled with all of the essentials. We were welcomed with a bottle of white wine and an instructive binder filled with the apartment info and things/places to see around the city. It was also updated with things going on the weekend of our stay,super helpful!,,,,

It was clean, comfortable, bigger than we expected, and had fast wifi. He even left out some hotel-sized soap and shampoo, and clean towels, which was fortunate because some of the girls forgot their own. The only issue was that the shower water was cold, but he had it checked and said a plumber would be needed to fix it, so it was out of his hand and hopefully people deciding to stay in the future will not have this issue. Everything else was amazing."
The house was also conveniently only a few blocks away from the subway station allowing us to easily travel to the downtown Boston area. If we return to Boston,"I would definitely choose to stay here again.\"",,,,
3888360,65886018,2016-03-17,54396181,John,"My friends and I spent spring break in Boston. I think the house is very good for us, it's not expensive. I like to stay there again!"
3888360,66227215,2016-03-20,53543134,Kath,"My friends and I stayed at Yilkal's place 3 nights. It's a beautiful and big place, very clean. There's a bus station near, making it easy to go dowtown Boston...!"
There was some hotel size shampoo and soap but,not enough clean towel for 6 people. There's not a lot of stuff in the kitchen,enough to be able to eat,but don't expect to be able to cook.,,
He left us some bagel that was expired...,,,,,
And finaly,one of the bed was really hard... but I guess that we slept on the bedbase because when we looked back at the picture of the room,"the matress was missing. That was probably the \"\"extra\"\" matress","that we would get since we were 7. He brought us more pillows while we were there and some toilet paper that he left at the entrance inside the house.\"",,
3888360,67052974,2016-03-26,15920477,Wai Yan Moe,The house was very large and spacious for the 5 of us that lived in it. It was clean and Yikal was an excellent host. He had great communication and made sure to look after all our needs. Highly recommend his listing and would definitely book again!
3888360,68470311,2016-04-05,2668751,Brad,"The house was exactly like the pictures. Very spacious and the bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable. I was not used to all the road noise and did not sleep well but that can be explained because I am from a small quiet town and not used to big city traffic. The owner was very quick to respond to any questions or issues and was very nice. I would probably stay in a hotel next time because it was really too much house for 1 person and about a 30 minute walk from downtown. But if my whole family comes to Boston, I would definitely stay here again. The place is close to public transportation. Great price and great home."
3888360,68926346,2016-04-07,64636236,Christina,"We visited Boston for medical reasons. We chose this home because of the easy access to the hospitals. It was more than we expected. The home was comfortable, and had everything we needed. There were generous extra touches with coffee and fruit upon our arrival. Access to the community and tourist sites were easy to get to from this location. Thank you for shoveling the snow after the storm. It was a great surprise to come back to after a long day. They take very good care of the guests from behind the scenes. Thank you again for sharing your home, and making me feel comfortable during my stay. Fabulous communication!"
3888360,69347076,2016-04-10,58326783,Shelbie,"The townhouse was great! Convenient to Boston, and we'll kept up. We really enjoyed our stay, and Yilkal was great at communicating with us."
3888360,70730546,2016-04-20,43874204,John,"This is a great place that is very spacious and includes everything you would need. The location is great being only a 10 minute ride to downtown. They supply you with towels, toiletries, bottled water, and anything else you would expect at a hotel. This house could easily sleep six people without feeling cramped. Also, the owner is very responsive and willing to help in any way to make your trip better. Whether it be restaurant advice or questions about the house he is very helpful. I definitely recommend staying here."
3888360,71507462,2016-04-25,59012384,Justin,Yilkal was very supportive (even though we didn't have any questions!)
Everything was as described,and we had no issues. He provided us with an alternate address to put into GPS since the actual address often comes up wrong. The building was very easy to find.,,,,
There were towels/soap/shampoo available for use.,,,,,
We didn't spend much time in the place during our visit since we had a busy schedule,"but it certainly lived up to our needs!\"",,,,
3888360,71691264,2016-04-27,6938276,Laurie,"Very spacious and clean house with 3 bedrooms which are all very comfortable (great beds!). Very well equipped as well (oven, dishes, soap, linens...). The wifi works perfectly in all the rooms. It is very to park your car and the directions provided by Yilkal made it easy to find the house."
For the transports,there is a bus station near the house (Dudley station) where buses can take downtown (40 minutes) or they can take you to the nearest subway (Ruggles).,,,,
We didn't meet Yilkal but we exchanged by messages (which he always answered very quickly) and we had his wife's number in cases we needed something or recommendations.,,,,,
All around great experience. Thank you!,,,,,
Maison très spacieuse et propre avec 3 chambres toutes aussi confortables l'une que l'autre (les lits sont supers!). Maison très bien équipée (four,vaisselle,savon,linges...). Le wifi fonctionne parfaitement dans toutes les pièces. Il est facile de garer votre voiture et les directions envoyées par Yilkal nous ont permis de trouver le logement facilement.,,
Pour les transports,il y a une station de bus proche (Dudley station) où des bus peuvent vous emmener dans le centre (40 minutes) ou bien jusqu'à la station de métro la plus proche (Ruggles).,,,,
Nous n'avons pas rencontré Yilkal mais nous avons échangé des messages (auxquels il répondait toujours très vite) et nous avions le numéro de sa femme en cas de question et envie de recommandations.,,,,,
"Une bonne expérience en bref. Merci!\"",,,,,
3888360,74551155,2016-05-15,10417623,Angie,Yikal's space was clean and very comfortable for my whole family when we came into town for graduation. We had plenty of places to sleep and more than enough clean towels.
It was walking distance to public transportation and had great wi-fi. Also,"it was very easy to communicate with our host.\"",,,,
3888360,75188847,2016-05-19,68715077,Matthew,The house was great it had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. It was clean and had all the amenities of a hotel besides maid service. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend this to anyone who is visiting Boston.
3888360,76342864,2016-05-26,57800902,Brittany,"Host was very inviting and answered all questions. Listing was just as it stated, with a gorgeous view of the city. Very clean and organized. In the neighborhood there is a police department. Public transport station is within walking distance. Overall a few minor things l, would definitely book with them again!"
3888360,76755942,2016-05-29,42502167,Maria,"Great experience. The place was perfect for 6! Beds were comfy. Air conditioners were great for a hot hot day in Boston. It was really nice having the 1 1/2 baths's. The living room was very comfortable to relax in. Nice space! Yilkal was easy to communicate with and was responsive to our needs! Nice kitchen but it did have limited fixings, Bring mixing bowls and salt and pepper! It did have coffee which was a great touch!"
3888360,80344441,2016-06-17,62442279,Roberto,"Nos gusto la ubicación, estaba relativamente cerca del centro  que es lo que  nos interesaba visitar. Tiene lugar para estacionar el coche."
La casa estaba muy limpia y confortable. Las camas,cobertores sabanas y toallas muy nuevas muy cómodas.,,,,
Todo funciono muy bien.,,,,,
Nosotros éramos 4 personas y  todos estuvimos muy contentos.,,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3888360,81003430,2016-06-20,22685185,Issac,The house is just like it in the picture. The location is not bad to access downtown.
3888360,82962479,2016-06-30,43023040,Cathy,We had the most amazing time in Yilkal's town house. 5 of us travelled from Ireland and stayed for 8 nights in June 2016.
The house was spotless and had everything we needed for our stay. Yilkal even dropped over a BBQ to us though we never got to use it!!,,,,,
The house is a great location for touring Boston and on Yilkal's advice we used the Uber taxi service for getting into the city and that worked out at around $15/20 for the 5 of us.,,,,,
Yilkal was the perfect host and was at the end of the phone day and night if needed. We even had the pleasure of meeting his two beautiful children,Jonathan & Bethany.,,,,
"I couldn't recommend this  accommodation enough if you are planning a trip to Boston. A truly memorable trip in great accommodation with a very attentive host  10/10\"",,,,,
3888360,83450249,2016-07-03,62769662,Ying,The house is cozy and in good condition. We had good time here. Yikal is also helpful in guiding us.
3888360,89989137,2016-07-30,57430028,Adaja,"We liked our stay at Yilkals place very much! He was such a kind and attentive host, and did everything he could to make our stay as great as it could be. He even brought us some some cookies and extra water for the tap. The house is a great place to stay, at least more than enough space for everyone when you're a group of 6 like we were. It has a great kitchen if you want to cook, which we appreciated and used very much. Would highly recommend it and definitely book it again!"
3888360,90926247,2016-08-03,27844066,Michel,"Appartement bien situé, conforme à la description, propre, équipé de tout ce qui est nécessaire pour faciliter un séjour agréable."
Yilkal a été un hôte sympathique,à la hauteur et répondant à toutes nos demandes efficacement.,,,,
Je recommande !,,,,,
Michel,"Québec.\"",,,,
3888360,91325624,2016-08-04,43843960,Isabelle,"L'appartement était conforme aux photos et les échanges de mails avec Yilkal ont été efficaces et utiles. Toutefois, il y a une marge de progrès pour rendre l'appartement agréable. Ce que nous avons le moins aimé c'est le quartier sans charme mais quand même assez près de Boston centre en taxi ( 10 à  15 minutes). Nous aurions aimé avoir plus de renseignement à notre arrivée car, en l'absence du propriétaire, nous ne savions pas comment aller dans le centre ni où se trouvaient les commerces les plus proches."
3888360,92183716,2016-08-07,87270308,Daniel,"The host made me feel welcomed! He informed us about anything we would need to know about staying for the weekend. A few of my friends and I came up from New York City for an Urban Squash Alumni event and it was amazing. The photos were accurate, and it was a beautiful home. There were neighbors but nobody bothered us during our stay and vice versa. Checking in and out was easy as the host was very responsive through texts throughout the whole stay at any hour of the day. Would recommend to anybody wanting to enjoy a stay in a nice, spacious but cozy home. Thanks again!"
3888360,96407232,2016-08-22,54370022,Jaime,"We had a great stay at this home with our family of six. The host's attention to detail is outstanding: a welcome note and delicious sweets were awaiting us on the table. The pantry was stocked with various teas, brand name coffees (incl. Starbucks), fridge had beer and condiments. Kitchen had all utensils and pots/pans. The home was very clean and you also had at your disposal all cleaning supplies if needed. Toiletries were also at hand, as well as plenty of clean towels and sheets. The location was very accesible and only a few minutes from downtown  (we were driving).   Communication with Yilkal was prompt and he was always very attentive.  We were extremely happy with our stay and highly recommend Yilkal's place."
3888360,98126494,2016-08-29,86400057,Thomas,I was extremely satisfied with my stay. I couldn't have picked a better place to stay for a last minute trip
"We booked on Thursday and arrived Friday. Surprised his place was available. He did a great job and even left us a welcoming cheese tray and a six pack of beer. The place was very clean and spacious. The price was way cheaper than I would've paid for a hotel. \"",,,,,
11343485,89033208,2016-07-26,5190804,Seth,"The good:  great location, great street and amazing apt, I felt like I went back in time to the days of Ben Franklin- one of the more unique airbnb's I've stayed in which is what the experience is all about for me."
The bad:,,,,,
No Wifi however there is a Starbucks down the street that I used.  The 90 degree heat was a little challenging without AC however the owner supplied me with plenty of fans.  The apt could have used the touch of a cleaning lady as well but nothing that was unmanageable.,,,,,
"Overall I would stay again and also recommend others if they were sold on the photos.  Krysti was also very pleasurable to meet.  \"",,,,,
11343485,90204863,2016-07-31,75619350,Laura,"I really enjoyed our stay at Krysti's place! The apartment was clean and very spacious, and it's located in a beautiful and historic neighborhood. Check-in and check-out was very easy and flexible, and we were provided with towels, toiletries, and an ample supply of bottled water. The only downsides are the lack of AC and wifi, but these ended up not really being an issue for us. The weather was relatively cool and there were a lot of fans to help out, and I was able to log on to the local xfinity wifi without too much trouble. This is a great place; would highly recommend staying here!"
11343485,90585514,2016-08-01,86421791,Patrice,The location is great and the host was accomadating with times. A little more attention to cleanliness and upkeep would make this a more inviting place.
11343485,90937388,2016-08-03,64230582,Matt,The place was great and exactly as described from the posting. The neighborhood and location was great - one block from the State House and right around the corner from the Common. Krysti was very responsive and met us at the place when we arrived to give us the keys and go over the amenities.
11343485,91248129,2016-08-04,85738546,Jean-Philippe,Very cool and helpful host that guided us to the cheap parking and all facilities in the area. Appartment close to downtown by walk. Amazing patio. Nothing bad to say! Recommend it.
11343485,92373371,2016-08-08,85625087,Sarah,Amazing location a block or two away from the state house!
11343485,92878198,2016-08-10,61855249,Tim,Rustic but great... The location and neighborhood could not have been better ... Krysti was readily available but never intrusive ... Would stay there again in a heartbeat... Had a blast
11343485,93211622,2016-08-11,11370156,Elaina,"Krysti's place was amazing! It was very easy to check in and close to Boston Commons. We were able to walk downtown really easily. The neighborhood felt very safe. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and private. Krysti was so helpful, she even found some glasses we had lost and brought them back to us. We definitely recommend!"
11343485,93944012,2016-08-14,939928,Liz,"Krysti was great, very communicative and made check in a breeze.  Also put in an air conditioner for us because it was really hot - and we really appreciated that extra effort."
11343485,94947421,2016-08-17,87044845,Alex,"We enjoyed our stay. We wanted to experience staying in historical area and walking in downtown at night so it was a great choice to us. We knew there were no wifi, TV, and air conditioner before booking since those were not big concern to us. But surprisingly we had a portable air conditioner in the bedroom. We had a comfortable night there."
"Krysti was very nice and friendly. Thank you.\"",,,,,
11343485,95137392,2016-08-18,11345466,Julie,Krysti was very helpful and accomodating and answered all my questions - thank you!  I felt I was taken care of and welcome.  Apt is spacious. This is an expensive neighborhood near Mass Gen Hospital.  I came for an appointment and it was the perfect place for my one night's stay!
11343485,96315173,2016-08-22,86059208,Rebecca,"My friends and I visited Boston for the weekend. Krysti's apartment was in the PERFECT location. Krysti was very accommodating with keeping our luggage, before and after check in/out times, which helped us enjoy our short visit even more. The apartment was clean and perfect for our needs. Communication was also easy and consistent with Krysti."
11343485,96574345,2016-08-23,4794380,Sue Ellen,"\"Krysti's apartment was perfect for an overnight stay in Boston for my friend and I.  The location was great; just a few blocks from Boston Commons and a rail station if you don't want to walk around.  The apartment is clean and back patio is great to relax and enjoy sitting outside after a long day of walking The Freedom Trail and exploring the town.  There is no TV or WiFi, but as Krysti pointed out, there's a Starbucks down the street that has WiFi, and I didn't miss the TV; too busy exploring!  Krysti was EXTREMELY accommodating for us to leave our bags on the second day and quick to respond.  If I'm looking for a place to stay again in Boston, I'd definitely pick this \"\"Beacon Hill Gem.\"\" \""
11343485,98369614,2016-08-30,92674551,Cory,The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9770477,61171436,2016-02-01,50533429,Lucien,"Staying at Bernie's place was a great experience. The apartment already had many essentials and toiletries so I didn't have to get my own the second I arrived and it was clean and in good condition. The one time I needed help with an issue with the cable, his staff were available and helped me right away. The one issue is that the listing didn't showcase the small amount of natural lighting but other than that everything was as expected."
9770477,67642926,2016-03-30,56263869,Jessica,"The place was in convenient place that was within walking distance of starbucks, walgreens, delis and the Hynes convention center. It was clean and comfortable."
9770477,68457920,2016-04-05,1790491,Yaakov,"The apartment was lovely, well located and in a quiet neighborhood. The building too was clean and quiet. Inside, the place has all the comforts, but it requires some maintenance. The entrance door needs some work, for example. When I arrived there was no indication anywhere of the WiFi password or network name - eventually I understood it was because of the broken antenna of the wireless router. The office on 463 Beacon St was generally helpful, but they seemed to have no clue as to what the wifi data would be for the apt on 511 Beacon. Of course these are details, partially insignificant, but which made my stay just a little less pleasant. The flat is great - I would suggest to invest more in the cleaning maid or company, for it was a little dusty. For a single or a couple it is just the perfect solution for a few nights in a lovely city."
9770477,70680305,2016-04-19,34827266,Timothy,The studio was exactly what I was looking for. It was perfect for a two day stay in the Back Bay. It was a great location to walk to the Boston Marathon.
9770477,87690472,2016-07-21,973521,David,"Great location in Back Bay, close to Fenway, which was exactly what we were looking for in our 2 night stay. Despite issues with the original room, accommodations were made for a comparable room, also basement level, but a little darker than the posted room.  Great overall experience and value. Would book again."
9770477,89339659,2016-07-28,81769856,David,Good localization. Very close to fenway and universities.
9770477,92023588,2016-08-07,81693236,Robert,Decent small apartment. Could have been cleaner. Couch and bed were uncomfortable. Bring your own pillow and blanket.
"But a decent place. Served the purpose. Nice quiet building.\"",,,,,
9770477,94065612,2016-08-14,84995164,Hannah,"The location of the apartment could not be better. Located on a Quiet street it's only a 10 min walk from the train and Fenway Park. The apartment itself is in need of a thorough scrubbing/cleaning and needs some repairs. When we checked in (the keys were at the 463 Guest House further up the street which is another lodging facility Bernie is associated with) they assured us that everything was ready for us. Not true. The bathroom has sever bad mildew spots and the sheets on the bed were stained and did not appear clean (long black women's hair in them). We did not see this until after midnight so a rather uncomfortable night for us until the next day. When I went back to the 463 guest house the front desk was extremely apologetic and provided a clean set of sheets for me to put on the bed. All told, 3.5 out of 5 for the apartment. Again, it needs to be cleaned and have some repairs done but that's all that keeps this from being 5 stars."
12904318,93723502,2016-08-13,75111475,Mark,"The place was nice.  Comfortable bed, full kitchen stocked with dishes and being two blocks from the T is a good location.  I never actually met Jean but she was very responsive to email and did what she could to resolve problems remotely."

851927,59399987,2016-01-10,51107869,Yinan,"Me and my girlfriend absolutely enjoyed our two weeks stay at Nina's apartment, and Nina was so helpful and friendly. The location was the best. It's a 2-min walk to the nearest T station and 5-min walk to newbury street. The bedroom was so cozy and the bathroom was so clean. I would highly recommend Nina's place to everyone who is trying to find a place like home while being able to travel around Boston."
851927,64773480,2016-03-08,52574144,Kim,"Nina was an amazing host! She made me feel extremely welcome. She's easy to talk to, responsive, friendly, accommodating and all-around cool person. I'm so glad to that I got to meet her."
I absolutely love the location of the apartment. The Back Bay T Station is a 3 minute walk,the Copley T station is 5-10 minute walk. Between the orange line and green line,it was so easy to get around the city. Plus,there's Newbury,the Mall and so many restaurants/bars close by. If you're looking to explore the city,this is definitely the location to be.
The apartment itself is airy,spacious,clean and modern. There is a dining table for two by the windows,and I loved sitting there and enjoying the view of the brownstones.,,
Overall,it was an awesome experience!,,,,

It took me about 30 minutes to get to Longwood Medical Area in the morning. Basic cooking supplies are available - made meals several times throughout the week, and the apartment is a few minutes away from all of the bars/restaurants on Boylston & Newbury street. I walked back several times late at night and was completely fine; taxi and car services were able to find the apt easily. Neighbors are courteous and friendly; the apartment was super clean. Internet was high speed and I never had a problem. Would definitely come back!"

8063870,49367699,2015-10-03,787325,Mike,"The actual condo is very nice and the amenities and location are top notch.  However, there is a MASSIVE construction project going on right outside the window (it looks like they are building another condo building).  Pile driving started between 7:15am and 7:30am every day with jackhammering going well past midnight some evenings.  None of that was noted in the description when I booked."
8063870,51367791,2015-10-19,19350201,Leola,"Excellent experience. Mike was prompt with communication, and provided detailed information which made checking in very easy. The apartment I stayed in is evidently one of several in this building. The actual furnishings looked different from the photos, but were very nice, and of similar quality to those pictured. The description is accurate. It's a comfortable, nicely furnished space, and very clean. There's a Target and a StarMarket grocery store next door -- very convenient! The concierge was helpful, and the building itself is well-maintained & clean. I appreciated that basic kitchen consumables (paper towels, detergent, starter pack of coffee, etc.) were provided, as were small shampoo, bath soaps, etc. This is a great location -- you can be in the park along the Charles River in 10 minutes -- plus many good places to eat & drink within a few blocks.  It is right in the middle of the action, so yes, a bit noisy, as it would be in any big city. I would stay here again."

A couple of things that a future guest should know: (1) the building backs onto the train tracks, so it's probably not a good stay for a light sleeper (although Chris provided a fan for white noise) and (2) there is currently no WiFi in the apartment, although Chris is remedying the situation in the immediate future."
6513924,40548331,2015-07-31,24277003,Ugur,Chris was a great host. He so kindly accomodated my late arrival due to a delayed flight. He was a welcoming host and his place was just what I needed. I highly recommend him.

6513924,41711415,2015-08-08,40652808,Mary Beth,"I cannot express enough how perfect this room was.  Not only was the host, Chris, extremely flexible about my last minute reservation, but he made it so very easy for me to get the keys and settle in.  The location is so easily accessible and there are a number of needed shops in the area."
The room was better than described; it is huge,bright,and perfectly suitable for a two day visit.  I was delighted by the trains passing by; if there is an issue with train noise,Chris has provided a number of noise canceling devices which also add an ambient feeling in the room.,,
I was able to come and go as I needed and I felt safe parking my car at his residence.,,,,,
Most importantly,Chris communicated regularly with me to make sure that my stay was everything that I had expected.,,,,
This reservation far exceeded my expectations.  Thanks,"Chris.\"",,,,
6513924,42485427,2015-08-13,38567719,Liam,"Chris was a fantastic host. Everything was 100% as described. He , was knowledgeable of the local area, approachable and even provided amenities such as earplugs, a face mask and a guide booklet. Chris went out of his way to pick me up from the local metro station when i arrived, and he even invited me to his local pub one evening to join him for a pub quiz. This was one of the first times I have used airbnb and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Boston is easily accessible from the location and the room is a good price for the quality. Thanks Chris."
6513924,42802959,2015-08-15,17918850,Nicholas,"Chris was very accommodating, he welcomed me at the door, showed me around the apartment and gave me recommendations about what to do in town. The apartment is at walking distance from the orange line that goes downtown. It's a really nice and clean apartment so I definitely recommended you stay at Chris' place !"
6513924,43563212,2015-08-20,39228051,Sebastian,"Chris is a friendly and caring guy who loves sports, just like myself, and who seemed quite busy working. That's why we did not really spend much time together. He was very helpful as far as recommendations for things to do and to see in Boston were concerned because he certainly knows the city and the area well. The room is alright but very close to the railway track. In case you're a light sleeper, better bring earplugs!"

The listing was very accurate: we got everything we expected, even more than we expected. The unit is very spacious and clean, within walking distance from T orange line.

The apartment was as described and not too far from the core of Boston (~45 min bus ride). At the price listed, I doubt there is a better catch in the Boston area. I would not hesitate to stay here again if I was visiting."

6513924,85749776,2016-07-13,82884890,Rachel,"I requested to stay with Chris last minute, and he accepted. It was only my second time using airbnb (the first time was just the night before), so I am new to the whole thing. Anyway, the room looks exactly as it did in the picture, and Chris was really nice. I only stayed one night as I had a long layover, but he was welcoming and made me feel comfortable, and I would definitely stay with him again! It was easy to get to his place because he lives right by the bus stop."
6513924,87449853,2016-07-20,26025737,Katherine,Chris was very welcoming! He was there to meet me and provided fresh sheets and bath towels. I was in town for work so I wasn't in the space too much but his home is clean and very worth the price. Would definitely stay again. The neighborhood made my commute to the city short and it was safe with easy parking.
6513924,87926311,2016-07-22,3063594,Subra,Excellent Airbnb and Chris was super friendly and loved the place and the neighborhood! I used to live in JP and was great be close to it

The only slightly negative element was that the shower wasn't super powerful, but it did the job and ultimately you're on a boat so what do you expect. I definitely recommend this place"

8596320,53819353,2015-11-13,4955573,Donald,"I thought this was a great apartment and experience. Everything was clean and comfortable with extras available if I needed them. Lacey stayed in touch with me regarding finding the apartment, checking in and checking out. The location worked really well as I could walk from the Broadway T station about 10-15 minutes and 10-12 minutes from the Convention Center. It was a quite neighborhood that worked well for me."
8596320,54517556,2015-11-21,30835769,Betul,"Lacey was a great host and helped a lot. The house was exactly like a 5 star hotel, it was very clean and the neighbor was very convenient for me since I attended a meeting nearby World Trade Center. On the other hand it is very close to the Broadway stop in red line metro."
8596320,55683193,2015-12-04,25489668,Jesse,"Had a great stay at Lacey's place. Although I did not get to meet her, her home was warm and welcoming and had everything I needed."
I was in town for a business conference at the convention center and walked there from her place every day.  The convention is super close (10-15 minute walk). It would be even closer but the convention center is so large that a good part of the walk is just getting to the entrance.,,,,,
"Great little neighborhood. About a 15 walk to the subway but there are plenty of restaurants and stores right up the block. Seaport district was really close.  Took the subway into the city a few nights and it was super close. My favorite part was the super comfy king bed!\"",,,,,
8596320,63751933,2016-02-26,3414520,Rachel,Lacey's place was amazing!!! Even nicer than the pictures!  The place was immaculate and the bed was very comfy. I stayed here for about a week for an event at the convention center.  It was a short 10-15 min walk.  I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it.
8596320,65036416,2016-03-10,13426705,Ramona,"Lacey was on vacation while I stayed at her home. Her instructions to her place and to get in were clear and it was all easy. After flying across the country to get there it was such a relief when I opened the door. Her home is immaculate! The bedroom is large, clean and comfortable. The bathroom had a good sized shower and large counter for all my essentials. It is beautifully decorated and comfortable.  She left a booklet of information as well as pamphlets with local information. I picked her place because it was close to the Convention Centre where I was attending a trade show. It was less than a 10 min walk away! While most the other attendees were waiting for their shuttle buses and fighting for cabs, I was already 'home' relaxing. A couple streets away is a lively area of restaurants, pubs and some shopping. A quick, inexpensive cab ride takes you into downtown. I recommend Lacey's place for any adventure in Boston but especially if you are attending an event at the Convention Centre! I have no complaints!"

We were very comfortable & there were great restaurants within walking distance. Host left a tour guide on the counter that was also very helpful. Parking is the biggest downside, but that goes for ALL of Boston. If you can avoid having a car with you, I would."

The loft was spacious. It was perfect for 3 people (a couple and a single) as there were 2 beds (A queen and a full).,,,,,

Minor communicated promptly, answering email questions and left a very comprehensive note about the house and the area.   Checking in and out was easy and we appreciated the welcoming provisions that included orange juice, milk, coffee and tea.  Additionally, the air conditioner helped to keep the loft at a comfortable temperature during the one hot day of our visit.  The only difficulty we had was that the skylights in the loft create a lot of light and we are used to a darker room for sleeping.  Otherwise, though, we found the environment very warm, comfortable and inviting."

And with the hiccups now resolved, it should be smooth sailing for your visit :-)"
The pictures aren't deceiving,this place is truly a gem. Further,the location is perfect for exploring Boston (a block from the MGH stop so taking public transportation from the airport is a breeze) and a short walk to the Commons and Public Garden and the start of the Freedom Trail!,,,
The kitchen has ample appliances to cook meals and Charles St has a lot of great restaurants worth exploring (be sure to get pizza at Fig and pastries at Tatte).

He provided detailed check-in instructions which included not only specifics about the apartment, but also great tips on enjoying the neighborhood restaurants.  The location was an absolutely perfect base for me and my two daughters to explore Boston.  Just steps from the front door you can find pastries, pizza, ice cream, coffee, and retail shops galore!  The street is so darling, it was tempting to linger, but there are so many other sights and neighborhoods to explore that we managed to peel ourselves away.  Hope to get to book this spot again!!  Thank you Jason!"
6326257,36798321,2015-07-01,29890279,Bernard,The host provided all of the information required to use the apartment. The listing is accurate. Handy combination locks mean no hassle with keys and need to have multiple keys for multiple guests.

Once we arrived, he texted me when I was still at the airport to let me know that there may have been some confusion with the bedding and to let him know. There was, in fact, one set of sheets missing for the blow up bed and he arrived in literally 5 minutes to give us the extra set. Additionally, he sent us restaurant recommendations and the ones we tried, were spot on."

6326257,53494599,2015-11-09,44836522,Leah,"Jason was prompt and extremely helpful from the very beginning.  He did not hesitate to speak with me in depth over the phone prior to our stay so that I could feel comfortable (as this was my first airbnb experience).  He made an exception and let us stay only 2 nights instead of the 3 night minimum, which was so kind of him since we were having trouble finding economical centrally located hotels with adjoining parlors or rooms to share as a family.  Jason even went above and beyond with a list of recommended places to eat and see during our stay in Boston, which made planning a breeze.  The apartment is beautifully decorated with a lot of attention to detail, which makes you feel at home.  Beacon Hill was such a charming neighborhood and we enjoyed walking through the character filled streets with our family.  The apartment is in such a great location to make the most of this walkable city!"

This apartment is just like the pictures - impeccably decorated and the right balance of sophistication and comfort.  The bedrooms are spacious with ample closet space and everything has been tastefully and recently renovated.  We typically stay in St Regis / Ritz Carlton type accommodations and were very happy here.  Jason is a fantastic host.  He takes care of every need and is SUPER responsive.  Finally, another word on the neighborhood...we explored all of Boston and it's clear this is one of the most posh, trendy, and charming neighborhoods.  Proximity to great dining spots, Boston Common, the waterfront, and shopping can't be beat!!"

Jason responded to every email prior to our trip quickly and also got in touch with me the day of our arrival to give me some advice on attending the 4th of July festivities in Boston.

With the bus stop literally across the street and only 10 minutes to the convention center/seaport biz district and 15 minutes to South Street Station and most key subway lines, the location could not be better situated in getting around easily and quickly. I especially loved going home to a nice neighborhood vs a basic hotel room. South Boston area was safe to walk around in at night and also a great walk to Castle Island and Fort Independence if you have some downtime. When back in Boston will check in with Monique first!"

They were up for hanging out in a laid-back way when I felt social and also respected my privacy when I needed to work.  They have an adorable and fun little girl, but at the same time, kept their home very clean.  Their neighborhood is quiet, and I slept great.

The room is small but nicely furnished and the apartment (especially the bathroom) was always very clean.

I came for a conference, and the BCEC was only a 30 minute walk away (6 mins by Uber!) so it was really convenient for me. The room is much bigger than the pictures demonstrate, the house is beautiful and they provided me with everything I needed. They were very generous with breakfast and coffee!"
2843596,29831728,2015-04-13,28094993,Kimberly,"Monique and her family were wonderful hosts!  They were welcoming, warmly inviting me into their home.  The room and bathroom was comfortable and clean.  As a first time Airbnb-er, it was a wonderful experience.  I attended a conference at the BCEC and it was about a 30 min walk or easy bus ride.  I didn't have a lot of extra time, but they offered both hospitality and lovely conversation.  Thank you!"
2843596,30203572,2015-04-19,3458056,Zacc,"Monique and Atilla were incredible hosts, and the place was PERFECT for my needs. I was in Boston to work at a conference in the BCEC, and was working very long days while there. The apartment was a 20 minute walk away from the convention center, and gave me a nice respite from all the hard work I was doing. The bed was comfortable, the space was cozy and warm, and Monique and Atilla were very inviting and generous. My only regret is that I didn't have time to get to know them better!"
2843596,30468802,2015-04-22,29933150,Leandro,Monique es una persona muy predispuesta y que en todo momento se preocupa por uno. Esta todo impecable y la cama es muy comoda.

2843596,32619751,2015-05-19,8219840,Fiona,Staying with Monique was perfect for my needs. She is very inviting and friendly and the accommodations were wonderfully clean and comfortable. She had coffee and breakfast items available and the necessary great wifi! The only challenge is finding a parking spot but she helped me find a place where I wouldn't get a ticket. I'm very grateful and pleased I stayed in her home for my Boston trip.
2843596,32635441,2015-05-19,7633121,Ken,"They were both incredibly gracious hosts, and would definitely reccommend them for a stay in South Boston. Only a mile from South Station and easy commute via all public transit. Thank you again. KEN"
2843596,33204762,2015-05-25,23304010,David,"This was a perfect booking for me.  I came in from out of town for some Memorial Day activities with a non-profit I am on the Board for.  I won't go into how much local hotels in the Boston area were going for- needless to say, this was a lot less.  The room is not big, but was absolutely clean and worked great for my needs.  I was gone most of the time, but it was great to walk a few blocks and be at the beach.  There is a nice restaurant Local 149 around the corner along with a few coffee places and corner stores.  I would definitely recommend staying here."

The room is exactly as described,small but cozy,the right amount of space for one person. The linens were fresh and clean and the bed/pillows were very comfortable. Since the weather was a little chilly,they provided a small heater for my room. They allowed me the usage of their coffe maker and provided fruit and other snacks.,,
The locations of the house is convenient,a couple of blocks from the beach and 15 min walk from the BCEC. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. Also,there are a few buses right across the street that you can catch to reach the subway and/or downtown area.,,,
I will definitely go back when I revisit Boston.,,,,,

I got in touch with Monique and she was still fine with someone checking in that late and even helpful after I showed up, offering navigation and dining tips. The room was fine, it's not a condo and the living space is intertwined with theirs so it's not the most suitable for a long term stay but the description is open about this. I really enjoyed it and am grateful for their kindness."
2843596,35234733,2015-06-16,33176901,Brinerdine,"My stay with Monique and her family was great. It felt like home away from home. The location was perfect, very accessible to public transport and interesting parks."

Did not hear airplanes although in very busy corridor (it was very. very quiet). No car parking. Took a chance on park parking and got no tickets. Proposed parking was way too far. I was offered coffee, tea and breakfast. Couldn't oblige...got up early and left for business reasons."
I have severe allergies to cats. (did not expect cats in the house.) No reaction whatsoever,probably because it was so clean!...;-)),,,,
All in all,looking for same address next time I am in the area because of convenience for my business needs,great location,awesome people,"really clean and great sleep.\"",

The bathroom is shared with another rented room, but it was never an issue. The neighborhood seems very safe and is on bus line to the major parts of Boston. Pleasure Cove beach and a bagel shop are only a couple of blocks away :) I loved my stay! If I go back I would definitely do it again."

2843596,41551425,2015-08-07,19510673,Barbara,"Monique and her husband Attilla were very gracious. The room was spotlessly clean. They gave access to cereal,milk, fruit and coffee for breakfast. I sat on the back porch in the sunshine to eat. It was an easy 1.6 mile walk to the Convention Center. The neighborhood was safe and attractive."
2843596,43170789,2015-08-17,41048165,Rose,"Monique and her husband were so welcoming - it was a great first experience with Airbnb.  The neighborhood was cute, Monique was very helpful with anything I needed and I was so glad I got to see a piece of Boston that a hotel can't offer."
2843596,45002123,2015-08-30,31903903,Prisca,"I very much enjoyed my stay with Monique, her husband, and daughter. In addition to being easy to talk to and very neat, they were generous with everything they had, from the kitchen to the laundry room. Their welcoming attitude gave their place a very home-like feeling. Public transportation by bus is less than 2 blocks away, making the more urban part of Boston very accessible. The neighborhood of South Boston is also pretty quiet and safe, with a fair share of convenience stores and food places a few blocks from Monique's house. Overall, I would highly recommend choosing Monique's home if you're looking for a peaceful place to stay with some family-like company."
2843596,45687713,2015-09-05,4491477,Cory,"Monique and her husband were the perfect hosts with a great place. The beauty of their apartment is the details that not all Airbnb hosts focus on - the place was incredibly clean, the bathroom was perfect with an awesome shower head, the Internet was fast, the sheets were super comfy. The location was perfect for me to get to the office and is great for access to the BCEC and seaport. The place was great and I'd love to stay there again."

2843596,51349855,2015-10-19,15862932,Karen,I was really happy to find a place in Boston in my budget. I did find that for a tourist being in South Boston was a little hard without a car. I spent time figuring out transportation and doing a lot of walking. I also used Uber so that was a little extra added cost but it helped with time. I enjoyed staying with the Medina family they kept to themselves in the evening when I was there but we did enjoy breakfast together and they gave me some Ideas on Transportation to some of the places I was interested in seeing. I did enjoy getting to know the People of South Boston it is a old Irish neighborhood and I had dinner at a local pub it was fun to get to chat with some of the old family's they are very protective of their neighborhood it was fun to chat with locals.
2843596,51800970,2015-10-24,13746621,Susanne,"Monique's place is a really good place to stay for exploring Boston. Although one should be aware that it is located in South Boston, which means one should take a bus (close and easy) to arrive the downtown attractions. I recomment renting the cool yellow bike (or get it for free if you stay for 3 or more nights)!! The room is small, but clean and ok for sleeping. Monique and her family have been really nice and helpful with maps, tips (liked having a draft beer at Local 149 on P Street) and tea / coffee / cereals / fruits. I've had a really good time staying and chatting with Monique and her husband!"
2843596,52561528,2015-10-30,14862415,Susan,great and cozy space to live in.

It's a small, practical, clean and comfortable room. A simple phone call to Top Cab brought a cab in 15 minutes when I did need a cab, otherwise I walked, but I know the bus was very nearby too. I'd stay here again."

They were warm and around for a chat and at the same time happy for me just to do my own thing in my own space. I was in Boston for a conference and it was a great location to have a nice morning walk to the conference center or with the bicycle a very quick ride to get there.
2843596,70456481,2016-04-17,34930815,Gladys,Monique & her family were accommodating  & easy going. I loved the location. South Boston is Boston without the tourist chaos. Town houses are incredible! Beautiful walk to the ocean & close to local restaurants. Uber into the city was $4-6. I also parked my car at Channel Center Garage for my whole stay at a decent price. You can reserve a spot through Parking Panda which is cheaper or just show up. Resident permit is required to park on the street. It does get noisy in the morning & would not book if you plan to sleep in. I didn't mind the noise since I'm use to it. I recommend eating at The Galley Diner. It's a short walk & has good breakfast. I ordered my breakfast bagel to go & ate at the beach. I would stay here again.
2843596,71283420,2016-04-24,49350548,Corey,Monique and her husband Atilla went above and beyond to make sure my stay was a great time. They provided more than they needed to for me to have a satisfactory stay including use of their spare bicycle to get to the convention I was going to at the BCEC even more conveniently than had I taken my car.
2843596,74429550,2016-05-15,5101018,Brenda,"Monique and her husband were very welcoming.  The room is exactly as pictured and it was quite clean.  The neighborhood was sweet and the beach is a short walk.  The only thing wrong with this location is that there is no parking!!  Almost all street parking requires a resident sticker and there are a very few two hour visitor spots.  If you are driving, I don't recommend this location."

Once I arrived we chatted a bit and she showed me my room and the shared spaces. Everything was perfect and as pictured. After talking for a bit Monique gave me some great suggestions for dining that night. She also offered to take me to my race early the next morning at 6am, because public transportation would be tricky. In the morning I was greeted and offered breakfast, then taken to my race by her husband. By far some of the nicest people I've encountered!"
2843596,78283557,2016-06-06,24034703,Filomíla Melína,"My stay with Attila's and Monique's family was excellent. A very welcoming family, with whom I would be happy, and in fact look forward, to stay again. The room is as pictured and the accommodation exactly as reported in Monique's detailed description. The location suited me perfectly for the World Trade Centre (and the Convention and Exhibition Centre) - a 10 minute leisure ride on the rustic bike! Neighbourhood felt safe. Some amenities close by (especially a little pizza place for great take-aways!). Overall, a lovely  experience, quite true to the AirBnb vision - a home away from home!"
2843596,81060706,2016-06-20,6684044,Muriel,Accueil très chaleureux de la part de Monique et de son mari qui sont vraiment adorables et qui ont fait le maximum pour que je me sente comme chez moi. J'ai beaucoup apprécié la salle de bains privée et l'accès à la cuisine quand je voulais ainsi que la propreté de tout l'appartement qui était irréprochable. Le vélo est aussi un plus et très pratique pour aller au centre de conférences ou à une station de métro. La proximité de la plage est très agréable. Les enfants sont très discrets et pas gênants du tout. Chambre à recommander sans problème.
2843596,81665036,2016-06-24,79242176,Collin,Very welcoming and very friendly. Great location comparison to Boston. They went above and beyond to make sure that is was a good experience. They cost for staying there was very nice for the convince and hopitality.

Everything was exactly as described:  The house is located in a friendly part of South Boston a short bus ride from downtown, and everything was clean and in order with the room.

It was very convenient - steps away from the T and within a blocks of some really great restaurants and shops. The bed was comfy and they included everything that we possibly could have needed, from an extra fan to kitchen utensils. Mary Kate and Javier themselves were super sweet, meeting me at the apartment and showing me where everything was, answering my numerous questions, and offering suggestions of where to go near by. They even had bottles of water, coffee, and tea ready for us. Next time I'm back in Boston, I will definitely try to stay at their place again! Thanks for everything!"

1704090,11658090,2014-04-11,10673010,Sarah,"It was a pleasure working with Mary Kate.  She was very responsive and accommodating, even with our unusual booking - I wasn't staying at this apartment myself.  Instead, I reserved this apartment for an artist visiting Boston for an extended stay.  Mary Kate was kind enough to give me a tour in advance - it's a very cute garden-style studio apartment.  Very clean and well maintained.  I heard nothing but positive feedback from our visiting artist.  The location was a key factor for us - close to restaurants and grocery stores, and quick access to downtown.  I would absolutely recommend that you check out this location as an alternative to pricey downtown hotel rooms."
1704090,11861919,2014-04-17,6727530,Ahad,We spent 3 days in this lovely place. Mary personally welcomed us into the property and made us feel like we're at home. The place is very clean and also close to Train station (15 min train ride to downtown). Highly recommended.

Me and my boyfriend spent 4 nights in Mary Kate and Javier apartment which is a wonderful place where to stay: walking distance (2min) from the closest subway station and in a safe area.

1704090,12776085,2014-05-11,9926245,Alice,"This apartment is wonderful. Mary Kate was incredibly helpful, and very kind. The apartment is clean, warm and very nicely set up. I stayed for just over a week and so did a fair amount of my own cooking, and found the little kitchen very well appointed. The apartment is very close to the t-stop, so transport is easy, and the neighbourhood of Jamaica Plain is very cool - it was easily my favourite part of Boston. Highly recommended."
1704090,13061616,2014-05-19,6142647,Arnbjorn,"Awesome apartment and wonderful hosts. I'm a airbnb host myself, so I was pleasantly surprised to have an apartment more than meet my expectations. Best of all are the hosts though, Mary Kate and Javier. Lovely people. Genuinely lovely."
Corrsepondance was excellent,the place was clean and had everything we needed ... and then some. Fresh fruit,bread and plenty of bottled water. Brilliant.,,,
Oh and one more thing. The Samuel Adams microbrewery is just around the corner,with free tasting and tours every day. I just might have to come back :),,,,
"My very best recommendations for both the place and the people.\"",,,,,
1704090,13600335,2014-06-01,10949949,Ashley,"The apartment was extremely clean, and so welcoming. I rented it for my parents when they were in town for my college graduation, and it was perfect! We were able to use the stovetop to cook breakfast each morning. The apartment is seriously just steps away from both the T and Sam Adams brewery. Additionally, parking was super convenient. Mary Kate was a very responsive host. My parents were sad to leave the apartment!"
1704090,13845657,2014-06-06,13806687,Sara,"Mary Kate and Javier were really wonderful hosts. The studio was really cute with plenty of coffee and tea and milk (very important for us Brits!) and everything was clean. Communication was first class, we would highly recommend staying in their studio apartment as the location is superb. Couldn't have been better!!"
1704090,14853145,2014-06-28,2294895,Christina,"My parents were visiting and stayed at Mary Kate and Javier's place.  It was cozy but spacious, nicely appointed, and private.  My parents, being older, had a few 'needs' haha- AC and a blown fuse.  Javier came by twice to accommodate them with no trouble and quickly.  Mary Kate was patient and understanding and communicated really clearly.  They had a great stay and I highly recommend."

1704090,15630142,2014-07-13,8362449,Stephanie,Super clean and comfortable place to stay. Great location to the T and local shops. The space has a ton of character and is very well taken care of! Communication was easy and the overall space was delightful!
1704090,16291235,2014-07-25,11011938,Menno,"We had a great time at Mary Kate's and Javiers place. It was everything we expected it to be. Mary Kate didn't have a problem with us arriving a bit later and was quick to answer a few questions we had later on. Unfortunatly you could hear the person upstairs walking around and he or she wakes up at 6 am. But we didn't mind much, because we were jetlagged and wanted to get up early to explore the city anyway. Me and my girlfriend would definitely recommend staying here. Thank you Mary Kate and Javier."
1704090,16882393,2014-08-04,6780617,Hannah,"This is the absolute most perfect place to stay in Boston! Fun, quiet, cute, and convenient neighborhood. located so close to the T, there really is no reason for a car. Great Coffee shops and bakeries within a short walking distance, and a beautiful park less than a mile up the road to run or bike. The place itself was perfect as well, spacious studio apartment, with everything you might need. (even down to an umbrella in case of rain). Mary Kate was great to work with, nice, responsive and her attention to detail was obvious in the layout and furnishing of the space. She provided us with great recommendations for things to do and places to eat. All were excellent! I will definitely be checking in when I am back in Boston. Loved it!"
1704090,17505377,2014-08-13,6375719,Barb,"Mary Kate and Javier have made the apartment very comfortable.  The bedding was great, the towels thick and comfy.  They even left us fresh fruit and coffee.    The location is an easy walk to the T station, also a great coffee/sandwich shop just around the corner.    Our only problem related, not to the apartment, but the parking system in Boston.   Make sure you know which day is 'street cleaning' day, otherwise the City of Boston will tow your car away."
1704090,18296619,2014-08-25,11223517,Trevor,"Mary Kate and Javier made us feel most welcome. They helped us out when we got lost on arrival! Also able to accommodate our bags for leaving day, thank you. The apt was in a good location, very near the T line."
1704090,18895392,2014-09-02,80896,Luanna,"While we did not meet Mary Kate and Javier, we enjoyed staying at their apartment. The communication with Mary Kate was very good and the keys were waiting for us when we arrived. The apartment was perfect for our stay in Boston. Super close to the T and the Sam Adams Brewery!! We liked the clean confortable space along with the kitchen that we used and the coffee they provided☺ Our only disappointment of the trip which had nothing to do with Mary Kate or her space was our dinner at Bella Luna restaurant. It is within walking distance but the service was bad, the food mediocre and the prices high."
1704090,19410392,2014-09-12,11755766,Marina,"Minha estadia foi deliciosa! Como os comentários anteriores indicavam, o lugar é muito melhor do que aparenta nas fotos ( nas quais já parece excelente)."
Quando chegamos estava tudo extremamente organizado e limpo,muito cuidado com os detalhes!,,,,
Javier também teve toda a preocupação em nos visitar para ter certeza de que tudo estava saindo bem!,,,,,
A localização é excelente! O bairro é muito agradável e muito muito perto do metrô!,,,,,
O casal também nos ajudou muito com uma encomenda que recebemos antes do previsto o que fez toda diferença na viagem!,,,,,
Só tenho o que agradecer,"elogiar e recomendar!\"",,,,
1704090,19889100,2014-09-20,5657837,Suzanne,"Mary Kate and Javier were wonderful hosts. I have only positive things to say about their sweet studio apartment. The pictures accurately describe the place. For a studio it was slightly bigger than I expected. The sleigh bed is very comfortable as is the sofa. It was also very clean.  Nice roomy closet, good shower. We were very happy in that homey place. We also fell in love with the neighborhood. Their were plenty of nice cafe's and restaurants around and City Feed or something close to that name, just down the street, has the best croissants I've had since being in Paris!  The subway is very close and easy to get downtown from. We got to know so many interesting people, including the boys at a classic neighborhood barbershop, and they even cut my bangs! All in all a wonderful vacation. Thank you so much Mary Kate and Javier for all the wonderful little touches, it's always nice to get to a place and find a cabinet filled with essentials like olive oil, a few spices and salt and pepper. My favorite touch, however, was the charming antique window hanging over the kitchen sink, it was an unexpected little treasure."
1704090,20273054,2014-09-27,12220112,Patricia,"We found our way easily to the apartment and it is so well situated near the subway. Mary Kate greeted us and was so helpful, giving us really good advice about local shopping- especially because we needed to get some new suitcases for the journey home. Later in the week, we had really  good support from Mary Kate when we had a few more queries."
"\"",,,,,
1704090,21374436,2014-10-16,11483605,Emma,"Mary Kate gave us excellent directions to the apartment, and she even stayed to greet us, despite our flight being delayed. She was immediately welcoming and told us the essentials, including some great tips about the neighbourhood. The apartment suited our needs and was just like it is in the photos, and Mary Kate was kind enough to leave us fruit, water and coffee/tea. The only negatives we found were the lack of a toaster/grill - with us not being the kind to have cooked breakfasts every day, this left us with just cereal. You also hear a lot of noise from people walking around in the apartment above, and we noticed people using the washing machine at 11.30pm which is just outside the apartment's back door so you can hear it quite loudly!"
Jamaica Plains is a very quiet neighbourhood,and if I'm honest,perhaps a little too quiet for what we wanted. That being said we had one of our best meals on the holiday at Tres Gatos,a brilliant tapas bar (where you must order the tortilla!) which is about a 15 minute walk away,thanks again to Mary Kate for recommending it. Whole Foods and the main shops are a good 15-20 min walk,and there's City Feed
We had a great time in Boston,and Mary Kate and Javier's apartment served us well,"and is exactly as described. I'd definitely recommend it if you're after a quiet place away from the bustle of the city. \"",,,
1704090,22138754,2014-10-31,19260288,Adam,"Great place in a good area clean and well laid out. Very convenient to Transport and the city, and, unlike many other places in Boston, street parking was easy and plentiful. Thanks again!"
1704090,25951920,2015-01-31,16865645,Fabiana,"The apartment is really great and Mary Kate and Javier are excellent hosts. My husband and I stayed for two months and loved it! Javier even helped us a lot with the bags. The apartment is very close to the Stony Brook T station and within walking distance from shops and supermarket. It is a nice place to stay, even during a snow storm! The neighbors in the building are all very friendly. Everything was clean and welcoming, with lots of tea and coffee. The washing machine is convenient and easy to operate. The Sam Adams Brewery is just a few steps away from the apartment and it was an unexpected and delicious surprise for us! My husband and I highly recommend staying in this apartment."
1704090,26416184,2015-02-12,24702520,Isabelle,Nous avons été très bien reçu. Mary-Kate s'est libérée pour nous accueillir alors que nous sommes arrivés plus tôt que prévu. L'appartement correspond tout à fait aux photos. Il est situé près de la station de métro.
1704090,26827715,2015-02-20,1211417,Vered,"I had a lovely stay at Mary Kate and Javier's studio apartment. It was a cold and *very* snowy week in Boston and they made sure the path to the studio was shoveled and the heat was on when I arrived. They also accommodated my request to drop off my suitcase early in the morning, which made the logistics of my day much easier."
The bed was comfortable (though I could have used another blanket or two - it was a remarkably cold week!),apartment very clean,and kitchen easy to use. Only drawback was the upstairs neighbors,who were walking around and making a fair amount of noise after midnight the first two nights I was there (weeknights),which did affect my sleep. Mary Kate was quick and responsive to my questions,"though there was not much that could be done so late at night.\""
1704090,28713104,2015-03-29,24071005,Jeff,Mary Kate is awesome. Great place to stay. Very clean and welcoming. The towels smelled soooo good :). I'd stay here again in a second. Right next to the T train.
1704090,29726699,2015-04-12,4872368,Kari,"We very much enjoyed staying in Mary Kate and Javier's studio in JP.  The location was very quiet, safe, and convenient.  We were able to get to all of our planned activities within 20 minutes on the T, and even made it out to Salem for a day trip.  Shout out to Ula Cafe just a block or two away!  We stopped there for coffee a few times before hitting the town."
1704090,30437436,2015-04-22,197872,Jeff,"We did not meet Mary Kate or Javier, but Mary Kate was a great communicator through text and email and promptly answered any questions we had.  The studio apartment was great for our needs as it was very close to the metro.  We frequently walked to Whole Foods in Jamaica Plains for pre-marathon food and supplies.  The apartment was clean and the towels were awesome.  There are other tenants in the building and you will hear the tenants above you.  We would recommend this studio apartment!"
1704090,30899642,2015-04-28,30344434,Yolanda,"This was my first Airbnb experience. I had the most positive experience with Mary Kate and Javier. They were very hospitable and easily accessible if I had questions. Their place was just like the pictures...a charming, cozy studio apartment that had pretty much anything you might need (sugar, olive oil, tea, coffee, pancake mix, fresh linens, washer & dryer, laundry detergent, a candle, etc.) They respected privacy and didn't just enter the apartment especially when I wasn't there. The location was perfect. Probably a literal minute walk from the subway station (orange line). The best cafe ever (Ula Cafe) was probably a 5 minute walk. I will definitely stay there on my next visit and recommend anyone that is looking for a place to stay while in Boston stay at this location!"
1704090,31701461,2015-05-09,18572502,Guoying,"The pics are exactly the same as the actual looks. Mary Kate left a greeting note on the bed side for things that we need to notice, that's really nice of her. I met Mary Kate once while I come to see how's thing going on with my mother and grandma, they really like the room, design and the backyard. And it's easy to find."
1704090,32457219,2015-05-18,7180929,Asher,"Mary Kate and Javier were very communicative from the start, which helped me coordinate well between us and my parents. The apartment was clean and had a really cute setup. My parents enjoyed the bed and couch and watched a bit of the tv for local news. The location was also amazing, just 2 blocks from the T and around the corner from the Brewery."
The downsides to the stay for my parents was the tiny bathroom. My parents are in their 60s and were nervous about falling without a grab bar. They also had a bit of trouble with the toilet pressure being low and there was no plunger. Mary Kate was available,though,so I'm sure it would have worked out had there been a bigger issue.,,,
Ultimately,"I thought it was a cute place. I'd recommend it to people who are more agile than my parents.\"",,,,
1704090,34196327,2015-06-06,28832265,Jason,"The space was clean and as described.  The unit has everything you would need and is quiet. Location is within a block of the train station, making it very convenient."
1704090,36507873,2015-06-29,7957953,Edee,We loved the time we spent in JP. Everything was within walking distance. The apartment was very quiet which we appreciated. Plenty of essentials especially coffee was available to us. Mary Kate met us as planned and was very sweet. We met Javier later in the week and he was equally nice
1704090,37457387,2015-07-07,31442042,Rebecca,"Staying at Mary Kate and Javier's home was an Airbnb first for both my boyfriend and I, and for sure it won't be our last! Mary Kate was extremely responsive to all of my emails and texts while I was planning our trip to the Boston area. The home is quiet, comfortable, welcoming, and clean. Since it is conveniently located within walking distance to the train, we were able to park our vehicle on the street and rely primarily on public transportation which was perfect for us! The kitchen was complete and had everything we needed to cook some great meals during our week visit! There were many small touches throughout the apartment like towels, washing detergent, coffee, seasonings, umbrellas, etc which made our stay feel extra homey! We are thankful that our stay was such a great one!"
1704090,38494616,2015-07-16,26432859,Massimo,"Quartiere comodissimo con metro vicinissima, i padroni di casa non li abbiamo mai visti ad accoglierci c'era il figlio quindi era come se fossimo a  casa nostra...l'appartamento forse andrebbe un po ristrutturato ma accogliente peccato qualche insetto"
1704090,41602688,2015-08-08,22294758,Rich,"Mary Kate and Javier are both great hosts, and although we didn't get a chance to meet them in person, Mary Kate & I became texting buddies, and we ended up becoming good friends through our week there. We met several people who lived there, whom were neither Mary Kate nor Javier, but we found out later that Javier was the person working on our yard during one of the mornings there!"
Mary Kate left a note for us with some great restaurants,"and we tried \"\"Tres Gatos\"\" our first night there",which was a delight. There is a full kitchen there,and we loved the full size refrigerator. The A/C works great,especially since we were there through a fairly hot week of August. The bed was extremely comfortable,and the bathroom had great hot water. The comfortable couch faces a television with multiple channels. There is a locked door which opens up to a washer & dryer that costs $1.25 per each load. The Train station is less than a block away (Orange Line Stonybrook). Overall
"What is great is that the Samuel Adams brewery is just a block away. Some other great restaurants that are close by are \"\"Ula\"\" and \"\"Chilacates\"\". There are so many great colleges & universities",that we saw Harvard,MIT,and Boston University all within a few days. We went by Fenway Park,the JFK presidential library and museum,and the EMK Senate Institute. These are just some of the things that we enjoyed
1704090,43610957,2015-08-21,2583666,Amy,"Grazie per l'accoglienza! Abbiamo trovato il posto subito e vicino la stazione, proprio a pochi passi. L'appartamento era pulito ed in ordine e con tutte le cose necessarie per cucinare. All angolo si trova un negozietto con tutto il necessario. Il posto è molto tranquillo e si trovano bei posticini per mangiare sia per colazione sia per cena. Raccomando il posto pienamente...! Grazie!"
1704090,44783222,2015-08-29,37788139,Jennifer,"I was in Boston for a week-long training, so I just needed a place to crash that was affordable and convenient. This place fit my needs perfectly."
I didn't get to meet Mary Kate and Javier,but they ensured that my check-in/out process was smooth and checked up on me via text a few times to make sure I had everything I needed.,,,,
That being said,there are some pros/cons that I would like to list out just so people are aware of what to expect.,,,,
Pros:,,,,,
-Free off-street parking,,,,,
-1 block from T-stop,,,,,
-Clean,adorable apartment with nice furnishings and decorations - very cozy.,,,,
-Kitchen comes with pots,pans,plates,utensils and other basic cooking supplies - very convenient for me as I did some cooking while there.,,
-Clean linens and towels provided,,,,,
-Free wifi,,,,,
-Coin-op laundry in building,,,,,
-Couple of cute cafes in walking distance + Whole Foods a 1/2 mile away,,,,,
-Adorable outdoor patio area,,,,,
Cons: (none of these relate to the host in any way,but just a couple things people should be aware of who are looking at this property),,,,
-Jamaica Plain is a transitioning neighborhood - there are some sketchy areas. This location was on the borderline of that,it didn't bother me,but for others it might not feel as safe.,,,
-This is a basement apartment so I did see a fair share of spiders during my stay,,,,,
-There is a random step-down into the living room,I checked in at night and nearly fell down tripping over the step.,,,,
-The bathroom also has a random step-up into it,and I nearly fell down going to the bathroom during the night. I ended up keeping the bathroom light on during my stay so I wouldn't trip and fall.,,,,
-The floors are a little thin. I was woken up in the middle of the night by the upstairs neighbors walking around - I wore earplugs the rest of the trip and was fine.,,,,,
Like I said,overall my experience was incredibly positive and the pros outweighed the cons for me. I'd definitely stay here again. Thank you Mary Kate and Javier!,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1704090,45550107,2015-09-04,26577367,Michelle,Had frequent contact with Mary Kate and Javier leading up to the holiday which was excellent. Met Javier at the apartment promptly and he gave us a quick tour of the place and left his contact number should we have needed to contact them.
The apartment was spacious,clean and in a perfect location (less than 5 mins from a T stop into the city). It had a good wifi connection,clean towels,"a very comfortable bed and a nice clean bathroom as well as good air conditioning (as it was quite a humid time we were there). Definitely a gem of an apartment and we would love to stay again in the near future. Mary Kate and Havier were lovely owners and couldn't have done more!\"",,
1704090,51264864,2015-10-19,18592892,Angus,The accommodation was exactly as advertised and met our requirements.
The premises met a high standard of cleanliness and was comfortable.  Fresh flowers and a gift card for a local cafe added to the air of welcome.,,,,,
On the down side,the pathway to the door was muddy (after rain) and paving would have been an advantage.  One window has clear glass but no blind to give privacy.  While we were never challenged in any way,"people hung around in doorways in the area at all hours and it was less tidy than one might expect.\"",,,
1704090,52056813,2015-10-26,27963606,Stuart,"Mary Kate and Javier were very accessible and accommodating hosts even though we never actually met.  Booking went smoothly.  The key was left where we could easily find it.  When we called with a concern about a damp smell, Javier set up the dehumidifier that afternoon, which helped.  The large one room is very attractive and clean with separate entrance, sleeping, sofa and tv, and kitchen areas.  The bed is very comfortable.  The kitchen has a large fridge and is well equipped.  A couple of things are quirky.  The floor is wavy in places, the step up to the bathroom is hard to see at night, and the steps down from the doorway are of uneven heights.  Maybe not for everybody but spacious, clean, well appointed, comfortable and convenient.  Nice neighborhood, great location near T stop that goes direct to downtown, close to the excellent restaurants at the Sam Adams brewery, and walking distance to Center St shopping / restaurants and Franklin Park and Zoo.  We parked on-street close by for several nights without a problem, but be mindful of the need to move on Tues noon-4 or be towed by the street cleaners."
1704090,52739412,2015-11-01,1263657,Paola & Rossana,"We found the Place very easily as is it just next the underground stop. The house is clean, confortable and very well equipped, with the main stuff complete! Javier waited for us at home and gave us usefull informations, how to move around where buy food ect. He is a very friendly person and ready to offer us any help ! Tks Javier :-)"
1704090,54369261,2015-11-19,1695789,Wendy,"The accommodations were just as the hosts presented in their Airbnb description. They were attractive, comfortable, extremely clean, and a great place in which to stay. The hosts were welcoming, very available and responsive to any questions, and were also very respecting of our personal space and were completely unobtrusive.  The residence is a few steps from the MTA station with its access to all parts of Boston, and the neighborhood is delightful with access to all sorts of wonderful shops and restaurants."
1704090,55487702,2015-12-01,22376800,Zaharadeen,We had a truly amazing stay at Mary Kate and Javier's place. Good sized apartment fully stocked with well functioning appliances and everything you need for that homely feeling. It is located in a fine neighborhood close to the subway station for easy and convenient access to downtown. The hosts were fantastic; Mary Kate was an absolute professional. Check-in and check-out went smoothly. Great experience and highly recommended for anyone visiting the city looking for accommodation.
1704090,62566939,2016-02-15,4623030,Jon,"Our stay had some ups and downs, but it turned out positive in the end."
We arrived fairly late on our check-in day and Javier suggested some nearby restaurants we could order take out from. Also,despite being literally across the street from the orange line we took in,he picked us up and showed us the apartment and was very friendly.,,,
The unit was as advertised. Not fancy,but a good amount of space and a comfortable bed. The shower was small,but water pressure and heat were perfectly good. The wifi worked fine for basic browsing and Netflix.,,,
The trouble occurred when on our second night the weather got down to -5ºF. The thermostat was set to 80ºF,but the heat just couldn't do the job and we woke to the temperature reading 59ºF. I texted Javier at 9:30am and he responded promptly,offering to bring a space heater and at 12:30. I also contacted Airbnb to let them know what was going on.,,,
Javier dropped off the heater and blanket while we were out and together with rising ambient temperatures,the apartment returned to comfortable temperatures. However,"I was disappointed that for several hours we did not enjoy the advertised amenity of \"\"heat\"\". I had a discussion with Javier where I requested a partial refund to compensate for the discomfort",but we couldn't come to an agreement and he suggested I take it up with Airbnb.,,
In the end Airbnb refunded me $50,"which satisfied me. The rest of our stay was uneventful.\"",,,,
1704090,64829894,2016-03-08,12937535,Heidi,"The space was perfect for my stay, and Mary Kate made it all very easy!"
1704090,65354032,2016-03-13,57193642,Joyse,"As soon as we were close, Mary-Kate and Javier texted us that they had saved a spot in front for our car (which was so sweet bc parking was a little tricky).  Javier greeted us and told us some activities to do around the area, and showed us where the T station was (literally right down the street)."
Walking in,the apartment is spacious,open and cute!  There was a baguette on the table (which was so thoughtful because we had a 4hr drive),fresh flowers,coffee/tea,towels
The TV was not working.. it did not affect us in any way because the Wi-Fi allowed us to Netflix.  When I told them,Javier was immediately offering to come over to check it out and possibly fix it.  Since there was something wrong with the outlet,they offered us a partial refund,which we had not asked for but were very happy with!,,
Overall,it was a very pleasant stay and we would love to come back to visit Boston and explore the Jamaica Plain area further!  Mary-Kate and Javier were great hosts,"and the apartment is great.\"",,,
1704090,66979036,2016-03-26,7957953,Edee,They were very kind and helpful.
The brought extra items we needed quickly.,,,,,
"Loved the JP experience \"",,,,,
1704090,68363293,2016-04-04,6304159,Richard,"We really loved staying at Mary Kate and Javier's apartment. It was a really great experience (and easy!) from start to finish. Javier was there to greet us and we had absolutely no problems. The place was spotless, spacious and in a really cute neighbourhood. We would definitely come back here. (They think of everything too--we appreciated using their nice umbrellas that don't fall apart in the Bostonian wind)."
1704090,70736550,2016-04-20,42873398,Halie,"Everything about our stay was perfect. The space is ideal for 2 people, very clean and nice accommodations. It is conveniently located near the orange line of the subway, so as long as you feel comfortable using public transportation there is no need for a vehicle. Mary Kate and Javier were both at the house to greet us, and incredibly hospitable throughout our stay. We would definitely stay with them again if we return to Boston. Thanks again!"
1704090,71509162,2016-04-25,43226724,Erica,"Kate and Javier were attentive hosts and responsive to questions before and during our stay. The place was as they described, clean and worked very well for two of us spending a long weekend in the city. The fresh flowers were an added bonus!"
1704090,72612600,2016-05-03,31732578,Stefanie,"Lovely stay at Mary Kate and Javier's place. They were very accommodating and easy to communicate with. Unit was very clean, private, quiet, very close to the Stony Brook T stop. Would recommend to anyone!"
1704090,76105344,2016-05-24,40392198,Rainer,"We had a great stay at Mary-Kate and Javier's place in Stony Brook. The place was exactly as advertised. There was some milk, eggs, water & coffee in the refrigerator (Thanks!). The place was clean, with sufficient towels & great linen on the bed. The bed is absolutely divine! Everything worked, the heater, washer & dryer. The place is absolute value for money. We met Javier on the first day and he was very friendly. Mary-Kate responded very quickly to our questions on how does this or that work. The outside area is great for morning coffees and just generally sitting there. We spent 18 days there and absolutely loved it!! Thanks to Mary-Kate & Javier."
1704090,76619345,2016-05-28,57203735,Nik,Me and my wife came out to Boston for some vacation and we booked Mary Kate and Javier's place a few months in advance which I recommend because it will go fast. Mary Kate and Javier were amazing hosts. They accommodated to our every need. Our flight even arrived a lot earlier than our check in time was but they allowed us to drop off our luggage at the apt earlier while it was being cleaned so we didn't have to haul it all over town with us.  The best part of their place is the fact that is is super close to the T station so it made traveling super easy. I only have one word of caution. If you are tall then watch your head walking into the apt. I hit my head on a beam a couple of times the first time we got there but other than that you have everything you need. We will most definitely use Mary Kate and Javier again for air bnb next time we are in Boston.
1704090,77675560,2016-06-02,18036561,Maria,Die Unterkunft war wie beschrieben.Mary-Kate hat uns zwar nicht persönlich empfangen aber das Kommunizieren über Telefon hat gut geklappt.Toll ist die Nähe zur Straßenbahn.Zur Innenstadt ist es nicht weit.
"Das Apartment ist groß und gemütlich.Leider ist das Apartment etwas hellhörig aber ansonsten ruhig. Die Austattung war gut.Insgesamt hat es uns gut gefallen.\"",,,,,
1704090,77898108,2016-06-04,1663442,Ana Fernanda,"Perfect stay in a perfect place!!! Highly recommended, comfortable house, nice host, great location."
1704090,80337616,2016-06-17,744914,Nikki,"I didn't meet them, but Mary Kate and Javier were very easy to communicate with. Their place is roomy yet cosy, and super-convenient to the orange line. It's also just a block away from the Sam Adams Brewery, where they give informative and yet fun tours with lots of free beer. Jamaica Plain is a fun, funky neighborhood with a balanced mix of parks, urban shopping, great restaurants, and lively nightlife. I would stay here again!"
1704090,81050624,2016-06-20,17713550,Gabrielle,"The studio (which is more of an appartment considering the size) was everything that was promised, very conveniently placed (3 minute walk to the subway - the station is Stony Brook /orange line), exhaustively furnished, well air conditioned etc."
The neighborhood is very quiet and you can find little delis nearby for basic groceries (the whole foods is more accessible by car than by foot though).,,,,,
This is a basement appartment so mostly lit by artificial light but considering the comfort it provided and the crazy expensive average prices of hotels and bnbs in Boston,this is one of the best value for money studio available.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1704090,82670396,2016-06-28,19262445,Mary,"We found this place reasonable and located close to the T. This cozy basement studio apartment was clean and perfect for our work-cation. On Sunday nights, be very aware of the street parking, the signs are further up on the street and we missed one of the many restrictive signs and our car was towed."
1704090,84282528,2016-07-06,7498274,Jillian,"Hosts were great. Very helpful upon my arrival. The space was actually cuter than I thought it'd be. Very modern with all the amenities I needed. The bed was comfortable, kitchen was equipped, there is a nice closet to hang clothes in -- bathroom & shower are a bit small and it was a little damp/musty for being a basement unit (though it also helps keep it cool, which is also nice). I loved the decor and book shelves."
1704090,85899368,2016-07-13,17738636,Andrea,"Mary Kate and Javier made staying at their perfectly located studio a breeze. We had easy access the minute we arrived. When we couldn't get the TV to work, Javier was there almost immediately with the cable guy to fix it. The studio is quite spacious with fantastic towels, bedding and mattress and was very comfortable regardless of the temperature being in the 60s or the 90s. It's location is also perfect, just steps away from the Stony Brook T and easy walking distance to many cafes. Of the three places we've stayed at in JP over the past year, we'd definitely stay there again!"
1704090,89244428,2016-07-27,25888047,Nathalie,"A notre arrivée, Javier est venu pour voir si tout allait bien. Il nous a donné les codes wifi et s’est assuré que nous arrivions à nous connecter , il nous a aussi expliquer comment aller au Whole Foods à pied ce qui nous a été très utile. Le studio est spacieux, très confortable et très bien équipé. Tout y est pour se sentir comme à la maison. Il ne manque rien.  L'appartement étant en sous-sol, l'utilisation de la lumière artificielle était souvent nécessaire mais on s’y habitue très vite et nous avons pu profiter du patio en toute tranquillité, ce qui était fort appréciable. Si vous êtes matinal, vous pourrez faire connaissance avec les écureuils. Le voisinage est calme et agréable. La station de métro (Stony Brook sur la ligne orange) est très proche et il y a un parc juste en face. Nous avons beaucoup aimé notre séjour à Jamaica Plain."
11592067,65137887,2016-03-11,62154174,Matthew,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.

1956275,9905567,2014-01-18,9252614,Scott,Lovely property - quiet and well maintained. Emmanuell was pleasant and very helpful.
1956275,9964803,2014-01-21,11062873,Summer Daye,"Emmanuel was an excellent host. The house is lovely. It was perfect place for our family to use to visit the Boston area. The beds are comfortable, the neighborhood was very safe. I was happy to share the information with my family in Boston so other friends I and family can use a familiar space when they visit. I would highly recommend this property and this host."
"Thanks so very much!\"",,,,,
1956275,10152983,2014-02-03,11012172,Leigh,We had a wonderful weekend at Emmanuel's house! Very convenient location in Jamaica Plain and easy access to Boston was perfect for our family gathering. Spacious and comfortable accomodations for a trip to Boston! Loved the restaurants in the neighborhood! Thanks for the hospitality!
1956275,10432423,2014-02-18,11735979,Jose,Emmanuel has been a great host! There was a big snow storm coming and he was worried about us all time.
House is really nice and comfy. Moreover there is well located with restaurants and shops near.,,,,,

We make family meeting several times and each time everyone felt absolutly like we are at home.,,,,,
"Recommended!\"",,,,,
1956275,11134047,2014-03-22,3532851,Carolyn,"Great house in awesome location. Had a great time. Comfy beds, easy parking situation (such a pain in Boston usually), and really nice person to deal with. We would definitely stay again!"
1956275,11313518,2014-03-29,6649689,Yousef,Emmanuel is a very friendly and helpful person and the house location is very good. We will differently consider staying there again.
1956275,11432141,2014-04-02,12218972,Audrey,Emmanuel was so wonderful! We are film students at Boston University. We stayed in Emmanuel's house for an extended weekend and used it as the set of our senior thesis project. The house was beautiful and clean. Emmanuel was so helpful and answered any questions that we had.
"\"",,,,,
1956275,11541471,2014-04-07,12534998,Krysta,Emmanuel's house was spacious and clean. We had a great time and everthing we needed was supplied. He was a great host!
1956275,11634567,2014-04-10,3676948,Rachel,"This is a lovely home -- very clean and spacious with a large backyard. I stayed here with my 2 year old and nanny. They walked easily to Jamaica Pond and to the Tot Lot in JP; they also took a music class downtown, all within walking distance. The owner is responsive and personable. The home is located on a traffic circle so the front bedrooms can be a little loud; it's also obviously not super scenic from the front. Also, the location on a side street off the circle can be hard to reach by car -- my GPS didn't quite recognize how to get to it so that led me to a few frustrating moments before I figured out how to do it. Anyway, I put my child in a back bedroom and noise was not an issue."
1956275,11827610,2014-04-16,11669532,Cathy,"House was as shown online, nice location for our needs and comfortable, so much better than a hotel.  Emmanuel was quick to respond to questions before we arrived and to our needs after we arrived.  This was our first time using Airbnb so we weren't sure what to expect, but will definitely explore this option again for our next trip."
1956275,12144062,2014-04-24,10443020,Geno,"Our stay turned out great, the house fit our needs during our stay. Stores and diners were close by as well as the T. I would book there again"
1956275,12605579,2014-05-06,1428575,Marian,"This is a spacious, spotless, well-appointed and very comfortable house in an excellent neighbourhood. There were only two of us so we only used one bedroom but we both found the bed superbly comfortable. It was also great to have that nice desk - and as I have a bad back I especially appreciated the adjustable office chair . Emmanuel is a helpful, responsive but totally non-intrusive landlord. I can definitely recommend this accommodation."
1956275,12750608,2014-05-10,100795,David,We had a wonderful visit. The house was perfect for our Boston visit with 4 adults and 3 kids. Emmanuel was responsive and easy to work with. Check-in and check-out were smooth. The house is very comfortable and nice. Our kids loved the back yard. We love Jamaica Plain and this house was a short walk to some great shops on Centre St. Would definitely stay here again.
1956275,12878890,2014-05-13,11667979,Paul,Emmanuel was a wonderful host. He was very helpful and thoughtful and easily accessible. We would definitely stay at his home again. A spacious and beautiful home with a lovely back yard and garden. A great location. It is just a very short walk to Arnold Arboretum and Jamaica Pond. Only 12 min drive to Brookline.
1956275,12985107,2014-05-16,5836474,Vanessa,Lovely house in a very convenient location. Perfectly clean and had plenty of space and places to relax. Looking forward to coming here again!
1956275,13560100,2014-05-31,10451518,Eva,"The house is lovely and in a beautiful part of Boston. Quiet, family neighborhood. The house was clean but had a strong odor- I think it was cat urine. Emmanuel was not flexible on check in/ key pick up and as a result my husband had to leave my graduation reception to accommodate him. The sheets were old and covered in pills. Emmanuel also never answered when I asked him after our stay if he saw my grandmother's raincoat in the closet. He could at least respond to the question. All around would not recommend Emmanuel as a host or the house."
1956275,13649824,2014-06-02,11810115,Marlene,"Beautiful home, centrally located to Boston. Lovely garden in which  to enjoy your morning coffee and listen to the singing of the birds. I highly recommend a stay here."
1956275,13817630,2014-06-05,14241433,Roland,"Had a great stay there - spacious rooms, good location. The kids loved the garden. Emmanuel was responsive and easy to contact."
"\"",,,,,
1956275,14427631,2014-06-19,13583740,Lynn,"Our host was quite accommodating, especially since our plane was very late and we arrived after midnight on a Friday night.  BUT, we were six people, three generations, and we picked this house because the listing said it had 1.5 baths and a W/D. The 1/2 bath and W/D areas were under construction! No big deal with the W/D but sharing one bath was not what we paid for or what was advertised. We would have looked elsewhere but after arriving we just didn't have the time and we were in a strange city. The subway access was a pretty long walk and that was okay, but at night required a cab since the walk is very dark and not safe. We wanted to be close to Brookline but without a car it was hard to use public transportation to get there easily. The house was clean and had everything we needed. We all liked the beds. The dining room had only 4 chairs. The listing needs to reflect what is actually there or the price needs to be adjusted! Because of the location we had to use cabs more than we anticipated. The house is a bit far out from downtown and there is lots of traffic in front of it because it is located on a traffic circle which also seemed to confuse the cabs. The room air conditioners were adequate for us but it wasn't really hot when we were there in June. The closest convenience mart was 1/2 mile away. Never found a grocery store in walking distance but we didn't really need one. This location would not be good for elderly or anyone who can't walk very far and probably is best for renters with a car. The  WiFi worked great."
1956275,14770546,2014-06-26,7980496,Ron,"Our stay at Emmanuel's home got off to a great start.  We were coming in on 2 different flights and he was very flexible in setting a time to meet at the house. Emmanuel was very helpful with providing the best GPS setting for guiding us to his home. It was still a little tricky to find for the first time.  I would recommend meeting him at the house during daylight hours. This was the first time my parents had ever been to an airbnb.  We were a little nervous, but everything turned out great.  The house was clean and ready with fresh towels on each bed as well as items for breakfast like cereal and coffee.  He had a binder ready with information about the wi-fi, and nearby restaurants and stores. Whenever we had a question, we would just text him and he responded within a short time. The home does have stairs up to to the front door.  My parents are in their mid 70's and had no problems.The house had a nice backyard where we could enjoy coffee in the morning.  It was centrally located for all the sight seeing we wanted to do. We all enjoyed relaxing in a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood."
1956275,14947380,2014-06-30,11771414,Lisa,"The house matched the photos, was spacious. Our first time using AirBnB not sure how this would go. His 3 ring binder did have a great deal of helpful information. We had a party of 6 in town for a wedding.  Unfortunately we had a miss communication about the TV's and cable.  We had planned to watch the World Cup games in our down time.   The house had it pro's and con's.  The main living area and bedrooms were clean.   The bathroom only had one hand towel.  When we arrived there was two bars of opened used soap in the shower.  The freezer was filthy dirty and full of food, some of the countertops had stains."
He did leave us 6 different colored bathroom towels.  Poor quality,half of them were stained and smelled spoiled so we just shared among the family.,,,,
Location was great for our needs in Jamaica Plains.  Easy to walk to the necessary locations. But like other people have noted,it's tricky when ordering cabs because of the funky address,access and roundabout.  Depending on where you need to travel this might or might not be an issue.   You do need to cross the road 4 times (because of the roundabout)  and two of the crosswalks are on curves and the traffic moves very quickly (40 MPH).  If you have children or elderly people I would take this into consideration.   The Orange Line stop is quit a distance away,at least 1 mile.  Pack sneakers to walk because Emmanuel is not very forthcoming on the distance to all the restaurants,shops and grocery stores. We did enjoyed our stay.,
"\"",,,,,
1956275,15544275,2014-07-11,16859442,Jessica,"Emmanuel was a great host. Very quick to reply and accommodating when we were arriving late. The house was fabulous, very modern and in a great location. We felt very safe and secure! We could have done with a couple of extra towels as we were staying 5 nights but we never asked so he wasn't really to blame. I would also suggest clearing the fridge and stuff in the bathroom baskets after old visitors. Not a major issue for us though because everything else was great. I would recommend this house to anyone and would stay here again. Thanks for a wonderful stay in Boston."
1956275,15666160,2014-07-14,1006858,Ali,"We just returned from a stay at Emmanuel's home.  I was alittle skeptical after reading some of the recent reviews, but we were all very pleased with the accomodations.  The home is spacious and fit the four of us very well.  It is also in a nice neighborhood and within walking distance to restaurants, shops and liquor stores. It was pretty easy to get a cab there too, you just had to explain in detail the traffic circle, which wasn't a big deal. Everything was very clean and well kept.  We loved the sunroom!  Emmanuel was flexible with our arrival time and very responsive. Overall, I would recommend this home if you are traveling to the Boston area.  For the price, you cannot beat it! Thanks Emmanuel!"
1956275,16449074,2014-07-28,11756813,Art,"We booked this house in January for a July vacation. It was listed as a single family with 1.5 baths and laundry.  Emmanuel was gracious to let us in at 1pm to drop off our stuff. We found the house clean for the most part, but only 1 bath and no laundry!  This was not a major inconvenience, but not what I paid for. We were not informed of the house being remodeled.  The cabinet where the pots were kept was dirty and the bathroom had used soap in the tub.  Also, there were wires sticking out of the wall in the hall. Most of the plugs in the house were 2 prong so we had to get adapters and an extension cord. The walk to the train took every bit of 20 min. The binder of pamphlets with sites to see and directions was helpful. Emmanuel did say he was keeping his car in the garage, of which we heard a few times. But he failed to mention that he was staying in the cellar as well!  After 3 days of running around Boston we figured that out and found it unsettling, but did not have enough time to change our accommodations. AGAIN THIS WAS LISTED AS A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE! That is what I paid for and would not have stayed knowing all this now. We also found the traffic noise was quite excessive, even with the air conditioners running, since you can see a two lane rotary from the front window. It was also hard to sleep hearing the sirens from the ambulances to the hospital 3 blocks away! I would not recommend staying there due to the noise factor and the misrepresentation of this being a single family house."
1956275,16832152,2014-08-03,15738806,Enrique,"Emmanuel es una persona muy profesional, además de que tiene la ventaja de que habla varios idiomas (inglés, español, italiano y francés). Nos dio las indicaciones necesarias para llegar a la casa y fue un excelente anfitrión. La descripción del anuncio es correcta. La casa está ubicada en un barrio hermoso, y además, está  muy cerca de la ciudad de Boston (10-20 minutos en automóvil del Museo de las Bellas Artes, el Fenway Park, Cambridge o Harvard). Estuvimos muy contentos en la propiedad."
1956275,17261712,2014-08-10,12618934,Anthony,"Beautiful house, superb location, Emmanuels description is spot on although I think he forgot to mention the large back garden and porch to sit out on at night. Emmanuel patiently waited for us on the day of our arrival, despite us being late, thanks to a long queue at the Airport Car Rental, and showed us around the house.  We, that is a family of 4 adults from England, stayed for a week and wished we had stayed longer. The house is in a perfect location, the Orange line to Boston is about 15/20mins walk or 5 mins in the car, parking at the station is $8 per day and the Interstates to all over New England are also close by. The house is spotless and spacious, has 3 good sized double bedrooms and now has 2 bathrooms and Emmanuel is in the near future having a washer/dryer fitted, probably the only thing lacking when we were there, but he did help us out, thanks for that Emmanuel. There were cereals and coffee in the kitchen which has a large fridge/freezer and a huge restaurant size cooker, there are also plenty of pans, plates, cups, cutlery. Jamaica Plain is a very nice area, with the Arboretum  across the the road and the Lake a short walk away. The area felt very safe and we walked around day and night. Centre St is where the shops and Restaurants are, this is also only a short walk. We ate at Canary Square and tried the Ice Cream at JP Licks, both very nice. We also tried Harrys All American Diner for breakfast, well worth a visit, it is just past Weld St towards W Roxbury Parkway."
The house is perfect for a young family or group of adults,is only 20 mins from the airport,"has easy access to local transport and we would not hesitate in returning.\"",,,
1956275,17669141,2014-08-16,12108429,Cristina,"The apartment is really nice, we were 6 people and had no problem of space. Emmanuel is really helpuful and was always avalaible during the process of reservation. We had a wonderful stay in Jamaica Plain, even if the subway it is not really close having a nice walk through the neighborhood was great (see the pond it is really close and it's amazing)."

1956275,19765607,2014-09-18,11647421,Stefan,"Wir waren 3 Nächte bei Emmanuel zu Gast. Die Wohnung ist komfortabel und  geräumig, aber nicht sehr gut zu finden. Erreichbar ist sie nur über die Pond Street (Einbahnstraße!). Ganz am Ende, nach dem Haus Nr. 4 kommt auf der rechten Seite, schon am Kreisverkehr der Center Street, das Haus von Emmanuel. Die zur Straße weisenden Zimmer sind deshalb ziehmlich laut. In das Zentrum von Boston konnten wir mit dem Fahrrad gut auf Radwegen entlang des Jamaika Pond und des Charles River in einer halben Stunde radeln. Für einen Boston Aufenthalt können wir die Wohnung nur empfehlen!"
1956275,21114869,2014-10-11,13869180,Susan,"The pictures were accurate, but place quite tired. We found the walk to the metro to Boston, too far and the local bars a little run down. Bedrooms ok and we liked sitting on outside terrace, but compared to our other three Airbnb  locations in US this was expensive."
1956275,21459881,2014-10-18,4046347,Ray,Emmanual welcomed us upon arrival and made my family feel welcome. The home is exactly as described and is convenient to get to. We stayed 4 days and it was a perfect base for us to do Boston sightseeing. I would stay there again when traveling to Boston.
1956275,22014075,2014-10-28,15357438,Crystal,"The house went beyond my expectations. The house is difficult to find initially as described. Once we found the house, everything else went smoothly. I was in Boston to help with a family wedding. Due to the abundant parking availability and spacious house, the house served as our headquarters. We pretty much spent all day at the house. Due to this, we did all of our cooking and eating at the house. The house has a very big kitchen with 6 burners and an oven which allowed us to save a lot of money by cooking in. The house has all necessary pots and plates to accommodate a large number of guests."
There is also a sun room that is not heated. The bride for the wedding decided to make her own center pieces so the sun room turned out to be crucial as it served as a large refrigerator for the flowers. In addition,there is a convenient washer and dryer in the house that served us very well since we stayed for a whole week.,,,,
The neighborhood is very nice as well. We took a walk every morning around the pond and the atrium. I live in a big city so this was an unexpected treat for us.,,,,,
The house is located near two big hospitals. It is true that there are ambulances with sirens driving by very frequently. However,since I am from a large city,I didn't mind at all.,,,
The house is about 20 minutes from the city. We had to rent a car to run errands for the wedding anyways. I am unsure if public transportation is convenient or not since I didn't have to use it. I would say that a car is necessary in JP but if you're going to be spending all your time in the city where parking is hard to find and expensive,I would take public transportation.,,,,
Bottom line: I would gladly rent the house again. The house made a our trip and the wedding a success. Thanks Emanuel!,,,,,

1956275,22240416,2014-11-02,21499045,Jackson,"Pictures were accurate, neighborhood was fantastic and Emmanuel had everything ready to go.  Great privacy despite host living in basement during stay...was not an issue."
1956275,23354535,2014-11-30,13056207,Jeanine,"Host was very good at communicating.  The house was as pictured.  No surprises.  It was our first time using airbnb.  It was a nice experience.  Much better spending Thanksgiving Holiday in a house, rather than a hotel."
1956275,24474922,2014-12-29,23518407,Nancy,This was a great find for our Christmas holiday. We arrived to discover the house exactly as described with the additional bonus of a beautiful live Christmas tree decorated and lit. We felt right at home and enjoyed the clean and spacious accommodations. The house has a lovely back yard that provides tranquility in an urban environment. Although the front of the house faces a traffic rotary we were surprised at how little we noticed traffic noise. The location is great and allows for walking to all the shops and eateries in Jamaica Plain as well as parks and public transportation. We loved not having to rely on a car or public transportation to get around the area. Emmanuel was very responsive to our needs and questions. It was a great stay!
1956275,24636805,2015-01-01,9628280,Stephen,My wife and I needed a 2 night stay on the west side of Boston with our son/wife/2 year old.  We were visiting to spend time with my 96 year old father who lives in a retirement community in Needham.  This rental met our needs very well.   It was a perfect size for the 5 of us and was impeccably clean.  The layout was great for an energetic 2 year old.  The kitchen served well for our modest meal preparation.  The traffic circle is far enough removed from the house that we were not particularly bothered by traffic noise.   We enjoyed the bonus of a fragrant Christmas tree that was provided in the living room!
It was a bit too cold to enjoy the beautiful parklands in the vicinity but those would be a delight at many times of the year.,,,,,

1956275,25774046,2015-01-25,9862087,Amanda,"The house had a pretty strong odor when we arrived. I got used to it by the first night but it was a little gross at first. The area of Jamaica Plain is cute. It was a nice walk to the little downtown area with restaurants and shops but it's not a short walk! The closest grocery store was over a mile away (whole foods). The house is situated right across from a large traffic circle. I'm not a light sleeper but I was woken up several times by ambulances with their sirens blaring both nights. There are 2 hospitals very close to the house. The house was ok, nothing to get too excited about. Emmanuel lives below the house which isn't very well detailed in the listing. He was very pleasant when we met to get the keys and then we didn't see him for the rest of the weekend."
1956275,26170493,2015-02-05,14344099,Richard,This was a great experience. The house was perfect for a last minute trip to Boston- very spacious but cozy.

1956275,26545673,2015-02-15,26708094,Courtney,"There were no surprises with the house. It's an older home, but is clean, comfortable and met our needs perfectly. The off street parking was great because there was so much snow on the ground! Emmanuel was quick to reply to messages, and even though he lives in the basement we only saw him when we were digging our car out after yet another foot of snow. Due to the weather, we didn't do much sightseeing... but JP is a lovely neighborhood."
1956275,27162655,2015-02-27,6721669,Greta,"This was the cleanest and most comfortable airbnb I've stayed at yet. It was nice and warm in the dead of winter, and Emmanuel followed through on his promise of off-site parking, even when that meant shoveling out 100 inches of snow in the driveway before we arrived. I think he may have even come and put fresh salt on the steps early one morning to make sure we didn't slip in these icy conditions. Beds were soft and comfortable, bathrooms were super clean, kitchen was well stocked, and the couch was very comfortable for lounging. Thanks for a great stay!"
1956275,27647575,2015-03-09,6229054,Enrique,Great house for 5 people. Clean and espacious.
"Had a very good time here.\"",,,,,
1956275,28633197,2015-03-27,29778346,Maria,I booked my work crew there for a week.  We wanted to stay for the remaining three weeks we were working up in Boston.  Unfortunately it was not available.  We would go back anytime.  My guys were so impressed they said he was awesome! They would recommend to anyone.  The location was perfect for getting into downtown Boston and the nearby businesses were cool and there were great places in walking distance to eat!
1956275,28725546,2015-03-29,28271282,Blane,"Stayed at Emmanuel's 3 Bed 2 Bath home the weekend of Mar 27th to Mar 29th. Took my son, and a few guests to a Bruins, Rangers game on the Saturday of our stay. The location to the city is Ideal. Quick drive to say the least. His home was perfect. More Blankets, Sheets, towels then we ever needed. The Apt. was Clean, and most importantly, cozy. Makes you forget why one would ever stay at a Hotel. Emmanuel was quick to my texts (trouble with the (URL HIDDEN) fault) would stay there again in a heartbeat...Thank you Emmanuel for sharing your place."
1956275,28919519,2015-03-31,30017310,Shakeela,The host made us  welcome. The house looked as it was on the website and was  comfortable but was smaller than what it looked like on the website. The house is located at the corner of a one way street so if you do not take the right turning it was difficult to get back to the house. My navigation always invariably took us the wrong way.
1956275,30125161,2015-04-18,5792570,Magda,"I booked this house for clients coming into town for 2 weeks. While a little hard to initially find, our clients were thrilled to pieces with Emmanuel's home and found it very easy to access public transportation and otherwise get around."
Emmanuel responded to any questions immediately,"and was in frequent contact with me throughout their stay. I would absolutely look to rent this home again in the future.\"",,,,
1956275,30437235,2015-04-22,17258458,Dustin,"Great home to stay in. Truly blocks from JP. Large home, near public transit. Would rent again."
1956275,32160313,2015-05-15,4143054,Amith,Emmanuel was a very good host. Had booked the place for my parents who were traveling from abroad to take a tour of Boston. The stay was pretty comfortable and was big enough to accommodate everybody. Emmanuel immediately installed ACs as soon as we let him know that it was getting a lil hot in the house. The summer had  set in. All in all nice place to stay. Ther's a beautiful pond nearby and the Harvard arboretum.The orange line is a 5 min walk. I would stay here again.
1956275,32489884,2015-05-19,22757476,Marcia,"Property was exactly as presented and we enjoyed our stay. Simply but thoughtfully furnished. Nice neighborhood, parking spot, super secure. House was immaculately clean. Lovely sunroom overlooking large back yard, nice for morning coffee. Host was very welcoming. Definitely recommend in this area of Boston and would return. Nicely done!"
1956275,32785984,2015-05-21,1639857,Di,"Emmanuel's place was lovely, spacious and clean. It's great for a family vacation. We had a great time and would highly recommend it to anyone! Thank you Emmanuel!"
1956275,33092052,2015-05-25,29816012,Lucia,La descripción era correcta y el barrio muy lindo. Nos pareció que le hubiera faltado un poco de limpieza en cuartos y cocina. El barrio es residencial y nosotros estábamos con auto entonces no hubo problemas con el transporte. La atención de Emanuel fue adecuado.
1956275,33489855,2015-05-29,17380916,Joyce,We had a pleasant stay. Emmanuel was kind to allow us check in earlier than expected. There is easy access in and out of Boston. Even to the center of Jamaica Plains. We will definitely come back.
1956275,43343236,2015-08-18,36163284,Haochen,"Awesome house, spacious and beautiful! Emmanuel is super responsive and helpful."
1956275,44605350,2015-08-27,14137910,Dan,"Emmanuel was very accommodating of our late entry and arranged for my son to get the key after 11 pm.  House was as advertised and perfect for our needs.  A bit difficult to get to the house via gps the first time, but once you learn, no problem.  Close to JP shops and restaurants and to the pond.  Nice garden.  Fronting on a busy street was the only downside, but it made little difference.  Lovely screen porch in rear made a nice gathering place for drinks and conversation at the end of the day.  Emmanuel was most helpful and responsive.  When my son's fiancé left her research papers at the house, he mailed them back.  Service with smile.  Had a great time overall."
1956275,45473475,2015-09-03,12063691,Aishat,Emanuel was a good host. He made my family feel welcome and was very graceful with adjusting to our needs and travel set-backs. He communicated well.
1956275,55340108,2015-12-01,31092238,Richard,"This apartment is great! I stayed here for two months with my wife and daughter. The apartment is in good shape and secure. The owner is a very nice person and always ready for advice and help!! The location is perfect with the beautiful Arnold Arboretum (which is a nice place to spend your family Sunday) across the street and the Jamaica Pond (nice for running) a couple of blocks away. Jamaica plain has a small but nice center with a bunch of nice shops and restaurants. With our daughter we spent a lot of time at the nice playground there. Public transport to Boston is OK but sometimes slow; for example, at 7am the bus to Longwood medical area takes about 15 minutes but during rush hour this can easily be 45 minutes. The orange line requires a short walk but provides a perfect connection to downtown Boston. We would definitely return to this place!"
1956275,56440661,2015-12-13,24781250,Zhang,"The place is really great. quiet peaceful and lovely. Tho you have to have a car, otherwise it will be a little far"
1956275,56879205,2015-12-19,48333031,Zhaokun,"The house is very clean, silent, and comfortable. It is convenient to drive from this house to downtown."
1956275,60877916,2016-01-29,43318549,Tsu Ping,"First of all, there was delay in our flights andf Emmanuel waited for us till 11 p.m. to receive us. Our rental car parked in front of his garage and not on the street."
Then the heater thermostat had some issue on Sunday morning ( of the New Year long weekend ) and Emmanuel immediately got someone to fix it the same day,after receiving our message. He understood our dependance on the heating in the house as this is our first Boston winter,and acted without any questioning.,,,
There is a bus stop ( Bus #38 ) 1 minute from his house which we took to get to Forest Hills T-Station ( last station of the Orange line ). It took us 15-20 mins walk to the T-station on Sunday when Bus #38 is not in service. We used the Orange line to get to wherever we want rather conveniently. Boston T has weekly and monthly Bus & Train passes which is a cheap way to travel wihtout the high expenses to park your car in downtown.,,,,,
Overall,the descriptions and photos are accurate and Emmanuel's house we are very glad that we made the right choice to stay in his house. Overall,it is a steal,if his house is available on the dates of your requirement. Definitely a host and a house you don't want to miss in Boston.,,

1956275,61636305,2016-02-07,40832201,绣wen,"It is a very good place, very beautiful, good location,we all love it"
1956275,62815180,2016-02-17,9927799,Summer,Great home in a quiet neighborhood at a great price!  Home was roomy for a family of 5.
1956275,64082570,2016-02-29,54628595,Christine,Emmanuel was a wonderful host! He made us feel very welcome & was sure to let us know if we needed him for anything do not hesitate to call. We didn't have any reason to call him as the house had everything we needed for our stay. The house was located close to entertainment & restaurant's. Also close to the T which was very convenient. When we weren't out having a good time we were more than comfortable hanging out in the very spacious living room. We were a group of adults but we would have been just as comfortable had we brought along our kids. Maybe next time!
1956275,66181752,2016-03-20,57399728,Alex,"Nous avons grandement apprécié notre présence dans le logement de Emmanuel. C'est grand et propre et situé dans un quartier paisible. C'est proche d'une rue passante, qui fait un peu de bruit, mais on est en ville donc c'est très acceptable. En utilisant Uber, se rendre au centre ville coûte environ 12-15 USD, ce qui est très raisonnable. Je recommande cet endroit. Pour plus de 4 personnes, le rapport qualité et prix est probablement le meilleur qu'on peut avoir."
Les forces : Emmanuel nous a fait faire le tour de l'appartement et des choses à savoir,il y a de la place pour stationner des voitures dans l'entrée,et dans la rue. L'endroit est propre et dans un milieux sécuritaire.,,,
À savoir : Il ne semble pas y avoir de commerces très accessible,donc prévoir les arrêts pour faire les provisions de nourriture et de breuvages en s'y rendant. Pour faciliter le transport,"sélectionner dans votre GPS une adresse sur May St. Même chose quand vous fournissez les adresses aux taxis ou à Uber.\"",,,
1956275,68016321,2016-04-01,13835291,Graciela,"I rented this house for my daughter and her young family while they were painting her house immediately after she had her baby.   The house location is very convenient, with all the amenities for a short or long stay.  Parking for two cars is also a nice feature for the lodgers as well as for visitors.  Emmanuel was very helpful and accomodating to my requests for checking-in early after the hospital dismissal.  This was a great find and I am sure that my family will go back to this house when visiting Boston again."
1956275,68335602,2016-04-04,56217933,Sarah,"I have just got back from Boston.. Stayed in this house with four friends.. We loved it, Emmanuel was great, we had a issue with one of the taps, Emmanuel fixed it straight away.. We also liked the area of Jamaica Plain, it's very relaxed there, a few good bars and restaurants, and not to far from town, it's about 10 minutes in a taxi.. I would recommend staying here.."
1956275,69166086,2016-04-09,65384906,Kanav,The house was very nice and I had a very good experience.

La casa es muy comoda , agradable e iluminada. Tiene una ubicación de fácil acceso a los distintos lugares de la ciudad. Recomiendo para quien viene a Boston"

1956275,72037902,2016-04-30,56743733,Marcia,"Emmanuel was very communicative before our stay & the information he provides at the house covers most anything you need to know. The house is located within walking distance to restaurants/shops in JP & a bus stop which takes you to the Orange line to get anywhere you want to go in Boston! The house is very nice, clean & I highly recommend it! The description is quite accurate & Emmanuel is a wonderful host. My family and I enjoyed a great first Airbnb & Boston experience!"
1956275,73404130,2016-05-08,33313393,Cynthia,"We were visiting Boston with our family for our daughter's graduation from Northeastern University.  Emmanuel's home was just as described and nicely accommodated us.  The location is wonderful for walking to shops, restaurants, bars and the T."
1956275,74574736,2016-05-15,48863141,Tina,"We felt welcome to the place and it was adequate for our needs, location good for our event."
"The place was clean and neat but the linens are really shabby. I would suggest new towels and sheets. And more bed pillows. The rates are not unlike a hotel and I feel a similar quality of amenities would make this a more pleasant stay. \"",,,,,
1956275,76110695,2016-05-24,32260165,Morgan,Emmanuel was very helpful and the apartment was just as pictured. Plenty of space and a large backyard. Would recommend!
1956275,76523879,2016-05-28,4097452,Kavita,"The home was exactly as described - well decorated, very neat and clean, firm mattresses, and beautiful back yard. Emmanuel was fantastic in cooperating with our fluctuating arrival time and helping us navigate to his home when the GPS failed us. Overall experience was extremely positive and we look forward to staying here again next time we visit!"
1956275,84336625,2016-07-06,47202132,Lars,"Our familiy of 5 rented Emmanuels place for 5 weeks in June/July. The location of the house is the biggest asset, perfect for exploring Boston and the surrounding Jamaica Plain community. It is located close to a busy round-about, but the house is spacious, convenient and family friendly. The house has a very nice back garden which the kids enjoyed to play in. Emmanuel was a great host being both service mined and pleasant to interact with. He was also patient with the kids who probably made a lot of noice, this was important to us as he also lives in the house. We were not aware of this upon arrival, but it was no problem for us throughout the stay. Overall we would recommend this house for others to rent."
6870366,37594824,2015-07-08,33503007,Kyle,Bernie welcomed me when I arrived by showing me around the very secure building and showing me all the facilities the building offers. He offered a very clean and comfortable room with a few toiletries to boot. The neighborhood is very safe with most people you encounter being employed by the medical schools. Bernie was very gracious by offering tips to the city and privacy.
6870366,37709602,2015-07-09,36646208,Delia,"The bed was really comfortable. Lots of privacy was given. Once again, Bernie was such an awesome host. He never fails to offer a helping hand and makes sure that I was comfortable during my stay. He gives the best he can to host his guests. Room was really spacious and comfortable. During my stay he has shared with me many life experiences and taught me life lessons. A memorable stay indeed."
6870366,37794601,2015-07-10,32128492,Tina,"Bernie was a most gracious host, including making a cup of tea for me. I enjoyed his conversation, but more importantly the room was clean, quiet, and appointed with niceties such as shampoo, soap, and a bottle of water.  It was a very pleasant stay and I thank Bernie for being a wonderful host."
6870366,38012222,2015-07-12,35907199,Gino,"Bernie was a great host and I will suggest this place to anyone who's thinking about staying around this area. The apartment was clean, organized, safe and most importantly the host Bernie was friendly and willing to make my staying as comfortable as possible."
6870366,38205032,2015-07-13,619108,Christine,"This was a great place to crash for a low price. Bernie was a great host and was very communicative, meeting me to let me into the building, describing everything I needed to know about access to the building/ room (which has a separate lock) and offering extra blankets."
The room is very sparse. It is in a 2 bedroom apartment where the common room is partially used as Bernie's office. The room is very minimally decorated (lots of hooks and various home goods with the tags still on them,no art,decor or throw pillows). The linens were clean and the mattress was moderately comfortable. It was a little unclear,but it seemed that the other bedroom is rented out separately (and also has its own lock),so you could end up with two Airbnb guest groups in the two rooms.,
I needed just 1 night to stay after I flew into Boston before departing for another location so this was ideal. I would not recommend this Airbnb if you plan to spend a lot of time in the apartment,"but it is great if you just want an inexpensive place to sleep!\"",,,,
6870366,38350412,2015-07-14,9326014,Juan Carlos,Thank you Bernie
6870366,38427244,2015-07-15,6279611,Meghan,Bernie was a great host. He took the time to show me around and point out things in the area. I was only there for one night but it was very comfortable!
6870366,40607109,2015-08-01,35844804,Leo,Thanks a lot for a really great stay in Boston Bernard! The apartment is exactly as described and is perfect for anyone working in the Harvard medical school area. Bernard was a really accommodating host who went that extra mile to ensure I had everything i needed. I stayed two weeks without a single problem. The apartment is situated above a food court and CVS pharmacy with an ATM close by and a subway bike station over the road. Its a nice and safe area of Boston. If i come back to Boston i would happily stay here again.
6870366,40787111,2015-08-02,36667935,Andreas,Bernie has been a great host. He is very forthcoming on the arrival time and tries to meet with you on your schedule. The room was clean and Bernie supplies you with all necessary thinks you need for your stay. Starting with towels and ending with a city guide and/or suggestions where to go he makes you feel at home. Another plus is that the room can be locked. Go and stay with Bernie and enjoy!
6870366,41231347,2015-08-05,27161523,Maryam,"Bernie was a great host. He kindly allowed me to have an early check-in, and showed me around. The description is accurate. The building is secure, and the apartment is clean and lots of privacy was given."
6870366,41515781,2015-08-07,40166507,Shramana,"I picked this listing because of the great reviews, and I have to say that they are justified. I stayed here only for a night, and Bernie was kind enough to coordinate the check-in and check-out time with my work schedule. The area is excellent - very secure, within walking distance to the BFA and many of the schools and hospitals. Bernie is a very gracious host; he made sure to show me where everything was, and spent some time giving me a general overview of the area. The ambiance in the apartment and the room is very nice - there are plenty of clean towels and toiletries in case you need anything."
6870366,41643692,2015-08-08,27865716,Connie,"Bernie was a wonderful host. He showed us around his apartment and had his room extremely well prepared for guests. The stay was very comfortable and the AC was nice due to the heat outside. Thank you, Bernie!"

6870366,42437393,2015-08-13,39071963,Jimmie,"Bernie was a friendly and very accommodating host. He allowed me to have an early check-in, and greeted me personally upon my arrival. He provided me with keys, and showed me how to get to the room. The location and description of the room were accurate. Public transportation was readily available. The room, bedding, bathroom and towels were very clean. The bed was comfortable. There is a food court off of the lobby, with the usual assortment of fast food if you didn't want to go out and eat. You have access to the kitchen, which is fully equipped. All in all, I had a pleasant stay."
6870366,42913690,2015-08-16,39225308,Aaron,Bernie was a great host in a very nice apartment. He gave great tips about how to get around Boston.
6870366,43259568,2015-08-18,34254573,Matthew,Bernard's apartment was in a great location- 15 mins walk from Fenway Park and easy access to the T green line. The meeting point was very close to the apartment as well and easy to find.
The room was lockable,comfy bed,all amenities provided. There are actually two bedrooms here,but they seemed similar in size. Bernie was a great guy who has a real passion for Boston and provided maps and a few tourist brochures. He spent some time pointing things out around the city from the rooftop which was appreciated- great views and put everything in perspective.,,

The room was clean, tidy and everything necessary was provided. Location is good, about a 20 min walk in to the main area of the city. Very happy with my stay here and would recommend."
6870366,51115690,2015-10-18,35808416,Faye,This was my first experience with Airbnb but I discovered that my apprehensions were unfounded. The bed was extremely comfortable and the location was walking distance to Boston University and also very close to the Green Line.  It is a highly populated area so it is safe to walk alone at night. Bernie made sure to let me know that he was available if I had any questions or needed anything. I would highly recommend this room and Bernie as host.
6870366,51343607,2015-10-19,18462779,Zody,"Bernie was an absolutely great host. The listing itself is more than I could ask for with a GREAT view of the city. He's literally thought of everything you may need or forget to pack while you're traveling. As a host, he was very accommodating in making sure I was welcomed, I knew how to get from place to place, and gave me a great tour of the building. If I ever return to Boston, I would book this spot again without hesitation."

He also made sure I was put in direct contact with his assistant, as he was going out of town, and Utril was an amazing host as well and quickly responded to inquiries."
As far as the apartment,it truly exceeded expectations. I found my room fully stocked with far more than you even get in a regular hotel room. There were multiple unopened soaps,a plethora of fresh clean towels (far more than any one or two people should ever need!),candles,shampoos,lint rollers--there was even an option of 2 different hair dryers!
The bed was comfortable,the bathroom was clean,the bed was extremely comfortable,and the location is impeccable. It's fairly central to the city,"and remarkably convenient as there is a CVS and a food court in the lobby of the building. Superb!

The price was good and the location is in a great part of town and less than a minute from the hospitals so perfect for those visiting them (especially if you come in the winter and don't like walking in the cold). I'll be back as soon as I can and I highly recommend the listing.
6870366,58215171,2016-01-01,51543982,LaVonia,Bernie made my first Airbnb experience a lovely one.  He was very accommodating when my plane was delayed and I missed the 2:00 check in.

The bed is really comfortable and the room is quite spacious. The room also has everything you will need from a shoe brush to extension cords. The location is also amazing. Everything you need is available within the building or just around the corner. Especially if you are visiting Boston for business, everything is taken care of."

6870366,63344610,2016-02-22,34590936,David,"Bernie is a wonderful host and explains everything you need to know. The room was very nice, comfortable, and contained every conceivable amenity I might need and then some.  I was able to iron my shirt and get a peaceful night's sleep, which was really all I needed. There is a gorgeous view from the rooftop, well worth appreciating for a bit. You have very convenient access to a drugstore and multiple food options without even leaving the building. I felt safe walking around the neighborhood at night. The location is a short walk from the T, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Boston Children's. This was a perfect place to stay while in town for an interview."

6870366,65423757,2016-03-13,61727345,Satyavrat,"Overall my experience of staying at this place was pleasant and satisfying. It was unfortunate that there was a power cut in the building when I checked-in at 9pm. I learn from Bernie that it was a one-off for preventive maintenance. However, I must say that Bernie did everything possible to help us tide over the situation by providing adequate battery operated lamps etc. Water supply stoppage was surprising to Bernie too but he did his best to make water available. Both power and water supply resumed at 4am in the morning and things were fine after that."
I did not realise that the bathroom is shared with another room. But it was ok. I guess,that can be made explicit in the listing.,,,,
Bernie is indeed a very warm host and does his best to make your stay comfortable. In my case,"he even offered grocery available in his kitchen so make breakfast for myself. \"",,,,

6870366,84260948,2016-07-06,43354351,Jared,"Bernie was very professional throughout my experience with him.  He took time to show us around the place and explain everything to us, despite our late arrival.  He was very flexible and accommodating to our travel arrangements.  The room was awesome.  The wifi was great, the bed was very comfortable, there were ample pillows, he had extra amenities in case we forgot, everything was clean.  One great benefit of this place is the incredible view from the 25th floor that we had access to.  Overall, I cannot recommend this place highly enough."
6870366,84287850,2016-07-06,79055453,Chenglei,"Bernie is a great host. His place is clean and comfortable as he advertised. He showed me the room and all the stuff I could use. He also showed me around the premises, which were great and very convenient. The food court is within the same building. I had supper and breakfast in the food court during my stay. This place is very close to where I was visiting (only a 5~7 minutes walk), and I enjoyed the walk through the tall buildings (I came from a small town with not many tall buildings.) Overall, I enjoyed my stay and appreciated Bernie's hospitality."
6870366,84557199,2016-07-08,15491807,Jennifer,"My stay at Bernie's was perfect. I was only in town for one night, but it was exactly what I needed. His place is very close to the T and Fenway.  The T system is great so there is really no need for a car. Bernie was very accommodating for an early arrival and late departure. He had a place for me to leave my bags so I could go roam the city. Next time I come to Boston, I will want to stay here."
6870366,85132996,2016-07-10,26083080,Zach,"Bernie was awesome. The place was in the perfect location for the school I was in town to visit. The food court beneath the building was extremely convenient. The apartment was just what I thought it would be. The bed was comfortable and there were plenty of toiletries and towels to use. When I arrived, Bernie met me promptly and showed me around the building and the apartment."
6870366,85527842,2016-07-11,63762760,Ginny,"Bernie was a great host, showing me around and making sure I knew where things were. I was just there for a quick overnight so didn't check out the shops on the main floor of the building. Quiet, comfortable bed, and good location.  No doubt I'll be back when I'm in the area again!"
6870366,86027308,2016-07-14,24071737,Faby,Bernie waited for me outside his apartment and helped me carry my luggages.
6870366,86212455,2016-07-15,28475644,Lynna,"Bernie's place is just as described. Comfortable, quiet, clean, and convenient. Highly recommended."
6870366,87267576,2016-07-19,77465263,Emily,"Bernie was a wonderful host. Just what we needed for Boston. We got a nice air conditioned room with a very comfortable bed. Bernie gave us a quick tour of the complex, some quick tips on where to visit, and then let us loose.  He allowed us to drop off our luggage early and pick it up after checkout so we weren't hauling it around Boston.  Great guy!"
6870366,87663736,2016-07-21,29228623,Leslie,"Wonderful experience, Bernie is a great host, the bed is like sleeping on a cloud, the location is fantastic. This is the best Airbnb experience I have had to date."
6870366,88854145,2016-07-25,76907969,Amanda,Bernie was very hospitable and the room was immaculately appointed. His apartment was within easy walking distance of Fenway Park and the riverfront. I lost some property and he was super helpful in putting me into contact with staff who could help. I would recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to be in this location. Thanks Bernie.
6870366,89475687,2016-07-28,65676186,York,"This is my first Airbnb experience and it's really wonderful! Bernie is very nice, taking me go around the room, public places and explain the whole things elaborately when I arrived. The room is very clean and comfort, I love it very much! There is a food court under the apartment, so it's pretty convenient when having a meal ! I enjoyed the two night stay at Bernie's place! I'll no doubt choose to stay here again when I visit Boston next time!!"
6870366,89645556,2016-07-29,19364753,Michelle,Bernie did a great job showing me around the apartment and building. The room and bathroom was completely stocked with all the amenities that I needed. The bed was super soft. Excellent host! Would definitely stay here again.

6870366,90630065,2016-08-01,21987589,Liz,"Bernie was communicative prior to my stay and made it easy to check in and get settled. The accommodations were very clean, comfortable, and provided a lot of extra toiletries and amenities that I was not expecting. Thanks, Bernie!"
6870366,91242257,2016-08-04,78484379,Hafsa,Exactly how it was described in listing. Bernie was really kind to show me around and helped my finding my way. Will stay there again .
6870366,91765051,2016-08-06,77664643,Thomas,"Bernie was very good communicating with me before my arrival with regards to directions on where and how to find him and the room.  His responses to my questions or concerns (parking, arrival time, etc) were quick as well.  Bernie was personable and was conscientious as he showed me around the apartment, being sure I understood how things worked and where to find toiletries, towels, food, coffee, etc."
6870366,92392306,2016-08-08,14021243,Rosa,Bernie fue super simpático. La casa esta muy limpia y ordenada y tiene a disposición todo aquello que pueda ser necesario.  La localización es también muy buena. Estuve muy cómoda y a gusto en mi estancia :).
6870366,92581381,2016-08-09,2490426,Carol,My stay at Bernie's was short but wonderful. I was worn out from the trip and found the room so cozy and comfortable that I fell asleep and awoke just in time to attend my event. Fenway was a short walk and enjoyable both to and from the event later in the evening.
The bed was amazing and Bernie supplied everything that could possibly be needed to ensure a peaceful,relaxed stay. The toiletries were varied and abundant.,,,,
I did not get to spend much time with Bernie which I regret as he seems like an interesting host. He showed me the space including laundry area,roof deck and emergency exits to be sure I was safe and secure in my surroundings. Much appreciated.,,,,
I would highly recommend Bernie's place and hope to return one day when I have more time to explore the area.,,,,,

6870366,94637797,2016-08-16,31049627,Madeline,"The stay with Bernie went well. I was new to the city, and I was staying with him before my apartment became available the next week. Bernie was very helpful with explaining the transit system and telling me where to go."
The room was very comfortable and every amenity you could think of was available. There was another guest in the room down the hall,but overall very private. Bernie also does work in the apartment in a secluded office space.,,,,
If needed,"I would stay with Bernie again! Overall lovely stay. \"",,,,
6870366,95146563,2016-08-18,3394017,John,Excellent accommodations and excellent welcome!
6870366,95711106,2016-08-20,13021320,Lynn,"Bernie made my transition into Boston very welcoming. I had my own frustrations which he helped me let go of, and made a special effort to be sure i had all in needed, as a new person in Boston and a short visitor to the city. He also shared his love for the JFK presidential Library."
6870366,96358867,2016-08-22,46822712,Feiyu,"这间房子就在哈佛医学院旁边。基本的日用品房东都提供的很齐全。除此之外,房子里的厨房、冰箱也是开放使用。房东人非常好,给我们介绍了周边而且对于我们的疑问给予十分有用的回答。床很软很舒服,地毯也很干净。"
6870366,96607316,2016-08-23,3394017,John,"Well, I re-booked for the second stay before I checked out from the first stay!  And I want to say thanks for an unexpected good cup of java!"

6870366,98719180,2016-09-01,21658983,Beth,"This is an excellent stay near the top floor of a beautiful apartment building. Definitely a secure experience for those traveling alone -- locks on the bedroom doors if you choose to use them, and the shared bathroom in the apartment is clean and private. Bernie provides lots of helpful items -- slippers, robes, toiletries. Plus, guests have access to a wonderful roof deck. The location is great -- minutes from Dana Farber, Boston Children's Hospital, Beth Israel, etc etc."
6276572,36457884,2015-06-28,36012262,Mary,Andrew's place is an extremely convenient location for getting to the orange line and everywhere we wanted to go in the city.  It was also a great neighborhood to explore.  Andrew had great recommendations for restaurants.  It is a very cozy home.
6276572,41984662,2015-08-10,6324987,Christopher,Fantastic place in one of the best neighborhoods in Boston. Andrew was flexible with my schedule and accommodating in every way. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Boston.
6276572,42866195,2015-08-16,35545609,Brent,"Andrew was an amazing host. He met us @ 1 AM (!) to let us in since our flight was so late. Andrew provided excellent instructions for the apartment and it was in very clean, tidy condition. He also followed up with us all weekend to ensure we were having a blast in Boston, providing recommendations and seeing if we needed anything at the place. This apartment is in a perfect, pretty location that is close to many great bars and restaurants. We are super happy with our experience and if we make it back to Boston anytime soon we are definitely staying here again, thanks Andrew!"
6276572,45115715,2015-08-31,20757176,Emily,"My mom and I visited Boston and had the pleasure of staying at Andrew's apartment. This AirBnB experience was the best and most professional AirBnB experience I've ever had. Andrew and his girlfriend, Julia, were prompt, welcoming, and really just had it together. The apartment was centrally located, beautifully decorated, and very comfortable. We really couldn't have found a better place to stay! My mom and I were very impressed with both the accommodation and the professionalism of our stay."
6276572,45969167,2015-09-07,39256940,Geoffrey,"Andrew was a fantastic host. We couldn't have asked for a better located or more charming house to spend our long weekend in. Andrew left us a list of places to check out during our stay and made clear that he was available should we have any issues, which we did not. His house is located in such a beautiful neighborhood, we found ourselves walking almost everywhere since there was so much, so close. Next time we come to Boston, we will definitely see if Andrew's place is available again!"
6276572,51184335,2015-10-18,9908182,Nino,Andrew did everything to make us familiar with the neighborhood and welcome once we arrived. The area was great for being steps from action but still set back in a quaint neighborhood. Everything was great! Highly recommended!
6276572,51975618,2015-10-25,1281062,Karyn,"Andrew was beyond accommodating in making sure I could check in and check out in coincidence with an event I was attending in an area, which was a huge plus. He walked me through everything in the apartment, including the coffee maker, where a bag of fresh Dunkin' Donuts coffee was waiting for me, and though I'm a Boston native, there was a helpful list of things to do and see in the area available for my perusal. The apartment is MUCH bigger than the photos appear—and yet the space felt intimate and homey, almost akin to a European flat. If you're looking for a centrally-located place in the city, and plan on spending most of your time out and about, this is your place."
6276572,52329188,2015-10-28,44303281,Caroline,Beautiful flat with tons of Boston charm. My reception was easy and lovely. Andrew made lots of great recommendations and they were all spot on. And the neighborhood is absolutely fantastic. Super walkable with lots of shops and eateries a stone's throw from your door.
6276572,52784010,2015-11-01,9838819,Aakash,Andrew was super welcoming and helpful. Really nice guy and a beautiful place.
6276572,67674941,2016-03-30,14135177,Anna,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6276572,73751146,2016-05-09,45931889,Alex,"After a long flight to the East Coast for a family vacation, Andrew and Julia welcomed my boyfriend and I to their beautiful home. They made sure we were comfortable with fresh towels, beers in the fridge, and plenty of great recommendations around Boston before heading off for the weekend. We had a blast and really enjoyed their place. The location was perfect  - lots of restaurants and markets close by, easy to get anywhere in the city. Definitely recommend!"
6276572,78185390,2016-06-05,1509075,Alyssa,"Andrew's place is in a perfect part of the city. Easy to walk around, quiet, safe. The apartment has all the amenities you might need, and Andrew graciously even left us some beer! Couch is super comfy, and it's overall clean. Only complaint is the bed is quite small - it's just a double. My husband and I are on the taller side, and not only was it cramped for sleeping, our feet hung off the end. If you like sleeping in close quarters or aren't too tall, this place is great."
6276572,80866227,2016-06-20,40119710,Erin,"Andrew and Julia's place was great for a weekend stay! The area is really beautiful, quiet, and close to transportation. Many good food and bev options are nearby as well. Andrew and Julia accommodated my late arrival due to a train delay. Super hosts!"
6276572,87927933,2016-07-22,7285359,Patrick,"Andrew's lovely South End Brownstone was the perfect place to relax in the evenings during my business trip.   Everything was exactly as pictured.  Even though you are walking distance for most things in the city, the tree lined streets are surprisingly quiet.  This is 10X better than a hotel.   I recommend the Five Horses Tavern around the corner for some good pub food and brews."
6276572,89650046,2016-07-29,84447901,Mary,"Terrific location.  Very convenient to bus, subway, shopping and restaurants."

13969217,90473908,2016-08-01,82716725,Shan,Overall the place was acceptable and convenient. The price was extremely reasonable. A few problems with amenities and appliances.
13969217,97891525,2016-08-28,78295034,Dana,Not good -- miscommunication with the host unfortunately lead to one of our employees getting kicked out of the apartment due to a reactive situation.
12873559,78170551,2016-06-05,71865807,Dan,Chenkai was an amazing host.  His room was so clean.  Even the bathroom was sparkling.  Grateful to have had such a great experience.

Coordinating our stay with Justine was easy, timely, and professional. The apartment was just as depicted, along with being incredibly organized, clean, and comfortable. I look forward to staying here again on future visits to the city. And I have already recommended the apartment to friends and family."
5004278,37178174,2015-07-05,6240918,Sabrina,"We are so happy that we were able to stay in Justine's lovely apartment. The neighborhood is conveniently located, only short bus ride away from downtown Boston. The roof terrace is stunning, with fantastic views of the Boston skyline. The apartment is very comfortable, well taken care of, and nice and bright. Justine is very accommodating. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Justine's place."

5004278,40751673,2015-08-02,2665657,Sydney,"Justine & Ryan's place was perfect for our weekend needs. Their apartment is clean, airy, well-stocked with kitchen equipment and good books, perfectly situated in the cutest Southie neighborhood, walking distance to lots of shops & cafes (plus a bonafide beach), AND they have two awesome outdoor decks with views of the Boston skyline. They have A/C but we slept with the windows wide open - it was breezy and plenty cool. We would totally consider staying there again next time we have plans in Boston."

I Terrazzi sono meravigliosi e la casa arredata con grande gusto e completa di tutte le dotazioni necessarie. Direi anche più bella delle foto! E' in un quartiere tranquillo ma abbastanza vicino ai locali e molto ben collegato al centro città e ai luoghi di interesse (URL HIDDEN) la consigliamo?ASSOLUTAMENTE SI!!!!"

Everything is as shown in the pictures, clean and comfortable. The decoration of the place is lovely, they have a really great taste and it made us feel like at home. They've been really accessible just in case we needed something. Would repeat again, for sure!"
5004278,44966084,2015-08-30,14925768,Jesse,Justine and Ryan were great. They were very informative of the area and what local places to checkout. The apartment is in a great location.

Her communication was rapid and though she couldn't meet us for check in due to our schedules ... she still made it easy & she was available.  We will stay again.  We will bring our Keurig or coffee maker because I learned I am the worst at making coffee LOL.   Thank you again."
5004278,53878414,2015-11-14,42754783,Kimberly,"My husband and I had a great first time Airbnb experience at Justine's Southie apartment.  Justine was proactive in reaching out a few days before our travel and offered to keep our luggage the morning we arrived so that we could explore the town.  Her and her husband offered lots of suggestions on places to visit.  The apartment itself was perfect for my husband and I. It's walking distance from lots of places to eat and we took nice walks around the neighborhood.  It's just a quick ride from all the major city sites as well.  There is an adorable roof deck that we wish we could have made use of but couldn't due to weather.  Overall, this apartment was the perfect spot for anyone looking for the Boston experience!"

5004278,78231594,2016-06-05,24731539,David,"Justine's apartment is a real gem - it is very clean, cozy and had everything that we needed to get settled in right away (coffee anyone?!). What we enjoyed the most was the spacious rooftop deck where we caught some beautiful views of South Boston.  The neighborhood itself is peaceful at night and safe to walk around at all times of the day. Getting downtown, or in our case Fenway Park, was a breeze - there is an MBTA bus stop a few steps away from the apartment. As a host, Justine is very friendly and easy to contact. We found our itinerary and guidebook to be very informative - all of the major details for our stay were known ahead of our trip (transportation to/from airport, getting around, restaurants, etc.). We definitely recommend staying at Justine's apartment!"

5004278,88420010,2016-07-24,83749810,Keven,"Justine has an absolutely lovely apartment and is an awesome host. She did her best to make us feel comfortable both before and during our stay. The apartment was extremely well kept and the two decks are AMAZING. Awesome view of the city skyline from the roof. The only downside is that the A/C is only in the bedroom, so if it's particularly hot that day the living room can get quite warm. However, this should in no way dissuade anyone from staying here. I don't think we could have found a nicer apartment."
5004278,90319315,2016-07-31,8231816,Donal,Fantastic stay in this great apartment where we felt really at home! Loved the decks and the view was amazing from the upper deck of downtown Boston.

Central to shops and great restaurants, the neighborhood felt safe as well. My favorite part of the listing was the rooftop patio. It has amazing views of the city skyline. Justine was readily available to help with anything we needed. I would recommend to anyone and can't wait to stay again in the future!"
5004278,97775110,2016-08-28,9850742,Pat,"Justine was an excellent host and the apartment was beautiful, clean and organized. The roof deck alone made the trip much more memorable with an excellent view of the city. The neighborhood was great, and it's easy to  walk or get an Uber (which are pretty cheap in Boston) to go wherever you need to go. If you stay here, make sure you walk to the ocean and stroll along the shore to Castle Island!"

Both rooms are nice and clean. Even though I had booked the smal room Mohamed gave me the larger one since I was the only guest at that time. Roslindale is a very nice neighborhood and from the house it is a 3 min walk to the bus station which makes it convenient for those who want to use the public transport.

Mohamed was very accommodating while still giving all his guests their own space. He knows Boston very well and would be a good resource for directions or ideas of how to spend your time in the city. He took me out for dinner at a nice sushi place in Brookline on my last night there, and drove through parts of Boston that I had not seen on the train or bus before. I would definitely stay with him again!"

BTW, he has two lovely granddaughter. The house is really really clean. Mohamed chats with me everyday which makes me feel at home. And he invited me to dinner and when we chatted, he brought me bear which is really good to drink. The area is really quiet but a little far from downtown. But you can take the bus and subway to downtown which is also convenient. The house is really close to the bus stop. Thanks to Mohamed, he made my lonely trip feel not that lonely."

The room is small, but was big enough for me to fit my suitcase and myself comfortably - and it's a good deal for a room in Boston given the price! The house has everything you need and parking, which was important to me."
2583074,90835759,2016-08-02,30495034,Mouna,The experience renting this room for 1-week in July 2016 was great. The host was easy to reach. The room was about what was expected with quiet tenants and calm atmosphere. Clean and well maintained. Highly recommend both the place and the host.

He was a very accommodating host, and was very flexible with a later than expected check in (he even cooked us a delicious dinner!). The room, and infact the the whole house are beautifully decorated and comfortable. It was easy to access public transport to anywhere in Boston, just a short walk to the 'T' station."
"We highly recommend staying with Tobias when you visit Boston. \"",,,,,
1203014,5287666,2013-06-22,6959348,Carri,Tobias has a beautiful house and i loved staying there. In a great neighborhood and peaceful day and night. It was a short 10 min walk to the forest hills station. Very convenient. Tobias is very welcoming. His home is very clean and i enjoyed my stay!
1203014,5358483,2013-06-25,7058516,Milanes,"We had a wonderful experience at Tobias' place. His home is located right in JP, a very short walk away from the train/bus station and with plenty of parking. We inquired about availability the night before and he provided us with a prompt response the following morning! Tobias was very flexible, accessible and his house is beautiful. There was a no-shoe policy (great idea by the way) and he had an entire rack filled with slippers to choose from. His house was very clean and was tucked away from the main street so the noise did not disturb us. The room was small but cozy. We really enjoyed the ceiling fan--it was a nice break from central air-conditioning and the settings were adjustable. The bathroom was also very clean and he provided us with soft towels!"
Will definitely recommend and return in the future :),,,,,

He was very helpful and very acommodating, We sure enjoyed his hospitality and the convenience of his appartment."
1203014,6095545,2013-07-29,391886,Gia,"Tobias keeps a beautiful and conveniently located home in Jamaica Plain.  He was very friendly, helpful, and kind in both his manner and conversation. I look forward to seeing him again sometime in the future. Thanks, Tobias!"

We shared a meal or two and some good conversation and I was able to do some productive work in his quiet, home office setting.

1203014,12157503,2014-04-24,13057904,Axel,"We were very happy that we found Tobias on this website. The room was just like he presented it and the kitchen, where we spent a lot of time, was very well equipped. He had no problem letting us use his stuff. It was always clean and his deck was well put to use during the warm summer days. When it came to transportation we found the Hubway bikes (check it out if you don't know what it is) and the subway to satisfy our needs only a short walk away. Tobias knew a lot about the city itself and was very service-minded when it came to making our stay as comfortable as possible. Its probably not his standard repertoire but he did build an ironing board when there wasn't one to be found and he drove home fixing the internet in a 15 minutes notice after we asked for technical support. Five stars!"
1203014,16427103,2014-07-27,4196684,Simone,"The room and house are exactly as described and pictured, very comfortable and clean. Tobias's self-description is also very accurate - he is a very thoughtful person with strong values interested in many things, a great conversation partner and very easy to get along with.

He helped us a lot with great tips  because we didn't plan that much our week-end, and seemed sincerely pleased to do it and to see us happy. Everything was as described. The room is quiet and comfortable. The house is clean and light comes from 3 directions."
The direct neighborhood is not the most beautiful but close enough from JP centre,T station and parks. A tip : instead of the T,"use Hubway (free service bike rentals) to bike to downtown. You'll see the city a different way and will have a chance to see nice streets and neighborhoods.\"",,,
1203014,17589026,2014-08-14,17235877,Stephen,"\"A great place to stay!  Tobias is a friendly and gracious host who made my wife and I feel very much at home and was generous with his time and in providing neighborhood information.  Everything was easy.  A very pleasant room in an attractive energy-efficient townhouse home anyone would enjoy.  The well-designed \"\"shared bathroom\"\" was really for our own use (Tobias has his own) so no problem there.  The place is a bit off the main drag in JP (Centre Street) but that's not a problem; five minutes by car or three or maybe four times that by foot mostly on very pleasant streets will get you there.  And on the plus side it's within easy walking distance to some great food stops and the last station on the T. I'd very quickly jump at the chance to stay there again. \""
1203014,17796064,2014-08-17,3394450,Winnie,"My husband and I had great time staying in Jamaica Plain with Tobias. We had no problem checking in, in fact we had arrived at our destination earlier on in the day than we intended and he was happy to accommodate us. He was a friendly and generous host and gave some great suggestions for our first time in Boston. The house itself is large, modern, clean and well equipped. While we were too busy to stay around the house during the day, we would have been equally as comfortable hanging out in his large living room or on the sunny deck for breakfast. The bedroom is on the second floor and has a lot of privacy from the common areas of the home along with a comfortable bed for two, a ceiling fan with adjustable settings, and and ironing board ! The bathroom is very clean and new as well. Overall the apartment suited all of our needs and Tobias was a very pleasant host."
The house itself is not on a main street but tucked away in a quieter almost industrial looking area (but free parking out front was a plus). However,it is a VERY short walk to the subway stop that takes you to the downtown crossing in Boston. The Jamaica Plain neighborhood is really cool; during some mornings we didn't mind the stroll up Centre street from the house to grab coffee and breakfast at Fiore bakery followed by a stop a Jamaica Pond (lots of shops and businesses along the way).,,,,
Would recommend this place to anyone who wanted a little bit of quiet,while still having easy access to the downtown area for day trips.,,,,

1203014,18596608,2014-08-28,20042155,Jochen,My wife and i stayed three nights at Tobias' place. The house was absolutely spotless and so was our room and the shared bathroom. The next subway Station (Forest Hills) can be reached in a 5 minute walk. We cannot tell much about the direct neighborhood as we spent most of our time in more central parts of the city. Tobias was a great host. He took at least a couple of minutes any time he saw us and always offered good recommendations for activities and/or food. I would definitely check in there again when i had to stay some nights in Boston. Great place!

We arrived later than estimated time due to traffic jam and Tobias was out.  But he told us the way to enter the house without key in advance to make sure we can self check-in.  We met Tobias eveyday and had very interesting talks.  On the day we departed, Tobias made breakfast for us:) The house is walk-distance to the metro station and it took ~20 minutes to downtown by metro.

He offered to help us with our stuff since there are stairs to take before getting to the room, but we had a small carry-on so we were okay. The room was clean, and the bathroom as well. He gave us a lot of information about things that we can do in Boston, and helped us with the map and metro stations which was so helpful. There's not that much going on around his place as far as restaurants and cafes, but T station is about 10mins walk and that will get you anywhere you want in Boston."

Tobias went above and beyond my expectations of an airbnb host by suggesting things I could do in the city and by loaning me a transit card which was immensely helpful during my trip. I would definitely recommend staying with him!"
1203014,41226619,2015-08-05,18160331,Damien,"Tobias was a fine host. He communicated diligently leading up to our arrival, provided us with everything we needed while there, and offered rich commentary on the city of Boston and his neighborhood of Jamaica Plain."

We didn't spend much time in the house, but it was conveniently located near the T and was a lovely place to land. The kitchen looked well-equipped, there was a cute deck out back, and an incredible book collection upstairs sure to satisfy any reader! Most importantly for us, it was all very very clean and tidy in the bathroom and bedroom. Great place!"

Awesome neighborhood, super convenient to the Orange Line T, and a comfortable and clean place to stay! We were running around quite a bit and only crossed paths a few times, but Tobias was more than friendly, very communicative and helpful with whatever questions we had! Definitely recommended!"
1203014,48008509,2015-09-22,5915304,Chiara,"Excellent stay! Tobias has been very helpful and welcoming. He gave us lots of useful tips and it has been a pleasure to chat with him. The house is beautiful and clean, just like in the pictures. The neighbourhood is quiet and pleasant to walk around. It takes only a few minutes to get downtown (T line is a ten minutes walk from the house) and you can find a large choice of good restaurants and cafes nearby. Totally recommended!"

1203014,51338936,2015-10-19,29224932,Pia,We had a great stay at Tobia's Airbnb
The place was spotlessly clean.,,,,,
Tobia's was very helpful and friendly,,,,,
The location was close to public transportation and a local shopping area,"as long as you did not mind a bit of walking\"",,,,
1203014,52276754,2015-10-27,14289119,Peggy,Staying in Jamaica Plains is a treat and much more cost effective than downtown Boston.
Tobias has a lovely 3 story condo,all hard wood,very neat.  He has a 21 year old cat that is always cuddled up on the sofa.  The cat will meow sometimes because she is deaf,but otherwise keep to herself.,,
The bed is comfortable and not too soft.  The bathroom is extremely clean and the shower head is divine!  There is nothing better than a hot shower with good pressure after a long day of exploring.,,,,,
You are always welcome to use the kitchen,patio,"other parts of the house when you are not exploring.  I would highly recommend renting this space.\"",,,

We also could use the kitchen and living room. You can easily find what you need in the kitchen and cook what you want :)  We recommend you to stay at Tobias' place! You can also see and stroke the sweetest cat in the world Abigal :) And I have to add that Tobias helped us for keeping our luggage after we left the room at noon so that we could get our luggage in the evening."

Neighborhood is quiet, safe and interesting to explore and connect to downtown by T in 10 minutes walking from apartment. We would recommend Chilacates on Armory Street for quick meal and definitely would recommend Tobias apartment to stay. Oh and Abigail is lovely!"
1203014,76076689,2016-05-24,29816132,Ada,Tobias was a very friendly and welcoming host. The space was very clean and the bed was comfortable.  It is about a nine minute walk to the subway. A great place for breakfast or lunch is Canto 6.
1203014,76945605,2016-05-29,70734804,Andrew,"A wonderful first experience with AirBnb. Tobias is a fantastic host and very considerate. He was there to welcome me on my first day and showed me around the house. I didn't need any help from him during my stay because everything was very accessible, but I feel he was always there incase I needed something. The place is only a few minutes from the station and so it is very easy to go to any place in Boston. The neighbourhood is good and safe even for night walks. I would have never wished for a better experience than this."

Plenty of places to eat and sites to see nearby.  Getting around is as easy as it gets for Boston (the T is near, Hubway stations close as well).  Brought my car with me and parking was a breeze.  Would definitely recommend staying at Tobias' for anyone traveling to Boston!"

The house was well-located for public transit, parks & green spaces and I loved the uniqueness of Jamaica Plain. The bedroom/bathroom were great, the kitchen well-resourced and the sundeck absolutely brilliant. I am so grateful to them for their acceptance, support and encouragement of my violin practice throughout my stay and can't thank them enough. And the highlight of my stay would definitely be all the chats I had with them, everything from existential to beyond silly - loved it!"

14426987,93626150,2016-08-13,52801174,Sabrina,"I found this Airbnb last minute for four people and it couldn't have been more perfect. It was super spacious and spotless clean. The rooms were big enough for all of us and the beds were very comfortable. He gave us our own bathroom with a really nice shower head and provided soap and towels for us. Brad was so accommodating and hospitable, we did see real loads of laundry and he cleared plenty of space for us in the kitchen for our food. He was very helpful with getting around by providing us with maps and offering suggestions on what to do. Overall we had a wonderful experience and definitely will stay there again next time we're in Boston."

My son and I really enjoyed staying there and would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an alternative to a hotel stay. We loved our room, private bath and balcony! They even offered a welcome drink, and a complimentary breakfast - what more could you ask for? They have thought of everything and there was absolutely nothing missing."
14426987,97039249,2016-08-25,90530697,Sam,Brad was super accommodating for our whole trip and really went the extra mile to make us feel welcome. The apartment is also in an ideal location and is classy in itself. We will definitely look to book there again if we find ourselves back in Boston.

The location was convenient to Northeastern University where we spent several days and the rooms were newly furnished and very clean and convinient. Our hosts were friendly and conversational without being overbearing. A very positive experience which we would repeat given the opportunity in the future.
4900659,25574285,2015-01-19,17428763,Kara,"This apartment was in a great location. In the heart of Beacon Hill, it was filled with charm and picturesque houses. It was walking distance from Boston Common as well as many stores and restaurants. The apartment was spacious complete with a kitchen, living area, and bedroom. It was well kept and clean. The only concern we had was with the noise of the radiator, but this is something that can come with an older place."
4900659,25782152,2015-01-25,26554882,Klint,The apartment was great and very well kept. Most importantly the location was perfect and within walking distance to the North End. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking to stay in a nice quiet area right in the heart of Boston.

It’s a 15 minute walk from the North End and an easy commute to/from the airport (25 min, with no transfers if you take the Blue Line Train). We never met Alan, but he was very accommodating easy to contact. His instructions for reaching and entering the apartment were thorough and easy to follow."
Note: the apartment is on the third floor. If we hadn’t had a collapsible stroller,we would have had a hard time with the narrow staircases. Also,"the cover photo doesn’t picture the actual address. This is a little confusing when you get there because the actual address does not have any grass out front and is in an older neighborhood.\"",,,
4900659,42315888,2015-08-12,28628785,Dominick,Accurate description. Super easy. Alan was helpful.
4900659,44012788,2015-08-23,4720555,Mark,"This apartment was in a great location in beacon hill right in the middle of things in Boston. Everywhere was in walking distance (apart from Harvard, which is a short subway journey away) and we enjoyed using it as a base to explore boston. There is also a whole foods round the corner, which is always a bonus! The one draw back is that there is no free parking nearby and it is hard even to stop for a short time on the street without getting clamped. If you are coming with a car you have to park in a public garage nearby for about 40 dollars per day (cheaper at weekends), but this was not too much of a problem and is to be expected for such a central apartment. Alan was a great host who responded quickly to our queries."
4900659,44444047,2015-08-26,39142416,Ian,Location was perfect! Walking distance to all of downtown and the subway and the area was beautiful. Check-in time was flexible which worked perfectly for us.
Parking was not available at the apt. so we parked at Alewife station for $15 (9 am to 8 pm next day) which was hardly an inconvenience.,,,,,
Overall great experience: Alan was very helpful and quick to respond,apt. was kept fairly clean,checking in and out was a breeze. The apt. is pretty basic and small,"but a good place to lay your head or cook a quick meal.\"",,

The location of the apartment was wonderful as most of Boston was within walking distance.  Only problem was the temperature was -9 and the wind was about 20 mph so it was a bit brisk to walk around :).

I would be happy to stay again!"
3931204,21806980,2014-10-24,22578523,Steven,"The listing description was accurate, and the place was large and roomy. There were nice touches like a zipper bag with toiletries (soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, soap, etc.) as well as a bag with coffee, tea and even microwave popcorn. The neighborhood is very convenient to lots of restaurants, the Museum of Science, TD Gardens is 2 blocks away, as is the metro/train station. The building was nice, quiet and having a doorman was very convenient for things like calling cabs, recommending restaurants, etc. I didn't use the laundry, exercise room or pool, but was nice to know they were there if I wanted. I would definitely stay in this property next time I'm in Boston."
3931204,22771022,2014-11-14,294273,Yousef,"This place's listing was very accurate and the apartment was just perfect for us. You have a convenient store down the building with some fast food restaurants and CVS/pharmacy next to WhoolFoods within a 5 minute walk, which was very convenient and prompting to us."
Another good reason to stay here is the proximity of the North Station,which I always used for commuting to MIT.,,,,
Heskel was great and always responded positively and was kind enough even to extend our stay when I requested a 1 day extension.,,,,,

13514017,84308492,2016-07-06,29744304,Jester,Beautiful unit in Boston pier. Unit is big enough for 5 people. Very new and modern. Terrace at the top was perfect to view the city.
Building is a bit of a walk from the Boston attractions but steps away from the Court House station of Silver Line which connects to the  South Station of the Red Line.,,,,,
Only issue was they provided only 3 towels when we were 5. Not a big one because others had the foresight to bring towels. So I suggest you remind the owner if you're booking. Suggest owner to supply paper towels as wells so you can wipe the kitchen when people use it.,,,,,
Will book again if I go back to the city.,,,,,

"Only minor complaint was the building ran out of toilet paper on Sunday night.  Too funny but it was all OK by Monday morning!\"",,,,,
13514017,89222147,2016-07-27,83356823,Evan,"Arrival at the building went smoothly, our stay was very comfortable.  Gabe's place is well appointed and in a great location - we walked about 15 minutes to several hot spots downtown."
13514017,90648299,2016-08-01,15384074,Andy,"Gabe's apartment is great. Amazing views of Boston, and the rooftop is a fantastic place to take in a sunset. Check-in/out with the concierge was a breeze. Location is short walk from old Boston, but with plenty of bars/restaurants nearby in the neighborhood as well."
13514017,91375734,2016-08-05,78717878,Andrew,Gabe was communicative. Conversations with the concierge pointed out that Gabe has an arrangement to rent out units. I got the impression that the building is not at full occupancy and so apartments were being shown. The unit is rather spartan.
The unit is one of many in wholly rental building. The penthouse floors are on the top three floors. Our apartment was on the 15th floor and had a skyline-view of new buildings up and a little of downtown.,,,,,
Gabe/host needs to think about how people will use the space. It needs a (i) toaster,(ii) pot holders,(iii) shampoo and soap is single dispense (similar to hotel),(iv) bed linens are needed if you are going to sleep 6 (sofa lies flat),(v) there are not enough towels. If I owned the place then I would add a few more things to make it look like it was owned by a person rather than a business entity. A few $10 towels and soap dishes,more artwork on the wall
"It is very convenient to the Silver Line for the airport. Access the MBTA is straight forward and it is about a mile walk to Fanueil Hall area/North End.\"",,,,,
13514017,92491753,2016-08-08,7764024,Monica,"Great stay! You will not be disappointed! The accommodation was exactly as described and very new, in fact we felt like the first guests to stay there.  The location is not quite in the city CBD but we had a car so did not bother us and it looked fairly easy to get around by foot, Uber or I'm sure trains were nearby.  The facilities at the unit complex were fabulous and we made use of the rooftop deck. There appeared to be a number of bars and restaurants within walking distance.  Street parking was easy to find, be careful if you park in one of the garages as we got stung that their day starts at 5am which means you think you're paying $15 overnight but when you go to get your car out in the morning they sting you for an additional day as you've gone past 5.00am.  Great place to stay if you want a bit more room, laundry and a great kitchen."
13514017,93879507,2016-08-14,9029952,Hengameh,"This is a lovely, modern apartment in a beautiful, newer building in a wonderful location.  The two bedrooms are comfortable and attractive, although closet space is at a premium.  The main living area has a stupendous view of downtown Boston.  It is furnished with two leather futons that are comfortable for sitting and would be acceptable for sleeping for children or teens.  The kitchen is divided from the living area by a combined work area/breakfast nook.  The nook has seating for two; there is no dining table.  The building is ultra-modern, with lovely amenities.   Do find the fabulous coffee maker in the spacious and attractive second floor lounge.  The rooftop terrace has astonishing views of downtown and is very nicely-furnished.  Seaport is a fast-developing neighborhood for young professionals with many good restaurants and some charming streets; there is a great deal of construction ongoing, but we did not find it bothersome.  There is no supermarket within walking distance, but a limited supply of grocery items are available at local bakeries/sandwich shops.  Downtown Boston is easily reached by foot.  We took Uber everywhere for longer trips and had no problem finding rides.  The apartment has a corporate feel to it, which is fine; we never met the host, but the building's concierges were helpful and accommodating.  It was spotlessly clean, but, for example, some might prefer to have the previous occupant's leftover cooking oil and salt and pepper at hand.  The price was eminently reasonable.   Boston is an exceptional city and this apartment was perfect for our family of four."
13514017,95498994,2016-08-20,65206825,Thomas,The Location is amazing. Rooftop with BBQ and Breathtaking View. Appartement was excellent. Gabe a caring and pleasant Host. Thanks for a Wanderführer Stau. We will come back.
13514017,97231224,2016-08-26,1948925,Richard,"If you're looking for an alternative to staying at a hotel in downtown Boston, this is a reasonable option. The location is great, everything is within walking distance, and the neighborhood has many options for meals and entertainment."
While the building is beautiful,"the apartment is impersonal and has the feel of \"\"just enough\"\" comfort and amenities to rent out. It was fine for 2 business travelers",but probably not great for groups or families.,,,
It sounds like our experience was out of the norm,but communication from the host was poor regarding check-in. We were given the wrong keys by the person at the front desk (and walked into an occupied apartment,surprising everyone). We tried to reach Gabe via calls and messages,neither were returned. We simply had to assume that we ended up in the right apartment since he only responded to us regarding checking out 2 days later.,,

Elizabeth was very accommodating of my late check-in, and she was quick, clear, and helpful in all our communication."
4065578,20453007,2014-09-29,422845,Paul,"Elizabeth was a great host, the apartment was perfect for my parents while they were visiting and in a great location. I would definitely recommend staying there again."
4065578,20667526,2014-10-03,21603736,Vicente,We stay at Elizabeth's place for 3 nights in October 2014.
The apartment is really a great place to stay.,,,,,
Lovely decorated and extremely well located. Very close to Back Bay station if you come by train,and close also to the subway and just a nice walk from the city center.,,,,
I would say that is better that what you appreciate in the pictures,,,,,
Also the bed is very confortable.,,,,,
"So really it was an optimal choice for us.\"",,,,,
4065578,20982761,2014-10-08,22059112,Julia,"Elizabeth is a great host. Even though I didn't manage it to meet her in person, everything worked out fine. She answered my 1000 questions quickly and gave us some nice restaurant tips."
"The apartment is very cute. It's small and clean and just around the corner from many sightseeing places. \"",,,,,
4065578,21147637,2014-10-12,8127681,Tommy,Had a great time at Elizabeth's apartment. Was there on business and it was perfectly located in Back Bay with only a 5 minute walk to where we need to be. Really easy to walk most places from where it is. Elizabeth was a great host and the apartment is lovely. I would recommend.
4065578,21475709,2014-10-18,14067034,Mark,"I stayed at Elizabeth's place for 4 nights while attending a conference at the Hynes Convention Center. This apt is ideally located for such a business trip and very convenient to Copley and Back Bay. The apt is clean, comfortable and cozy. Elizabeth was prompt in all communication and accommodating. I will certainly look to stay here again on future trips to Boston!"
4065578,22700928,2014-11-12,22081115,Alvin,"Fantastic location within Back Bay and perfect for travellers to conferences at the Hynes Convention Centre. Immaculate, clean apartment with all necessary furnishings. Elizabeth was incredibly easy to contact with questions, and certainly very accommodating with my very late check in hours! A must stay option, you won't be disappointed."
4065578,23015095,2014-11-20,23224103,Heidi,Elizabeth was wonderfully welcoming and accommodating.
This was my first experience with Airbnb; it was superb.  Elizabeth's place was as pictured. Neighborhood was close to everything a true Boston experience could offer; Prudential,Copley,food stores,public gardens,Charles River,Newbury St
I ran into two hiccups while staying at Elizabeth's place - super minor,but I must saying Elizabeth's hosting was superiour; she provided quick response and attention to the matters!,,,,
"GO!\"",,,,,
4065578,27912688,2015-03-14,28011257,Cindy,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4065578,28600594,2015-03-27,26501001,Jacqueline,"On arrival to Boston, the host was very good in responding to texts for various needs during the visit. It helped a lot. Before the flight, I was a little worried because I was not able to contact the host until 3 days before my schedule check-in to confirm. The place is very representative of the pictures presented on airbnb. The location is great, many shops and restaurants and a nearby grocery, which is a short walk away."
4065578,29709938,2015-04-11,30709885,Michelle,"Elizabeth was a great host, who was very quick to respond to my initial inquiry and all other interactions.  The ease of dealing with Elizabeth made this experience great. Her apartment is very nice, clean and in an awesome location.  It is on the second floor of a walk up and is facing the alleyway.  It is very quiet.  Apartment is right across from the Prudential Center, so there are plenty of shops, restaurants and a food store.  There is laundry in the building (.75 per load) which was very useful as we stayed for 5 nights.  It was cold and rainy/snowy while we were there so the apt was not hot, but the small space heater provided worked wonders.  We had an issue with the wireless, but once I contacted Elizabeth, she worked with the cable company to resolve the issue and it was fixed in a matter of hours.  One thing - there are not many TV stations as she has basic cable, but she does have Netflix.  I will definitely stay in this apartment on my next trip to Boston. It is so much better than a hotel."
4065578,30373637,2015-04-21,17119269,Pete,"This was our first experience with Airbnb - any apprehensions were soon dismissed with Elizabeth's quick responses to our questions and a gracious and thoughtful welcome upon our arrival. It's a great location near the Prudential Center, close to a grocery store and to some great restaurants that Elizabeth recommended. For being so close to a busy part of the city, the apartment is very quiet. The photos on Airbnb do represent the place - clean, comfortable and casual."
4065578,32104231,2015-05-14,27109409,Jasmin,"This appartment was absolutely lovely. Location is really good, nice shops, cafes and restaurants nearby and the metro was really close also. Elisabeth was really helpful and answered quickly to all of our questions. We don't have anything to complain."
4065578,32168654,2015-05-15,29500911,Merry,Great location. Great apt. Great shower. 100% would rent again.
4065578,32672074,2015-05-20,25194494,Carly,"Had a great time staying in Elizabeth's apartment. The location is fantastic - just a short walk to Newbury Street yet in a very quiet street. Unfortunately, Elizabeth was slow to respond to messages leading up to our stay but once we arrived she responded to text messages very promptly. All in all a great airbnb experience."
4065578,33219313,2015-05-26,8270407,Marcel,"Die Wohnung von Elizabeth ist sehr zentral gelegen in Nähe zu Subway-Stationen, dem Stadtzentrum und Shopping-Möglichkeiten. Als Ausschattung in der Wohnung ist alles vorhanden was man braucht und zudem war alles in sehr ordentlichem und sauberem Zustand. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr ruhig und angenehm zu besuchen, auch zu nächtlichen Zeiten."
Die Ankunft war überaus leicht gemacht und hat bestens funktioniert. Vielen Dank an Elizabeth,"dass wir in Ihrem Apartment nächtigen durften -> höchste Bewertung an Elizabeth! Gerne kommen wir wieder!\"",,,,
4065578,33504665,2015-05-29,23548551,Shasha,"I loved staying at this casual and comfortable Copley home! The apartment was spacious, clean, and convenient. It included a coffee machine, plenty of kitchen supplies  for longer stays, as well as central heat & AC. It was located in one of the most scenic neighborhoods in Boston and close to delicious restaurants, including The Salty Pig and Myers & Chang. The host, Elizabeth was the best! When I accidentally locked myself out of the apartment at 10:30 pm, she helped to ensure I could get in even though she was traveling and it was late at night. Great experience!"

4065578,39152848,2015-07-21,4531629,Melissa,"Elizabeth's place was perfect for our trip to Boston. The location was great, close to great restaurants and shops. I love walking around and exploring so was happy to discover that different neighbourhoods were within a 15 min walk from Elizabeth's and when we wanted to venture further, train stations are just a short walk away."
The apartment has everything you would need. It's very clean and comfortable. There wasn't anything we needed that wasn't there. I didn't need to communicate with Elizabeth much but when I did,"she responded in a timely matter. She was away during our time there but her assistant was very friendly and and helpful. I would recommend Elizabeth's place.  \"",,,,

The apartment was clean, very nice decor and had everything you would get at a hotel.  Elizabeth gave us all the information we needed to check in and the check in was very easy.  I would highly recomend this property, a great value and I would plan to stay again if I find myself back in Boston."

4065578,49302707,2015-10-02,941960,Jo-An,Cute pied-a-terre which is extremely well maintained and located in the center of Boston. We were pleased it was so close to the convention center. Thanks to Elizabeth the checkin process was seamless.

This apartment is close to everything in Back Bay (and pretty much all of the other tourist-loved spots in Boston), and it is clean and quiet.

4065578,50035564,2015-10-08,332826,Faye & John,"This is a very nice apartment in the heart of Boston, near the Prudential Center, tons of shops. It's a great area to walk around and, importantly, an easy walk from the Back Bay station. We flew into Logan, hopped the shuttle to the Blue Line and, with one change (to Orange) we were at Back Bay."
The apartment has a really nice bedroom,"kitchen and bathroom. It's very comfortable.\"",,,,

Elizabeth provided us with all the information we needed for our stay and gaining access to the apartment was very smooth. Communication prior to our stay was limited but this appeared to be due to some technical problems, and Elizabeth got in touch quickly once the issue had been noticed. All in all a great base for a Boston stay!"
4065578,51108330,2015-10-18,27921245,Cindy,It was a very good experience.  The apartment is just as described and it's in a very convenient location.  Elizabeth was very easy to work with and her check in/check out instructions were very easy.  Would definitely stay her again.  Thanks Elizabeth!

Lovely apartment and location"
4065578,57884212,2015-12-30,46425214,Amber,"The house was very comfortable. It was close to everywhere I wanted to go and only 20 mins away from the airport. I thought the house was a little bit small at first, but it is perfect for 1-2 people."
4065578,60335987,2016-01-22,3882704,Paul,"This was my second stay in Elizabeth's apartment.  The check in process was efficient and seamless and the apartment very well appointed and comfortable.  A cosy retreat from the Boston January chill!  Terrific location, close to Copley and Back Bay.  Short walk to Back Bay station and 10 mins by car to Logan.  I couldn't fault Elizabeth or the apartment.  I wouldn't hesitate recommending this as a wonderful place to stay in Boston"
4065578,62479504,2016-02-14,58505959,Oliver,"Very clean, loved the all white interior, it was exactly what I was looking for during my stay!"
Only negative was that the heat doesn't work properly,so just a heads up for that issue if you are coming here during the winter. However,she does have a space heater which works well,"as well as an additional heater in the bathroom which works as well.\"",,
4065578,65074245,2016-03-10,30777982,Andy,"Everything was quick and easy.  Elizabeth sent detailed instructions on how to get into the apt and once there, there were no surprises.  The apt is cozy but comfortable.  It was a block away from the Prudential Center and Copley Place, which made getting to and from transport as easy as could be."
4065578,65979500,2016-03-18,1866259,Katja,"Great place and location! The well-appointed, cozy apartment is exactly as described in the listing. It could not be located better, whether you are in Boston for business and pleasure it is a walk or short taxi/T ride away from shopping, food, tourist attractions etc. Despite its central location it is quiet - a little oasis after a day of working or exploring. I highly recommend this place and Elizabeth was great - perfect information flow,  everything was thought off and proactively communicated."
4065578,68067033,2016-04-02,13572608,Elizabeth,"The location of this apartment was amazing. Very central, literally steps to prudential centre, trader joes and many restaurants and amenities. It was near to the prudential train station as well, which made transportation a breeze. The apartment itself was very clean and well kept. It was more than enough space for three people to sleep comfortably. The space was tastefully decorated and we thoroughly enjoyed our short stay here. Elizabeth was well-organised and ensured we had everything we needed for our trip. She gives you the independence to explore Boston at your own pace but is ready with recommendations if needed."
4065578,68938248,2016-04-07,15192071,Michael,"Elizabeth's place was perfect for my quick trip to a conference at Hynes. The unit was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood had great access to food, transportation, etc. Elizabeth was a great host. Truly no issues to speak of."
4065578,69959670,2016-04-15,27870011,Ajay,"This is clearly the worst. No one meets up, emails, messages phone calls are unanswered. the entire apartment is occupied by her personal things so no storage [sit on floor and take out ur clothes from suitcases] . the apartment has poor maintenance viz moody shower, broken handrails,barely hanging flush handle, difficult to switch on dishwasher and less said about the laundry room the better. the apartment does not have a basic thing like a toaster !! the hostess [??] is clearly there to make money and wants to extract as much more  on any pretext or other which thank fully AirBnB overruled. Clearly a place to avoid if you are there for more than a day."
4065578,70677604,2016-04-19,17119269,Pete,"Location, location. Can't beat Elizabeth's apartment. Close to every thing you need when you're in the big city on a budget."
4065578,73957205,2016-05-11,7637723,Jon,"What a great place to stay! Elizabeth makes visitors feel very welcome and at home in this wonderful Back Bay apartment. Location is just perfect - very close to a few Green and Orange Line T stations and the Back Bay Amtrak stop. Very quiet neighbourhood, building has everything you'd need (including laundry facilities), and the apartment is exactly as described, including the very easy to use and well equipped kitchen, and a very comfortable bed. Highly recommend this property for both first timers to Boston and regular visitors. We will definitely stay here on out next visit."
4065578,75838887,2016-05-23,19586242,Kristin,"Checking into Elizabeth's apartment couldn't have been more convenient! The space was very clean and even offered cable and Netflix! Plus the location is tough to beat- we walked to most major attractions in about 10 minutes, and the stadium in about 15-20. Elizabeth was quick to answer our messages, making the trip totally stress-free."
4065578,76956303,2016-05-30,6949137,Nick,Great apartment! Easy check-in and very clean. Thank you Elizabeth!

It's clean, comfy and the location is great, close to public transport (though I prefer walking - you can walk up to the Public Garden in about 20mins) and having the Star Market across the road was super handy. Was easy to find and access and it was great to be able to leave my bags in the basement on checkout day as my flight was late at night. Would definitely stay again if I ever returned to Boston."

4065578,81542402,2016-06-23,573549,Jessica,"What a great place. I stayed with my husband and there was plenty of room for both of us. We had plenty of room to put all our stuff away and hang it up too. Bed as comfortable and the shower was great too. The location is fantastic and you can walk to most places, if you want to go further afield you are really close to a number of subway stations. It's in a quiet location despite being close to everything. Elisabeth was really helpful and responsive to any questions during our stay and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her apartment, in fact I would like to come back again!"
4065578,84178181,2016-07-05,27546053,Sergio,"Elizabeth was an amazing hostess and her place in Back Bay was quite perfect. Elizabeth was very prompt and courteous in answering any messages I would send. The apartment is a spacious one bedroom in a very convenient location. It's near the Green Line and Orange Line and is across from the shopping and food options at The Prudential. The A/C works very well in the hot and humid summer, keeping the place cool and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again."

We stayed when the weather was in the 90s and the air conditioning was excellent. We were the for vacation but I did have to do some work remotely while there. The wifi was strong and never faltered. I can't recommend Liz's place enough!"
4065578,88135586,2016-07-23,54844723,Santiago,Great place! I enjoyed it very much. I need to warn about parking and going with kids. But everything was perfect.

I had one problem with the tv, which didn't really get resolved, but I can say I didn't spend much time wanting to watch; so much sight-seeing, shopping and eating at the perfect location to get around from."
4065578,91718077,2016-08-06,7146246,Lindsey,Great place! Perfect if you want to be close to it all. Directions are easy to follow and communication was a breeze. Very clean and nice to come home to at the end of a long day.

The location was close to public transport and was very easy to use to get to downtown Boston.  He was very welcoming and hospitable and I'd honestly love to stay here again in the future."
4638356,80040797,2016-06-15,28408393,Jaden,Andrey and his wife were great at helping us with a last minute request. They were most helpful with our late arrival and we had a nice breakfast and conversation the next morning before catching our flight out. The Mexican joint next door has a great staff and food too. I might add that the place is really clean.
4638356,81173487,2016-06-21,76808973,James,"Andrey and Olayh were wonderful hosts. Couldn't ask for better! The house was clean and access to transit was nearby. Parking may be an issue however if you park on Lexington street in front of the school, you should be okay. Alternatively, there is parking at the airport which is nearby. Excellent and very generous hosts... you will not be disappointed."
4638356,81308453,2016-06-22,75620655,Kalin,Host made us feel welcome and as accommodating. He spot we exactly as listed and the neighborhood was a 5-7 min walk to the train station which was very convenient ! We had a great time

4638356,82780105,2016-06-29,1311416,Deep,Andrey was very communicative right from the start and his friend Dani was a great help when Andrey was out of town. It is really useful location and good value for an airport layover.

I would totally recommend this host!"

They're both very friendly, nice and approachable and even cooked us breakfast and provided a glass of wine some nights to make us feel welcome. They provided advice on where and what to see, giving us some local tips which help us so much. The house is very close to the train station and airport which made public transport accessible, the grocery and pharmacy are a 5 min walk and there is a fantastic Mexican restaurant just on the corner of their street. I would definitely recommend their Airbnb if you are in the area. Thank you again Andrey and Olya we really appreciated your hospitality during our stay :)"
4638356,86329365,2016-07-16,75864411,Claudio,"The room was big and clean with a comfortable bed. Everything was ready for my arrival. There were clean towels and a bed with clean sheets. The overall apartment was very clean and comfortable. The position is also god. About 5/10 minutes walking from the subway station of the airport. I spent there just one night before my next flight. However, I would say that Andrey's place may be good also for someone who wants to stay longer, since from the subway station, which is very close, it is very easy to get to the city center. Furthermore, Andrey is a very nice person. Talkative and kind."
4638356,86666917,2016-07-17,81591289,Daniel,"My stay in East Boston was just over night and booked only three days in advance. I was too late and Andrey was not at home when i got there so i saw them just in the morning before i left but i got the keys anyways. It was easy to get to the keys with the description Andrey sent me, the room was clean and quiet.  The host and his wife are both really nice and they were able to recommend me some stuff i was searching for. To sum up, everything was as described and as expected. Both hosts are communicative and really helpful so i can only tell positive stuff."
4638356,86712469,2016-07-17,18200414,Florian,Andrey's girlfriend welcomed me when I arrived. She offered me a cold bottle of water and showed me around. She was very friendly and welcoming. The house is very clean and nice and quite close to the airport as well as the train station. Can definitely recommend the place.
4638356,87516319,2016-07-20,64503526,Bryan,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was positive. The host responded promptly to my request for a reservation, and when I arrived in town, the hostess welcomed me and showed me around their home in a friendly and professional way.  The facilities were basic but comfortable, and as advertised.  I would not hesitate to return there."
4638356,87692803,2016-07-21,11222333,Tanya,"This was my first AirBnB experience, and it couldn't have been a better start."
The room is exactly as described - lovely,spacious and there was also a detailed manual with heaps of useful info.,,,,
A super quick train ride from Logan Airport,then a short walk from the station,it's perfect for pre and post flights.,,,
Plus,it's a really friendly neighbourhood,close to tasty restaurants and essential shops -  handy,as my luggage didn't arrive with me in Boston!,,
From the second I booked to when I arrived Andrey and Olya were amazing,quick to answer any questions by text and email.,,,,
Olya was amazing helping me plan my onward journey,and even text to check I arrived safe and sound. She also sent me packing with coffee,fresh fruit and a cereal bar.,,,
I can't recommend staying here enough.,,,,,
"Thank you both so much.\"",,,,,
4638356,88127059,2016-07-23,79284979,Erin,"My husband and I stayed with Andrey overnight while exploring Boston. Andrey is friendly, the house is clean and welcoming, and the location is great. Excellent experience!"
4638356,88629135,2016-07-25,85070109,Nathan,"I was welcomed by Andrey and his wife. The room was great and exactly what I was after. Comfortable bed, clean and friendly. The only thing was the street outside. It didn't always feel that safe. Nevertheless, the room is what I was after and it was right by the airport station making it extremely accessible and practical. Thank you both for your welcome."
4638356,89033963,2016-07-26,20134589,James,"Andrey and Olya were wonderful hosts and made my short stay a great experience. Not only was this a great location that I could walk to from Logan airport, but I was greeted with something to eat, a glass of wine, and very enjoyable company. It is a lovely home, very clean, spacious and comfortable. I would highly recommend staying with Andrey."

Melissa is a very kind person. I moved to Boston for 1 year and I stayed with her while I was searching for an apartment. She helped me a lot with advices and to overcome my homesick. We went out together and I knew some of her friends. Everyone was very nice with me.,,,,,
The house is spacious and very near to the subway and to a lot of groceries,restaurants,etc.. And JP is a very nice place,I had no problem in coming home late or similar.,,
"\"",,,,,
5049582,31707916,2015-05-09,8224290,Rory & Tatiana,My wife and I had a great time in Boston while staying in Melissa's home. We loved the room we stayed in and also her entire place. And the location of her home was excellent. Just a short walk from the metro station and also an even shorter walk to bars and restaurants. Such a cool neighborhood! Sam Adams brewery is just a ten minute walk too!
All in all,"Melissa is an exceptional host and really cares about her guests. I'd highly recommend her to future travelers and would stay again:)\"",,,,
5049582,33442487,2015-05-28,30671023,Sivan,This was my first airbnb experience and no doubt that could not be better! Melissa was a fantastic host. She invited me to some great parties with really nice people from JP!!
"The room was really like in the pictures and all entire home was awesome.\"",,,,,
5049582,43703608,2015-08-21,37052674,Preston,"Melissa was remarkably accommodating and helpful throughout the entire process. Even though she was on vacation during my stay, she ensured that I had everything I needed through her roommate. The space itself matched the online listing and was a comfortable room in a prime location."
5049582,64354300,2016-03-03,48426155,Ana,"Mélissa is the best! I felt like home, back in Boston. She and her friends are awesome! And I will not Forget the sweat Acacia! The room has exactly like in the picture! The neighborhound calme and frendly. The train orange line near by, which by far is the best t line in Boston."
So,"go to Melissa superhost superhouse!\"",,,,
5049582,84708683,2016-07-08,48485495,Min Li,"I stayed at Melissa's place for 2 months when I was in Boston for research, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay there. Melissa is the most wonderful Airbnb host one could ever ask for, and she truly took pains to make sure everything was comfortable and fine for me from the moment I settled in. Melissa's place is clean, quaint and very cosy. Jamaica Plain is a very safe and wonderful neighbourhood to be in with lots of interesting shops a short walk away. I particularly liked how I could cycle to the Longwood Medical Area via the SW Corridor Park. The Green Street T stop was also a short 3 min walk or so away from the apartment, which made it really easy for me to get around places."
5049582,94310363,2016-08-15,33292147,Laura,"Melissa made me feel right at home in a very relaxed way. She was friendly, helpful, full of information and tips without being intrusive.  I was  out and about a fair amount, and yet, both Melissa and Acacia made me feel welcome at every turn.  I would stay here again in an instant!"
5049582,97474097,2016-08-27,16260894,Taylor,"I had a great stay with Melissa! The room was exactly as pictured, and the neighborhood was great with easy access to multiple amenities via walking or public transportation. Melissa was a fun host and very welcoming and accommodating. Of course, Acacia the lab also won me over right away and made me miss my pups back home less."
14713980,96653443,2016-08-23,91380829,Lindsay,The host canceled this reservation 85 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1051482,4684340,2013-05-20,3502134,Erin,"Ryan was amazing in every way! - generous, attentive, friendly. The boats were amazing - clean, well appointed, convenient. I would happily return!"
1051482,8376597,2013-10-28,2898931,Kyle,"The houseboat itself is awesome and Ryan was a great host in coordinating everything with me. The place is spacious and feels brand new inside. The dock is really calm, and unless the wind picks up, you can hardly feel that you're on the water. The sunrise visible from the master bedroom was consistently beautiful too, and made up for the fact that there wasn't a view of downtown Boston from where it is docked."
The biggest downside though,is that East Boston is kind of up and coming,and most of the activities will require going into downtown Boston. Getting there requires a bit of a walk to the nearest subway stop or an expensive taxi ride,which I would recommend taking at night.,,
One more thing worth mentioning is that the airport is nearby and sometimes the planes overhead are pretty loud,though I never lost sleep because of it.,,,,
All things considered,I was very pleased with my decision to stay here and would recommend it to friends.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1051482,8945536,2013-11-27,11179,Barbara,"Ryan met us promptly at the dock. Mother Nature threw us a huge curveball with high gusts and wind chill!! He did everything he could to be sure we were safely aboard including adjusting the heat and providing a space heater if needed! We were cozy and weathered the storm well.  The houseboat was immaculately clean and stocked bedding, linens and with coffee, condiments and toiletries as promised. We used  the water taxi service which was just as advertised. It was fun adventure!"
1051482,15710134,2014-07-14,17266254,Guillaume,"Awesome place, great host"

1051482,18913391,2014-09-02,7116133,Kate,Pros:
Free parking,,,,,
Free water taxi into and out of the city (we would take it in and then cab back to the boat at night),,,,,
Intimate space for bonding,,,,,
Clean,,,,,
Ryan was very responsive and helpful.,,,,,
Quiet beautiful mornings,,,,,
Cons,,,,,
The boat was a little lopsided,though didn't bother us much.,,,,
Flushing of the toilet was a little bit stinky.,,,,,
Overall we loved it. We were either in Boston or beach side during the day. But mornings were lovely,"and nights were great for board games (would rec bringing some!) Would definitely recommend for a fun chill weekend get together. \"",,,,
1051482,19234856,2014-09-08,17787180,William,Experience was great. Mariana is gated and safe. Exactly what my crew needed.
1051482,21288932,2014-10-14,9653082,Leroy,"The best experience ever! Ryan was so helpful and always available to assist. He was very welcoming and approachable! The neighborhood was quiet and very friendly. It's in a convenient location- bus, train, gas station, grocery store, clothing store, liquor store, everything is in walking distance! The boat was equipped with everything I needed and even some convenient surprises. I didn't want to leave. This made my boston experience. Now back to normal life on land :("
1051482,21662362,2014-10-21,21058486,Nathan,"Great experience, the place to stay that made the trip even more memorable!  Everything was as described and Ryan was very accommodating with check in/out times. Hope to make it back one day!"
1051482,21945542,2014-10-27,20330281,Craig,Everything was in place when we arrived. Smoke alarms had low batteries but they were tended to immediately. I was renting a house boat for the first time and was a bit nervous but it turned out to be a very pleasant experience. It was actually intriguing to watch the channel traffic thru the draw bridge.
"Our host came thru with everything that was promised. Definitely recommend as an alternative to high price hotels in downtown Boston.\"",,,,,
1051482,31688342,2015-05-08,32918134,Mary,The reservation was canceled 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1051482,34932670,2015-06-14,5933628,Jenny,"We enjoyed the experience of staying on a houseboat. Ryan was a bit late to meet us when we arrived, but otherwise the communication was good."
The boat is also in an industrial area and directly under the flight path so is pretty noisy.,,,,,
But there were lots of great restaurants between the Marina and the train station,which is less than 10 mins walk away.,,,,
One thing - there was no functioning wifi on the boat. The only available was a shared wifi for the whole Marina and it was very very poor,"often cutting out after several minutes without a single page loaded. This is not the place to stay if you are an international traveller reliant on wifi to find out where to go or how to get around. \"",,,,
1051482,46220229,2015-09-08,6280071,Mélanie,Everything went well. The boat is in a calm neighborhood and near all the things you would want to see while in Boston. We even had the chance to see the Labor Day fireworks from the marina. Everything was very clean and Ryan has been helpful.
1051482,49185756,2015-10-01,16190778,Shantell,"\"Ryan's place is TOP NOTCH. I wasn't too sure about staying on a house boat, but my husband said \"\"be a little adventurous\"\""
"The place is exactly as described and even better. There were so many \"\"small touches\"\" that put this place over the top.",,,,,
Our arrival was easy. Ryan's friends Diego met us and showed us around the boat,he also gave us his number if we needed him for anything else.,,,,
"The boat was unbelievably cozy and comfortable. My 2 teenage daughters loved the loft space where they slept. And the master bedroom was not only comfortable but decorated very tastefully. My husband found a hideaway bed in the living room couch and said \"\"nice","we can bring the twins (our daughters in college) next time and stay here again\"\".",,,,
This was the 10th AirBnB we've stayed in from New York(3x's),Philadelphia(2x's) Paris(2x's) Rome,Honolulu and now (URL HIDDEN) far its our favorite. Like i mentioned earlier,it was the small things that were provided that we loved:,,
-Shampoo,,,,,
-Conditioner,,,,,
-Body Wash,,,,,
-Wash Cloths,,,,,
-Coffee Maker (with coffee,cream & sugar),,,,
-Iron (with bed top ironing board),,,,,
-Ample Electrical outlets,,,,,
-Detailed instructions on check-out,,,,,
-FREE Water Taxi Service,,,,,
-FREE dedicated parking area,,,,,
I couldn't believe that the two previous AirBnB's we stayed in didn't provide a wash cloth,which could be why i was so excited to find a whole stack in Ryan's place.,,,,
Lastly,the VALUE on the FREE parking & FREE Water Taxi Service shouldn't go un-noticed. We had just came from New York where we paid $50 for 3 hours,so this was something we were hyper aware of. Then to have the Water Taxi pick us up literally at our front door and be FREE,is a total god-send. I saw other passengers who weren't staying on any of Ryan's boats paying $20/(URL HIDDEN) that cost,I easily saved $160 on my family of 4 that utilized 2 roundtrips. Yaaaaaay!,
All in all,we look forward to our return to Boston,mostly for the chance to stay on any one of Ryan's houseboats. Cheers...job well-done!,,,

1051482,52663800,2015-10-31,39120095,Chris,Ryan did an excellent job all around. Business plans changed on my end which brought me into town late a night early and Ryan responded promptly setting us up with a place. I informed him we would be arriving late that night so he stopped by the place prior and turned on the heat and lights for us.
Location was convenient - close to subway,downtown,and airport (which is a nice feature when having the 5:15am flight!),,,
All-in-all,"excellent accommodations for our trip. \"",,,,
1051482,58845048,2016-01-05,48440427,Shenshen,We had a great experience staying at Ryan's boathouse. Ryan asked his manager to welcome us and gave us a nice introduction. The heating system was awesome so we felt comfortable even though it was super cold outside. The location's convenient if you want to visit Harvard or MIT. And it takes like less than 20mins driving to Boston downtown. Definitely nice place to stay.
1051482,70626034,2016-04-19,69503,Neal,The Andromeda was great. 6 of us traveled to Boston to run the Boston Marathon and wanted to experience the city in a unique way....and this houseboat provided the perfect amount of uniqueness! The boat is very clean and surprisingly spacious. Ryan was incredibly responsive and easy to work with. The check in and check out process was very smooth. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and would certainly recommend it to others traveling to Boston.
1051482,83724064,2016-07-04,42282558,Ron,"Awesome experience! Making me reconsider future travel plans because we enjoyed it so much! We'll be looking for houseboats wherever we travel and will likely try the property in Fort Lauderdale at some point. Our only gripe would be the view, could be nicer if not so industrial."
1051482,85290792,2016-07-11,78041545,Ginger,There was someone waiting when we arrived to let us in and show is around. He carefully answered all our questions then left us to enjoy our time. We really enjoyed this cozy space. Being on the water was beautiful. The people living nearby were very friendly. It was nice to be able to park my car and just use Uber to get around. It was easily accessable to downtown and the waterfront area. We loved staying here!
1051482,86919260,2016-07-18,73956495,Diana,"What an incredible way to visit Boston!  Waking up on the water and enjoying the views right out the front door of the boat was amazing and the evenings were so peaceful.  We were a group of girls and we felt completely safe in the harbor.  Not being right downtown, it was only a few miles driving and a $20-$25 uber to the north end.  We enjoyed meeting the neighbors too!  Ryan was very accommodating, letting us check in a few hours early.  And the bed, seriously most comfortable sleep ever!  Truly a very unique experience!!"
1051482,87854221,2016-07-22,77807509,Brandon,The house boat was a cool experience. Our kids loved seeing the boats and barges going by. We were able to fit 5 people pretty comfortably. The neighbors are great and provide good information on the neighborhood. East Boston is a very diverse area. They are doing a lot to improve the area.
We did find that the water taxi is $25 per person each way from the dock. We used another water taxi for $12/person each way. You can pick that taxi up at the Boston Harbor Shipyard & Marina. One thing that we did have to get used to are the planes flying over during the night. Although kinda of loud,you do eventually get use to them. Overall the stay was nice. Ryan was easily accessible and replied quickly.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
1051482,89138640,2016-07-27,16433122,Charlotte,"We were 6 people staying at the house boat. 2 came from California while the rest of us flew in from Denmark. The house boat was a cool experience for our family reunion. Quite intimate but it worked out fine. We truly enjoyed watching the sunsets and boats/ships passing by from the front porch of the house boat. Boston is a cool city to visit and there is lots to see and explore. We used 'Lift' to get us around. An extra bonus was that the temperature on the water is a few degrees lower which we appreciated during the hot summer days, and the A/C made sure we got a good night sleep. You definitely hear sounds from the city, but we would recommend it if you want to stay close to Boston and have a different experience."

The room is exactly as described and pictured in a quiet neighbourhood but a great location only 4 subway stops away from central downtown Boston. Convenient location, great host, wonderful city and fantastic Air BnB experience. Thank you Brian! :)"

2365632,26611983,2015-02-16,19391819,Matthew,"An amazing place and an amazing host. It's such a comfortable environment for cooking and hanging out with friends, with plenty of space for people to congregate or do their own thing. Plus the amenities were most welcome while it snowed outside (laundry, adjacent driveway, cable TV). On more than one occasion we threatened to simply move in permanently."
We were a little touch and go with our travel schedule,"and Molly was more than accommodating. Thank you for a great stay!\"",,,,

2365632,30446752,2015-04-22,11561170,Lauren,We could not have asked for a more accommodating host or perfect space to stay during our visit to Boston.
The home lived up to its beautiful photos,has wonderful daylight,and offered plenty of space. We especially enjoyed the deck when the sun decided to make an appearance!,,,
The neighborhood is also fantastic - convenient in getting around public transportation; lots of offerings within walking distance; and quiet throughout the night.,,,,,

A few caveats: I would not recommend this rental if you have children under the age of 5 (who are walking). One of the bedrooms is only accessible by very steep latter and my 4-yr old climbed up and then was too terrified to come down.  But i didn't feel it would be safe to have him sleep up there.,,,,,
There aren't very effective window treatments in the bedrooms,so light comes in v early in Spring.,,,,
The place was superficially clean but when I climbed to hang a towel over the window,the dust and grime I encountered (not at eye-level) was gross.,,,,
We loved the books,"movies and the hammock in the living room. Thanks for having us!\"",,,,

The lofty light filled space was so open and lovely and the outdoor porch was incredibly relaxing.  We were bummed that we only had one night there!  There was parking on the street and it was super close to the airport for our early AM flight.  We were so relaxed and just kicking ourselves that we didn't have another day or two to be there!
2365632,40250572,2015-07-29,37823130,Darcy,"Molly was very accommodating and welcoming from the moment we booked the stay through our departure.

Close to public transportation and wonderful eateries and coffee shops within walking distance."
2365632,42682096,2015-08-15,32456420,Cecilia,"From my first interaction to the last, Molly was warm, welcoming, and very generous. Her unique, creatively designed space was just as described - the experience of living there was wonderful. This apartment is right near the center of Jamaica Plain with all the many small shops and restaurants - a safe, fun, accessible neighborhood. And the apartment is also within walking distance of the Pond which provided many beautiful morning and evening strolls."

Everything that was needed to make our stay comfortable was provided and we would highly recommend Molly's apt if you need a place to stay in Boston."
2365632,47679670,2015-09-21,10950457,Nancy,"Our host, Molly, was very available via email, text and phone.  She left a key for us and a note inside with pertinent info. There is a tall staircase at the entrance that you need to take to get into the home and once inside, is bright and spacious.  The bed is very comfy and the bathroom has plenty of room for your stuff, plus a great shower and tub.  We never cooked but the kitchen is very well equipped, including a gas stove and cast iron pans.  Jamaica Plain is a great neighborhood with many places to shop, eat and basically just hang around.  It always felt safe, even after dark.  Our hostess Molly, was very accommodating with letting us leave our luggage there the day of our checkout, since it was late in the afternoon.  All in all, a great visit to a great city."
2365632,49793923,2015-10-06,39517841,Cindy,"Molly was great!  Her communications were clear and easy to follow.We loved the extras she left in the apt. in the form of menus from local restaurants, maps and helpful information.  there was plenty of room for the 3 of us and our adult son did not mind taking the steep steps up to the loft bedroom.  We did have a problem with the heat in the apt initially, but even being a weekend, Molly did everything she could to solve the problem!! Cudos!  Would definately stay again."

2365632,60744771,2016-01-26,4745634,Priscilla,"This is my second stay and my only regret is not writing a rave review last time. Molly is a great host and the apartment is *fabulous*, both in Fall and Winter. Good value for the spacious, light-filled private loft-like space, in a hip neighborhood convenient to shopping (Whole Foods is walkable) and great restaurants, lovely walking streets, not to mention the pond a block or two away. I used the fully stocked kitchen to cook meals and it had everything I needed and then some. The bathtub is huge and wonderful. The deck with outdoor seating is lovely and private. Washer/dryer next to the bathroom is super convenient."
Five stars for communication. Molly is generous,flexible,super accommodating,and has been consistently easy to reach. Even inside the apartment,she has user-friendly post-its everywhere,"and a \"\"welcome/guest/guide book\"\" with everything you'd ever need to know about the apartment and neighborhood. Honestly"

I slept great in the loft, loved the luxurious bathroom, worked comfortably from her light filled space, listening to records. Molly was responsive and easy to communicate with.

Jamaica Plain is away from the rush of downtown Boston, and offers its own array of great restaurants, coffee shops, and beautiful scenery to take in!  We were a quick walk from the T and it didn't take long to get downtown."

9207914,64697171,2016-03-06,54148051,Scott,Great place to stay for a quick trip. Access is very easy with the front desk. And shopping next door is a plus.
9207914,65432790,2016-03-13,3584337,Mike,"The place was very nice and the amenities in the building are excellent. I also found the area to be incredibly convenient. Between the coffee shop and whole foods right next to the building, I always had what I needed and Harrison Rd can be taken right into downtown. No turns to even bother with haha."
Working with Kyle was very efficient. In one message he summed up everything I needed to know,including information about getting into the building,the keys,the wifi,and checking in. That was practically all the communication we needed,but we exchanged a couple more messages about 30 minutes late checking out. He almost always responded within an hour if not a few minutes.
"Cheers to a great host and a very nice place!\"",,,,,
9207914,66230685,2016-03-20,2613686,Calvin,The apartment was really clean and spacious.  Easy walk to downtown and extremely accommodating front desk/concierge.  Extremely good value and would definitely recommend for anyone visiting Boston for a weekend trip.
9207914,66792344,2016-03-24,11491220,Zac,"Kyle's apartment was very clean, modern and located in a new building in Boston's South End neighborhood, which is conveniently situated. While we didn't meet in person, Kyle provided very detailed instructions, and was very communicative and quick to respond to questions. I'd definitely stay again when I next visit Boston."
Thank you,"Kyle!\"",,,,
9207914,67239712,2016-03-27,116112,Gina,Had an excellent trip and a great experience.  Everything went to plan and Kyle was quick to respond to any questions.  Highly recommended!
9207914,67960026,2016-04-01,51809939,Chris,"Great place, beautiful and awesome location."
9207914,69509370,2016-04-11,25500781,Kirsten,"The concierge took us up to the apartment and was very friendly.  The Ink Block building has a very cool lobby and the apartment has a modern vibe and is light and bright.  Easy walk to the T and having the amazing new Whole Foods (which has a spa for mani/pedi's) is super.  The only glitch was problems with the internet and cable TV.  Kyle did send the Cable people over one day, but there were still some problems after that.  Of course that is not Kyle's fault, but you may want to double check that isn't a problem if it is critical for you to be able to surf the web or you like to relax by turning on the TV at night."
9207914,69968452,2016-04-15,13185555,Claudio,"Excelente apartamento, limpo, moderno, confortável e com tudo o que uma pessoa necessita para uma estadia temporária. A localização é muito boa permitindo ir a pé para vários pontos de interesse em Boston. Adicionalmente, está estrategicamente localizado sobre uma loja Whole Foods."
9207914,70485357,2016-04-18,26129514,Janet,"Kyle was an excellent host. He communicated clearly and quickly and he very kindly arranged parking for me when I needed it.  The apartment was clean, easy to access and the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful.  It was incredibly handy having a gym right in the building, a coffee shop (with excellent coffee) just a few steps from the front door and a Whole Foods right next door.  It was a quick walk or drive to Boston Common and great restaurants.  If you're at all noise sensitive though you should be aware that there is a highway that passes nearby."
9207914,70722044,2016-04-20,13720262,Kristin,"Very easy check in process, and Kyle accommodated our early check in request which was great! The apartment was very clean and comfortable and we really enjoyed the neighborhood."

9207914,71640824,2016-04-27,43105465,Mike,The listing was accurate and the building is very accommodating and I felt very safe during my stay
9207914,72464924,2016-05-02,51209060,Katie,"Ink block is an amazing building, staff are always helpful. There was a confusion with the check in, new regulations of the building and they staff couldn't let us in, and it had to be the host. This was very stressful due to my boyfriends flight landing from England in less than an hour. Travelling for 8 hours, this is not what we needed. Especially as we spent a lot of money to stay here, being stressed about check in was not needed. We've stayed at the building before with a different host and never had an issue. However, this was neither the host or buildings fault. Just a miscommunication. However, the host got to us as quickly as possible, and the rest of our stay was perfect."
9207914,72878163,2016-05-05,59233801,Meredith,"Kyle was easy to work with and very responsive. The apartment and facilities were pretty nice, but not very well stocked. The location was perfect for us - within walking distance to most of the places we wanted to go and super easy access to the Whole Foods right downstairs!"
9207914,74106032,2016-05-13,34893724,Joanna,"The apartment was as described, very clean and tidy with everything working well. Kyle was a good host. There was a minor issue when we arrived involving the keys to the apartment which Kyle turned up immediately to fix. Having Whole Foods downstairs was awesome!"
9207914,74940708,2016-05-17,44411246,Martin,"El departamento es tal cual se ve en las imágenes. Es como estar en tu casa. Todas las comodidades. WiFi, utensilios de cocina, lavarropa y secarropas. Muy conformes con todo."
9207914,75272112,2016-05-20,53188431,Erik,The apt was very nice in a great location South end of Boston! Only issue was that the AC did not work so at times it was a little hot in the apt.
9207914,76075027,2016-05-24,58377648,Kristine,"Before arriving at the apartment, Kyle answered all questions thoroughly and promptly (within minutes to an hour usually). The apartment is in a great location with Whole Foods and Peet's right down stairs. The apartment itself is clean, spacious and had enough basics in the kitchen to make a comfy, weekend stay for graduation!"
9207914,76696522,2016-05-29,3244451,Angela,Modern and comfortable apartment. The wholefoods supermarket downstairs and huge and very convenient. Kyle was easy to contact and promptly replied to all messages.
9207914,77951103,2016-06-04,17143805,Alexandre,"Very nice building with all the described amenities (rooftop pool, whole foods in the same block...). The flat is spacious and perfect for a couple staying in Boston. However, we found the bedroom to be very noisy from the street/expressway passing just below the window (flat is on the 2nd floor). This was actually a major drawback since it woke us up almost every night. Also, the curtains are not very efficient to block the sunlight so you should not plan a long morning in bed. Other than that the flat offers all the amenities necessary to make your stay comfortable. The flat is well located, close to Boston Commons."
9207914,78550558,2016-06-07,31753503,Jc,Great and modern luxury apt! Nice terrace !

9207914,81224480,2016-06-21,49757929,Tyler,"This was a great place to stay. It was a nice, trendy, new facility at a very handy location. Kyle was easy to work with and we never were left wanting for anything. I would highly recommend this place."
9207914,83892464,2016-07-04,75379186,Kristen,Kyle apartment is in a great location and was meticulously clean upon arrival. We had a great trip.

9207914,85851997,2016-07-13,36570195,Brian,"The building really was fantastic.  Totally modern and designed beautifully.  The apartment was clean, neat, and very comfortable.  Excellent wi fi and great television.  The apartment had everything we needed, and we could just go downstairs to Whole Foods for anything we wanted.   It is located in Boston's South End which is an ideal location to see the city.  You can walk to some of the best restaurants in Boston and several different train lines are also a quick walk.  We hope to stay here again when we come back up to Boston.  Kyle's instructions to get into the apartment were very clear and we had no issues at all during our stay."
9207914,91317260,2016-08-04,1385246,Bruno,Toutes les informations et photos étaient conformes au logement
"Appartement grand et spacieux à la deco très normalisée peut être un peu trop \"\"hôtelière\"\"(â mon goût)",,,,,
L'appartement est au 2eme étage sur rues,voies rapides et lignes de train donc assez bruyant mais rien d'insupportable tout de même.,,,,
Le lit de la chambre était très confortable.,,,,,
Le whole food juste en bas est très pratique,,,,,
Kyle a toujours été disponible pour répondre à nos demandes d'information notamment pour trouver une solution parking pour notre voiture.,,,,,

9207914,92886257,2016-08-10,25118256,Rose,The place could not have been nicer! I loved the modern kitchen. The foldout couch was very comfortable. The facilities are great and in line with the overall quality of the building. I enjoyed my stay at this very trendy and fun place. Perfect for a couple or party of three. I would definitely recommend this place for business trips. Best value for your money.
735970,2879495,2012-11-13,3875704,Kelley,Wonderful people!  Great location!  Can't wait to return with my family!

735970,32858344,2015-05-22,17982118,Manuel,"Sidney was a welcoming and attentive host as he was there when I arrived, immediately gave me a tour of the apartment, and helped me feel at home. As well, he gave me tips about good restaurants where I could eat that night."
The description of the listing was accurate and I found that the space (the room,private toilet,and access to the study) was quite spacious. It was particularly helpful to have a desk to work on as I,unfortunately,had a lot of work during my trip.,
"The neighborhood was hip and darling. The second \"\"empire\"\" and \"\"stick style\"\" houses give the area a lot of character",and there's a great pond to jog or walk around. As well,great restaurants within five minutes,including a natural grocer that serves great food,a mexican restaurant,a popular ice cream shop
I definitely recommend Sidney and Janelle as hosts,"and would definitely stay there again.  \"",,,,

2886933,13447992,2014-05-27,3629393,Omar,It was great staying at Katy's place. My brother and I went on memorial day weekend for a friend's grad party. We needed a place close to the suburbs of Boston. I would recommend her place for groups of up to 5-6 people. Plenty of space. Everything was exactly as described. Very clean and tidy and looked just like the pictures if not better. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were exceptionally well taken care of. Nice neighborhood with a distinct charm and not too far from the city as well. Katy was also great at communicating with us and was always within reach. Would definitely consider staying here again!
2886933,13989379,2014-06-09,16023694,Michael,"I stayed at Katy's place for two days and I can't say anything but good words about the host and the house. The house provided us with everything we needed such as beds, towels, and an unlimited supply of water and fruit.  It is perfect for a group of 4 or 5 people with a lot of space in the house. Katy is an amazing host reminding me of my own mother. She made me feel like I was at home, provided advice and suggestions and constantly maintained communication to make sure our stay was nothing below perfect. I highly recommend staying here and I would come back to Katy's whenever I go back to Boston!"
2886933,15362630,2014-07-07,175332,Ramseshu,I booked Katy's house for July 4th weekend and it was our last minute plan and
Katy was very good though out the course of communication right from day of inquiry. She was very considerate in waiting for my decision at the cost of loosing her other guests as she was already talking to me.,,,,,
Katy house looked exactly like it was shown in the pictures. House was squeaky clean. Fresh towels,fruits,coffee and drink were included and free to use,,,
House is very accessible  to North or South side of Boston,about 15-20 mins drive. We felt like home when we were at Katy's house.,,,,

Katy s'est montrée très compréhensive: un de nos enfants étant allergique aux poils de chats, ces derniers n'étaient pas là pendant notre séjour. A notre arrivée, nous avons eu la bonne surprise de trouver cerises, cookies et boissons fraiches à notre disposition."
La maison correspond parfaitement à la description et aux photos. Donc maison très belle,très agréable,spacieuse,bien équipée et très bien entretenue avec une propreté irréprochable.,,

2886933,21214179,2014-10-13,20767833,Veronique,"Katy is amazing! The house is spacious, very clean and well decorated. We had delicious cookies and a plate of fresh fruits on our arrival. We even had milk, eggs and refreshments in the fridge that Katy left for us saying we could take them. There is also a lot of clean bathroom towels left on our disposal. We had the best hostess, Itsy, her cat. If you rent the house make sure to take a really good care of her because she's a wonderful and loving cat. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful.  We would definitely rent the house again if we go to Boston."
2886933,21838251,2014-10-25,8133320,Janet,Katy was a great host-- her home is beautiful and very comfortable. We arrived later in the evening and she had the heat turned on so that the house would be warm when we arrived. Everything was very clean and as described. A perk was her very friendly kitty! We will definitely stay again when we visit the Boston area the next time! We wish we were staying the entire weekend to really enjoy relaxing in the house!

I recommand this house to everyone!,,,,,
Katy a été super avec nous! La communication est très facile,rapide et ultra sympathique. La maison est très belle,propre et dans un merveilleux quartier non loin du centre ville. L'accueil fut très chaleureux,même si nous n'avons pas pu rencontrer Katy. Elle nous avait laissé des biscuits et des boissons froides! :),,
"Je recommande fortement cette demeure pour un séjour à Boston!\"",,,,,
2886933,23105340,2014-11-23,21706435,Eric,"It was a great experience. Katy was very flexible with the check in time, and left a bunch of small amenities, and the snack basket was a nice touch. Her cat, Itsy, was adorable and active, but she didn't use her litter box once, and we were assured that this wasn't normal."
2886933,23401026,2014-11-30,1587632,Artem,"We enjoyed staying at Katy's house so much! The moment we stepped into it we felt immediately at home. It was spacious for our company of 6, clean, warm and beautiful! The living room with the fireplace was amazing. We also made friends with Katy's cat - Itchy - and she obviously contributed to overall coziness of the place :) Katy was a great host, very helpful and caring. We would definitely recommend staying at her house!"
2886933,26948651,2015-02-22,16929011,Brendan,"My basketball team needed a place to stay for the regional tournament at Boston University, and Katy was kind enough to trust a platoon of college boys with her home for the weekend. The house was all we needed and more. It was warm, homey, and spacious. There was bed-space for eight and the living room was perfect for hanging out in between games. Katy was also extremely helpful during the entire process-- she took time from her vacation to help me with the TV, she advised me on using the radiators, etc. Overall, it was a fantastic experience, and I'm so happy that we were able to get into contact with Katy.  Thanks Katy! Your house is awesome!"
2886933,30437382,2015-04-22,6338124,Éloïse,"Our stay at Katy's home was wonderful. The house itself is gorgeous but it was the warm welcome that made our visit so enjoyable. We were set up with lots of information about the city (maps, guides, magazines). A great place for kids with the yard and basketball nets. This family are perfect hosts!"
2886933,32341483,2015-05-17,29928099,Gina,"The house was lovely and quite large.  Fireplaces and radiators all added to it's charm. We all felt right at home. Enjoyed the living room the most where we could all sit and talk.  My grandson loved playing with the cars, Lincoln logs, and especially the drums.  Plenty of food left for us to eat.  We felt at ease and very welcome.  Loved the blackboard with our own special welcome message. Only thing that would have helped would have been 2 full baths as there were 7 of us.  Would stay there again if we have the opportunity. Thanks so much Katy."
2886933,33131326,2015-05-25,32009973,John,"This pretty home was exactly as advertised, and exactly what we were looking for. It is a charming house that had plenty of room for our party of 5 adults. We came into the house to a welcome message on a tall blackboard, and a bowl of fruit on the kitchen table. There were also snacks, sparkling water and coffee waiting for us. The owner was very helpful recommending traveling in and out of Boston, and stores and other places we may need in the neighborhood. It was an easy drive to the train, and a quick ride to the center of the city. As bustling as Boston was during the day, the house was quiet in the evening. It was just perfect. We had a lovely family vacation, and will always remember our stay in this pretty house."
2886933,34325537,2015-06-07,33190945,Shadyra,"Katy's place was awesome! The house looked exactly how it did in the photos and it was more than enough space for my group of 6. Katy was extremely honest about her spacing and true to her description the only downfall of the house is that there is only one (full) bathroom. (but I must say the 1.5 bathroom is extremely spacious!!) Katy called me a couple days before my arrival and gave me the rundown on everything, including how to gain entrance to the house and operate the AC/heat. It was a short walk to the train station and a cheap Uber ride from downtown. When we arrived at the house we were greeted with a welcome note from Katy as well as a breakfast consisting of fruit, English muffins, and sparkling water. She left us with a mini guide complete with take out menus and walking/driving directions into Boston. We were able to adjust our check-in time due to issues with our bus arrival and Katy was very patient and understanding when we needed to add a person to our group last minute. There were fresh towels, a blow dryer, hair products, and lotion available in the bathroom. We also had access to an iPhone dock, various chargers Katy left throughout the house, and we were able to add some of her board games to our game night. It was an awesome stay and if I find myself in the area again I would definitely stay at Katy's."
2886933,36477978,2015-06-28,1619580,Antonia,"What a lovely property ! This was the perfect house to stay over a 3 day weekend : the location is very convenient, there are lots of very nice places to eat in the area and the commute to Boston is very easy and fast. The house itself has a lot of character and charm and was big enough to accommodate us all very comfortably since we were 4 adults and 3 children. We felt at home straight away and the kids were thrilled to play with the 2 cats. Katy was a real delight to deal with: at all times she was available for questions, made sure we had everything we needed and even left some food and cookies for us when we arrived !"

2886933,38000708,2015-07-12,35408688,Erica,"The house was a lovely place for my family to stay during our weekend trip to the area. Katy was an excellent communicator throughout the booking process. We had two people in our party who were allergic to cats and she was extremely accommodating, making sure two of the bedrooms remained cat-free prior to our arrival. She gave us detailed information about entering the house, and orienting ourselves once we were inside. The house is charming with space to lounge. The back area was a beautiful place to sit with a table/chairs and nice yard. The house does only have one full bath and a half bath but that was okay with us. Wonderful price for a spacious house.

The house was comfortable and as advertised and Katy did everything she could to make sure we were welcome.  Having only one full bath took a little bit of management in the morning, but we worked it out.  Thanks!"
2886933,43997082,2015-08-23,7400201,Honnie,The house was perfect for our weekend family trip. Our kids especially loved the treats Katy left and playing with the cats. We went to Boston to celebrate our daughters birthday. Katy left a sweet birthday message and a cake. Our daughter was really touched by her thoughtfulness. The location made it easy to get to downtown Boston. Our family of 6 felt very comfortable in the house. Katy was a gracious host. We hope to stay again when we return to Boston.

Katy is a thoughtful and welcoming host, who provided us with a notebook about the area (including public transit information, which was a plus!) and left fresh fruit and cookies for us to eat upon our arrival. Katy's home is spacious and beautifully decorated -- the perfect place for our far-flung family to reconnect. All of the bedrooms are attractive and the beds are extremely comfortable. Special features include a third floor bedroom that has a great view of the neighborhood and two of the sweetest cats you will ever meet. We hope to book with Katy again!"

Their two cats are very friendly.  Due to an allergy,Katy kept the third floor bedroom cat-free prior to our arrival,which was very effective and appreciated!,,,
The kitchen was well stocked and it was easy for us to cook and eat meals at the house. Katy even left us some snacks which we appreciated after a long ride there!,,,,,
Parking was great.  The location was easily accessible with lots of amenities close by.,,,,,
Katy provided me with information on the house prior to arrival which was very helpful.  She has also prepared a binder of information at the house about the house and the area.  This was a nice touch that made it easy to acquaint ourselves to the house and the area!,,,,,
Katy was very quick to respond whenever I had any inquiries both before and during our stay.,,,,,
We had a great time there and would definitely stay again!,,,,,

2886933,54060208,2015-11-15,17938634,Best,"Katy was a great host and her home is amazing. Me and 3 of my friends came to Boston to celebrate our college friends bday, and wanted a place that was spacious and conveniently located outside the city but not too far. This was the perfect place for us."
Katy was so considerate providing us with detailed information about how to get the key,use the heat and Apple TV,and even said we could help ourselves to the food in the fridge. She has two beautiful cats,and they were pretty awesome. They did their own thing for the most part but sometimes they would look for attention which was just fine!,,
The rooms were great and the beds and pillows were so comfortable. We had no complaints about the nights sleep we got this weekend.,,,,,
"This is only my second time using Airbnb  but I can confidently say there's not many other places where you can experience better hospitality than here! I would definitely stay at Katy's home again! \"",,,,,
2886933,57948213,2015-12-30,50832593,Marleny,"She was a good host who was helpful with many details including hunger quenching  breakfast food, directions for the trip and tips for amenities around the house. The neighborhood was perfect for a family and the house was exactly as described. The cats were wonderfully friendly and low maintenance. All around the house was very clean and cozy."

2886933,74448361,2016-05-15,3302641,Tobin,"Katy was an amazing host!  She sent detailed instructions, texted me to make sure everything was okay, left us snacks in the fridge, and generally made the experience one of the most pleasant AirBNBs I've ever done.  The neighborhood is cute and it's easy to take an Uber to the nearest T stop and get to downtown Boston.  We didn't have a single complaint, and I'd recommend her house to anyone, especially with large groups, because the place is HUGE!"
"\"",,,,,
2886933,77157344,2016-05-30,4335433,Xenia,"Katy has a beautiful home in a very nice residential area south of Boston.  The first floor has a lot of nice open space for gathering with several couches, a dining room table, etc., and the bedrooms are located on the second and third floors with very comfortable beds.  The backyard has a nice garden for relaxing with a patio table and some chairs.  Would definitely recommend Katy's home to anyone looking to stay in the Hyde Park area (probably not super convenient if you mostly want to be downtown)."
"Katy herself was very invested in making sure that my family had a great weekend and went out of her way to help accommodate us.  Thanks for everything!\"",,,,,

It is walking distance from several restaurants and a nice downtown area with bank, pharmacy, etc. Katy provided fresh fruit and other breakfast items for us to munch on.  The cats are an absolute delight.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  If you get a chance, definitely stay here."

Our family found this to be a perfect place to celebrate our daughters birthday and just be together. The bedrooms were very comfortable, plenty of beautiful towels and linens. The whole house was very clean! Katy was very easy to contact and everything went very smoothly. I would certainly stay here again. We loved her cats!"

Katy made the stay as pleasant for us as possible and if we ever return to Boston we would definitely stay at Katy's house again. The girls especially loved the cookies.
2886933,95457034,2016-08-19,20662059,Annette,A lovely house. Very large but has a great homely feel. Everything that is needed for a comfortable stay was provided.

13296735,80879003,2016-06-20,68581504,Xenia,This was an excellent experience. We are more than happy with our stay. The house is a beautiful and cozy place located only minutes away from Downtown Boston. Ronald and Ignacio were super friendly and had everything necessary there for us. The absolute highlights of our stay were the house pool (simply amazing!) and a tasty and healthy breakfast prepared with so much love. We will definitely be back and highly recommend this place!!!

Location just outside of the city and you are near public transportation, and Uber is no more than a few minutes to your door when requested. We took the commuter rail which gets you there in less than 10-15 minutes for a couple of bucks - well worth it!"
The room we stayed in was very well-kept,and the house was very quaint,we felt very comfortable and our hosts provided us with an unforgettable experience - preparing our breakfast daily every morning,asking if there was anything we needed,tidying up our private restroom,and keeping things in order - not to mention
For pet-lovers such as my husband and I,it was very nice to spend time with their pets since we were so far from ours. The pool and patio are very private and relaxing.  It was a nice addition to our stay.,,,,
We would definitely recommend this location,and wouldn't think twice if we visited Boston again.,,,,
Thank you again for an excellent experience!,,,,,

The garden and pool area are  beyond beautiful.  It's a nice place for morning coffee or relaxing any time of day.  My room was beautifully decorated with art from around the world and had everything I needed including a writing table/chair, a private bath , radio/TV and French doors leading to the garden/pool  via a large deck."

Their home is filled with personality and their sweet dogs were an extra perk. They went out of their way to make us feel welcome including Ignacio whipping us up a delicious cocktail he was trying out a new recipe for and giving us a ride to the T so we could go explore Boston!"

13296735,95995202,2016-08-21,83808816,Laurie,"My daughter and I spent 5 days in Boston and stayed with Ron and Ignacio. They were great hosts and the house was so cute, clean and comfortable! They were both there when we arrived and departed (Ignacio was sick but still got up to see us off!). They made sure we had everything we needed, had breakfast waiting for us and made us lattes and margaritas. They made sure we knew where to go, best trains to take, best spots to visit, provided maps, advice and their phone numbers in case we got lost or needed anything. The house was so cute with a great backyard with a beautiful deck and (URL HIDDEN) relaxing! The location is perfect, only about 15 min by train to downtown Boston, and close to the freeway if your heading North or South to Cape Cod (about 90 min. away). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were treated more like family than guests. We will definitely stay with Ron and Ignacio again if we are back in the area!"
13296735,97826630,2016-08-28,51582251,Albert,"Ron and Ignacio hosted one of the best places I've stayed yet.  Both of them are extremely nice and accommodating, and their place has exactly the type of charming personality one would expect out of an AirBnB rental.

He is super friendly and has helped me out a lot, and is easy to communicate with by phone of text. The house is everything you would expect of an excellent airbnb: it is clean, quiet, and homey. The kitchen has dishes and supplies for cooking, and each room has its own key. The location is on a quiet street with a nice backyard but close to a bus stop for the 57 and 66 busses, and also close to the mbta green line \"\"b\"\" train.

The neighborhood is great - right on the water with lots of nice restaurants within easy walking distance.  My host Daniel was wonderful, as he bent over backwards to ensure that I had everything I needed at all times during my stay - we were in constant communication the entire time.  The apartment is a very nice studio in an upscale building with security, so felt very safe.  Finally, you simply can't beat the value. Hotels are SO expensive in Boston - I would have had to spend twice the money to stay at a hotel in the Seaport area.  If you're looking for a nice studio in a trendy, upscale Boston neighborhood that offers tremendous privacy at a great value, then this is the spot for you.  Thanks again Daniel for making my first AirBnB experience so nice!"

They offered everything to us from bottled water, to extra chairs, and even disposable cutlery and paper plates. The room was at par with a very good hotel room, it was immaculately clean. Both bathrooms were also extremely clean at all times, with high quality toiletries provided for us along with good quality towels. Over and above all this, the conversations we had with everyone who lived in the house were so good; they made us feel like we were home 7000 miles away from home."

6823017,85454682,2016-07-11,34316965,Elizabeth,"Everything was fine. The floors, though beautiful were crunchy with something. The mattress was wonderful. It is a nice house and very convenient for our needs. Didn't meet Joe (didn't expect to) so I can't comment on him but the room was fine"
6823017,85931064,2016-07-14,20457899,Beeta,Joe was a great host! His place was clean and had a fun and inviting atmosphere! We had use of many areas of the house and Joe provided us with many amenities like towels etc. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable! I felt safe and really enjoyed the Allston area. We were a quick walk away from The Harvard campus and a lot of good restaurants. If I come back I will book with Joe again!
6823017,86260583,2016-07-15,39358275,Juergen,Very easy and good communication. We would stay there again!

6823017,91108685,2016-08-03,18824978,Jens,Nice and clean room close to Harvard Business School (about ten minute walk). Joe is a very friendly host and explains the accomodation as well as bus connection etc.
6823017,93269090,2016-08-12,67780629,Inkyu,Very convenient location for people who want to be near Allston and Longwood area. Clean room and easy to communicate with tenant. We had a godo stay here.

6823017,95124136,2016-08-18,54779783,Seulbi (Bailey),The room was so clean! It was a little bit further from downtown than I expected but still good to stay and travel around Boston.
6823017,95629976,2016-08-20,7614754,Paolina,Good experience.  Affordable place to stay close to Cambridge. Very responsive and helpful host.
3985462,19582994,2014-09-14,21247394,John,Where do I start?
First off,the location is phenomenal... Right in the middle of everything,but on a relatively quiet side street on Marlborough St..  The apartment is literally two blocks in one direction from the shops and restaurants on Newbury Street,two blocks in a different direction brings you to the beautiful Charles River and Mass Ave bridge that crosses over to MIT/Cambridge and finally in another direction you are just a few blocks from Fenway and Kenmore Square!,,
As for the apartment itself,the space combines the best of old and new. It offers the charm of a historic brownstone so quintessential to Boston,but it has been completely updated- everything seems brand new and sparkling clean,with cool little touches like built-in USB outlets in the kitchen,an outlet in the bathroom that has a built-in night light,and an electronic apartment door.  Also
Lastly,a quick word on Jason the host... Jason could not have been more welcoming and accommodating. Jason gave me recommendations on things to do and see and let me know that absolutely no question or request was too small. Made me feel at home but gave me my space and privacy.,,,,
If you are thinking of staying here,I can't recommend it enough and I hope to stay here again on future visits to Boston!!!,,,,
"\"",,,,,
3985462,20453710,2014-09-29,21217271,Gregory,Jason makes you feel right at home.  He's most accommodating and very thorough.  The welcoming gifts were a very nice touch.  Jason was very easy to reach and quick to respond and left various contact in case he couldn't be reached.  The apartment was very clean and true to its description.  You feel like your staying in a luxury suite at a hotel but more comfortable.  Updated kitchen and bath made it even better.  Jason provides you information and directions to various venues and means of transportation that is most beneficial to anyone staying in Boston for the first time.
"The location was idea.  Walking distance to shopping and many restaurants on Newberry St. and Prudential Plaza plus the \"\"T\"\".     The addition of a Trader Joe's  to the area made stocking up on groceries for my daughter in college so much easier.",,,,,
Overall,great apartment,great location,"great experience!  Highly recommended.\"",,
3985462,20665272,2014-10-03,21486077,Michael,"Jason was my first Airbnb host — and he's set the bar high. The apartment was clean, roomy and equipped with a brand new kitchen. The surrounding neighborhood of Back Bay was quiet and a centrally located. A considerate and friendly host, Jason had plenty of advice for my parents and me — all three of us were newcomers to Boston — and provided us with everything we need. (He even brought us a toaster from his own apartment downstairs.) I'd highly recommend his place to anyone visiting Boston."
3985462,20855711,2014-10-06,21506571,Sarah,"This Marlborough St apartment is spacious,beautiful and conveniently located close to both the best of Back Bay and the Mass Ave bridge for an easy walk to Cambridge. Jason was a great host, provided lots of information before the visit as well as meeting us upon arrival to show us around and answer questions. The unit had some nice extra touches, including a Nespresso machine and even fresh flowers. Building was quiet (some street noise on Friday and Saturday nights). Only negative is that the unit did have a bit of a smoke smell, which may be due to a smoker in another unit in the building or perhaps a previous tenant in the apartment."
3985462,21088404,2014-10-11,19238279,Mary,"What an awesome stay, and such a gracious host!  Jason met me with a bottle of wine when I arrived in the evening, how sweet is that?!  He also made his parking space behind the townhouse available to me for a small fee, which was super-generous of him (otherwise parking in the area can be stressful).  The unit was gorgeous, brand-new interior with shiny hardwood floors, big windows and high ceilings.  The bed was super-comfy, with 800+ thread sheets and a fluffy down comforter.  It turned chilly while I was there, and Jason turned the heat on for the whole building, plus brought up a space heater in case I needed it.  The building is quiet with lots of privacy, but Jason made it clear that he was right there if I needed anything.  The location is perfect, right off Mass Ave and a quick walk/bike to MIT.  All in all, a wonderful visit to my old neighborhood from my Boston days.  I'll look forward to visiting Jason again and staying in his lovely apartment."
3985462,21237136,2014-10-13,21748005,Frankie,"Visited Boston for 3 days, 2 nights with my girlfriend. We contacted Jason about arriving in Boston way earlier than expected and that we would hang around to meet the check in time but he told us that the place was ready for us (even before we left for Boston) At arrival. Jason was there waiting for us, very nice and helpful guy. Check in was quick and easy, even had a welcoming gift for us. We arrived hungry and he offered to ride us to a restaurant.  The Place is amazing, very cozy in a quite neighborhood. From bathroom, to kitchen, really liked it. Walking to the train was also quick and easy. Jason was always quick to reply when I contacted him, we had no worries, felt like he was always on hand. We visited many places in Boston and getting to the house was simple for us so se felt good about that. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. There is only one bed so a group of 3 and up might be too much. Tv with cable, netflix,  new heater, etc. The day of our departure was also very smooth. It felt like our little home, only spent the weekend there and will honestly say im going to miss the place, hard to leave. Hope to stay here again when I visit in the future!"
3985462,21427736,2014-10-17,21297206,Lynda,"We felt most welcomed by Jason.  The updated suite was warm, uncluttered and stylistic.  Jason provided a helpful and thorough description of all that a newcomer to Boston would need.  The documentation was comprehensive, accurate and important for us to reference. He checked in on us to make sure things were OK but was not the least intrusive.  The neighbourhood was an ideal and well located to launch day trips into Boston.  We hope to return to Boston and will not hesitate to stay at Jason's suite if it is available."
3985462,21665428,2014-10-21,20541839,H,"The most accommodating and courteous host we ever have stayed with--he thought of practically everything, and was quick to help with everything else.  The location is great; just a few minutes to the nearest subway station and just a few blocks from all the shopping on Newbury Street.  All of the recent updates to the apartment are very nice and make the stay more comfortable.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat."
3985462,21803329,2014-10-24,22458274,Robin,"This was my first AirBnB and if everyone else has the high qualities of Jason then this will be a permanent part of my travel itinerary.  Jason was a perfect host, welcomed me in a friendly and engaing manner; was engaging and at the same time respectful of privacy and solicitous of my needs.  The neighborhood is absolutely wonderful and everything in the apartment was as advertised.  In all, a great AirBnB experience."
3985462,21885644,2014-10-26,21419684,Alexandra,"Great host, very attentive with email.  Apartment is lovely, in a great neighborhood and looks exactly like the images posted."
3985462,22190860,2014-11-01,19957392,Lou,"What a lovely apartment, we felt 'at home'! It's a shame we could only stay 3 nights. Jason was very organised and sent us all the necessary details prior to check-in. Jason did come and introduce himself and reassured us if we needed anything we could text him. However, the apartment was so well equipped and the information he had given so thorough, we didn't need to."
Thank you for a lovely stay in Boston,"we will be recommending your property to our family and friends. Hopefully we will be back one day :-) \"",,,,
3985462,22434056,2014-11-06,7702195,Elisa,"This apartment is fantastic.  Location, comfort and ease of check in along with a very reasonable price for Boston and it's a super bargain.  I didn't want to leave.  You are close enough to the tourist attractions but removed enough that you feel like a Boston local.  Being very close to the Prudential Center and several very good restaurants top things off.  Jason could not have been a better host.  Will try to stay here again on my next visit to Boston."
3985462,22529410,2014-11-09,21850459,Jeannine,"Great place to stay! Only a couple minutes walk from the nearest T station. Close to Fenway, restaurants, bars, shops. Jason was so accommodating. We arrived really early in the morning but he let us store our luggage in his place downstairs until the unit was ready. The place was super clean, neat and quiet. It had all the accommodations we needed. I consider myself a neat freak and this place was really clean. Perfect place for our visit. Great neighborhood. Safe and easily accessible. I recommend a couple of restaurants in walking distance: Eastern Standard and Island Creek Oyster Bar."
3985462,22665882,2014-11-11,22814343,Michael,"Jason met us at the door and took us up when we arrived.  The place was great.  Clean, nicely furnished, had a very classy apartment feel in a great neighborhood.  It was central to where we wanted to go and visit.  Definitely will stay here again, and will highly recommend it to all our friends as well as to any others contemplating Jason's place to stay when visiting Boston."
3985462,22836805,2014-11-16,22202415,Karen,"With about 40 hours to spend on our first visit to Boston (Friday evening through Sunday morning), the goal was to see and do as much as we could to get a taste of the city. Renting this apartment in the Back Bay area of the city got us off to a great start.   Our hosts' welcome began before we arrived with detailed information about the public transportation options. The Logan express bus is the perfect solution for getting to this part of the city  from the airport - and the price is right  @ $5 a person. The express stop is at Hynes convention center, a short walk from the apt."
Jason met us at the door when we arrived on Friday evening and even helped carry a bag. He gave us the details about the apt.,house,and neighborhood and shared some nearby restaurant options. We ate at the Corner Tavern across the street that first evening - a cozy place with great food and service. We walked to Trader Joe's later to pick up some items for breakfast. A new experience finding a full grocery in a small basement! - we're used to sprawling stores at ground level. Truly a walk-able neighborhood with everything you need within a few blocks.,,,
Saturday was a cool,sunny day. The trees were close to the end of their fall color - just gorgeous! We were able to complete the entire Freedom Trail,took the T on the return trip to Back Bay,spent time in late afternoon viewing the GOYA exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts,and then made our way back to the apt. via Fenway Park. We knew ahead of time we couldn't tour Fenway that day because of events that were taking place there,"but saw the \"\"green monster\"\" from the outside - that satisfied the baseball fan."
It was a great day and so nice to return to the apt. instead of a hotel room. The apartment is newly renovated,tastefully furnished,spotless,and extremely comfortable - great bed,by the way. It was fun to raise the shades in the morning and look out on the neighborhood. Just a bit different from the street of single family homes  in our small town neighborhood in the mid-west.,
Our hosts' hospitality continued throughout the weekend. They were gracious and thoughtful,continuing to make us feel welcome during our entire stay.,,,,
Our stay in the apartment was all I had hoped for: comfortable,relaxing,and a front row seat to life in Back Bay. Hope to visit Boston when we can stay longer and would love to stay here again if it is available!!,,,
Thank you,Mark and Karen,,,,

3985462,23035324,2014-11-21,22243445,John,"Jason was a very attentive host, replying to messages almost instantly. He provided clear and comprehensive information so that we had no trouble finding the apartment or getting in. The apartment itself is spacious, clean and well-appointed and we were very comfortable. Its location is very convenient for seeing the sights of Boston and we were able to walk everywhere.  We left by train from the South Station and it was a very easy walk to the nearby T station."
3985462,23523735,2014-12-03,22047288,Mariana,"El Departamento de Jason es muy acogedor, tanto que te hace sentir como en casa. Nuestra estadía fue excelente esta muy bien equipada y en una locación privilegiada. En un barrio donde es fácil moverse cercano a restaurantes, tiendas y otras atracciones que tiene esta bella ciudad. Agradecemos a Jason su preocupación para que fuera todo muy comodo."

He was also always available when we were at the apartment and needed help. The place its lf was beautiful, in great location, and clean. Will definitely recommend this place. Thank you Jason."
3985462,25106348,2015-01-06,22261136,Li,"Jason is a very professional host. His welcome letter sent out before checking-in reveals that -- the letter covers everything I could think of. Accessing was no problem. Room was not super spacious but understandable due to its location in heart of the town. The host has good style about everything in the unit. There is a fully equipped kitchen with very modernized electronics. Wifi is fast. The TV even has Netflix and Hulu. I believe all the windows are sound-proof as I didn't hear anything from the street. Rooms were very clean. New towels. Premium brand shower gel / hand soap. The bed is very comfortable as well. For the 2 kids we used the inflated bed, which seems a premium brand one too. The best thing about this place is the location -- I had a conference at Sheraton and hotels around. They are all within 15min walk. To sum up, Jason is the one of the best hosts I had. Will definitely stay again next time."
3985462,25292569,2015-01-11,3891958,Justin,Great apartment in a great location. Jason made check-in easy and was fast to respond to messages. Highly recommend.

3985462,25559677,2015-01-19,25022879,Arleen,"This back bay aparment is a hidden gem of perfection. It feels cozy from the moment you walk in. The furniture is very stylish and comfortable.   I rate the entire cleanliness and organization of the home  a 10. The location was perfect. Walking distance is the outdoor shops of newbury street. Anything that is considered  a must see in Boston is near. The T is a few blocks away, but if you go in 9 degree weather like I did then a uber car can pick you within seconds. My average uber one way trip rate was $5."
Jason was a gracious host. He never bothered me and always reply quickly to any message I had. Thanks to him we were able to visit one of the best museums in Boston for free. Overall,I rate my stay 5 stars. Highly recommended,"you won't be disappointed.\"",,,
3985462,25777914,2015-01-25,3272469,Ric,"Holy smokes, this was such a perfect place to stay. Our main destination was the Museum of Fine Arts - which was an easy stroll away. Superb place, great location; I can't imagine much that would have made it a better stay.  Jason, our host, was also wonderful, and ever so helpful."
3985462,26020756,2015-02-01,5656256,Melita,I was fortunate to make it up to Boston between two blizzards.
First,if you need to be in a great,central location,whether because of cold weather and snow or not,what a wonderful place to stay! A market with all the essentials is practically IN the place,only 3 doors down. Walk up a few blocks to lots of attractions and restaurants and convenient to the Common. Beautifully renovated apt that is: Safe. Comfortable. Cozy. Spacious. Has everything you need

3985462,26740002,2015-02-18,25789819,Angela,"Jason made us feel so very welcome and was so helpful.  The apartment exceeding our expectations and the location was fabulous.  I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending Apartment 6, 428 Marlborough Street to anyone and in fact when we come back for our daughter's graduation we shall definitely book it once more. Thank you Jason for being the perfect host, for making us feel so welcomed and for introducing us to your lovely little dog Teddy :)"

The apartment is very clean and well taken care of and it's quiet, which was important to us. The location was perfect, just a quick walk to Newbury Street and all the shops plus some great restaurants."

3985462,27406050,2015-03-03,27769450,Espen,"This was our first experience with airbnb and we were very satisfied. The appartment was very nice and exactly as described on the airbnb website. The appartment is located in a very nice area with very good connections to bus or metro. The city is rather small, so you can easily walk to MIT, museums or shopping streets from the appartment. There is even a store located 30 m/ 100 feet beside the entrance. We were very happy with this appartment and we absolutely recommend this place!"
3985462,27653244,2015-03-09,26797923,Thomas,"Wow, what a great place! We immensely enjoyed our stay in Jason's apartment. The apartment was clean and spacious enough for 4 and comfortable. The location is nearby plenty of places to eat and has quick access to mass transit, we were able to get to the other side of town in just over 25 minutes. Jason is a great host and made sure our stay was comfortable and was available in case we needed help. Thanks Jason, this apartment will be at the top of our list next time we are in town!"
3985462,28122790,2015-03-18,26465153,Sally,Jason is quite friendly and a very accommodating host.  The location allowed us to stay very near a family member and was convenient to points of interest and public transportation in the City.

Jason's place is extremely clean,as he has it cleaned professionally after every guest's stay. The shower's huge shampoo and body wash containers made me feel like I was staying at a luxury hotel,and the rest of the apartment was just as nice. The living room was spacious,TV was awesome (with free Netflix and Hulu Plus!),and the bed was very comfortable!,
I had a friend come over for a couple of hours,and she needed a place to park. Jason was very easy to contact,and he even walked outside with us to point out an area where we could street park.,,,

3985462,29301674,2015-04-06,28581996,Claudia,Die Wohnung ist einfach zum Wohlfühlen!
Besonders begeistert waren wir von  einigen technischen Details,wie zB. USB Steckdosen,die sehr praktisch sind um die Handys und iPads zu laden. Die freundliche und saubere Wohnung liegt in einem sehr schönen,ruhigen und sicheren Viertel von Boston,wo wir uns sofort heimisch gefühlt haben! Jason ist ein absolut engagierter Gastgeber und hat uns sogar für unsere Kinder eine neue Wii mit der neuesten Mario Kart Version zur Verfügung gestellt. Wir wären gerne länger als 6 Tage geblieben,"denn es war ein perfekter Auftenhalt - das nächte Mal sicher wieder bei Jason!\""
3985462,31504970,2015-05-06,11248183,Kristy,We couldn't have asked for a better first time Airbnb experience.
Communication with Jason was fabulous. Prior to arrival,Jason provided a detailed document with instructions about the accomodation,to and from instructions,facility instructions and recommendations about the local area.,,
Upon arrival,Jason texted us to see how we were settling in and arranged a time to come and give us some local tips which were extremely helpful.,,,,
The location of the apartment was perfect for us,5 minute walk to Newbury and Boylston streets with endless shopping and food options,10 minute walk to Fenway Park,where we saw a couple of Redsox games,10 minute walk to the Prudential Centre where we had our first Cheesecake Factory experience,and about 15min walk to Back Bay train station. The local area felt extremely safe
The apartment itself was exactly as described and as per the pictures - it's beautiful and is the perfect size for two people. Full kitchen facilities,comfy sofa,very comfy bed and high quality linens and towelling. The apartment was spotless. It was also completely private,but Jason made it clear that he was available to us via text or phone call when needed.,,

The unit was just as described and it was obvious they put a lot of work into making it welcoming and functional. Jason stopped by to visit with us and we will definitely call on him again!

3985462,32746255,2015-05-21,10109086,Katherine,"My mother and I stayed at Jason's apartment for 3 nights, and we loved our time there.  The location is absolutely fantastic: convenient and within walking distance to everything, (especially Fenway and the rest of beautiful Back Bay).  For my fellow runners/walkers, the easy proximity to the Esplanade is lovely.  The lockbox entry made our arrival and departure so easy, and we felt very secure."
The Marlboro Market on the corner is great when you're in a pinch,and there are so many other stores,restaurants and cafes so close by.  We loved staying in a beautiful old building,and we really appreciated how well-renovated the apartment is; the building's stairs are a little creaky,but the apartment has lovely,sturdy hardwood floors.
The apartment gets great light,was very clean,and is very well-appointed.  The kitchen is stocked well,if you want to cook,and the furniture is very comfortable.  The dining room table is a beautiful spot to sit by the windows and look out.  The tv is great,with on-demand tv as well.  The bed was very comfortable
Lastly,Jason couldn't have been a more courteous and responsive host.  His welcome letter had all the information we needed and more (which is SO appreciated),and he responded to my emails before and during the trip very quickly and was so kind when we had a snafu on our departure day.,,,
In all,we absolutely loved our stay.  It felt like home every time we returned,"and we hated to leave after our 3 days were up!\"",,,

He took the time to meet with us when we first arrived and told us all about the city.   He also gave us all of his contact information so we could ask him questions throughout the trip.  Jason's apartment was amazing.  It was exactly as it looked in the pictures.  It had a very well stocked kitchen with new appliances.  The apartment was spotless and very well decorated. It was within walking distance of all of Boston, and had pretty much everything you could possibly need within a half mile.  We really hope this apartment is available on our next trip to Boston because we would love to stay here again!"

The accommodations were exactly as described on AirbnB...lovely bedroom, with plenty of room in the living room for the air mattress.  The kitchen area was clean and modern and well equipped.  We love the cute neighborhood that surrounds the apartment.  We were in town for a Red Sox game, so we were able to walk there in 10 minutes, and there are tons of restaurants and cafes within a 5 minute walk as well.   Jason is a fantastic host!  From the time we booked the apartment, he communicated immediately and began checking in regularly regarding any questions we might have had.  The process couldn't have been any easier!  We look forward to renting this unit, or any other unit Jason has, again."
3985462,36441790,2015-06-28,24864195,Yang,Jason's apartment was absolutely spotless and beautiful. My family and I stayed here for 3 nights and had everything we need. Jason was an amazing host and made us feel at home. The neighborhood is quiet and just a short walk from the Charles river.
3985462,37042410,2015-07-04,23245640,Vernon,"Everything about our stay was perfect. Rarely do we encounter better than expected.  The apartment is bright, clean, larger than expected, and located perfectly near Mass Ave (but not too close). All new appliances and fixtures. All new dishes and silverware. Kept like we would do it ourselves.  Our host checked to make sure that we didn't need anything.  All in all, a great place."
3985462,37293618,2015-07-06,19201012,Xiomara,"There aren't enough kind words to describe our wonderful stay. Jason communicated well, tended to every need and then some. The unit is truly beautiful! The pictures do not do it justice. It is very comfortable, well air conditioned, fully equipped and close to many sights. From the this unit we walked to the Charles River, MIT( across bridge), Fenway, and shopping. Jason and Katherine were both Super Duper hosts! Thank you both for a lovely and memorable  4th of July. Enjoyed meeting all of your guests. Highly recommend Jason and would definitely stay there again."
3985462,38292678,2015-07-14,35302798,Lili,Our phenomenal experience with Jason and this property may have completely spoiled us for future Airbnb adventures! This was our very first Airbnb stay and we clearly hit the jackpot.
From our first inquiry to subsequent communication with him,we were bowled over by his professionalism,warmth and unfailing accountability. Prior to our arrival,any questions were promptly answered,adding to our confidence and relaxation re: our week-long stay in Boston.,
His concern for his guests' comfort and enjoyment is genuine and he doesn't miss a beat. He has thought of absolutely every detail to ensure a delightful,restful stay - well-equipped kitchen,wonderfully comfortable bed,lovely linens,"more helpful \"\"visitor/guest\"\" information than a hotel would provide - all thoughtful",invaluable touches. He was 'there' for us if we needed anything
As it was,the apartment could not have been more perfect in all respects. It is exactly as the photos illustrate - spacious,charming,pristine and very tastefully appointed. The beautiful,historic neighborhood - lovely quiet street,convenience and proximity to public transportation & just 2 blocks to the Charles River
And,if you have the good fortune to visit during the summer months,"you will have the opportunity for an unforgettable  afternoon sail around Boston Harbor on Jason's family's beautiful 50' sailing yacht (see \"\"Other Things to Note\"\" at end of  property description). We were lucky",indeed,to have the time to do so,and Jason's father
It must be said that this family takes the art of hospitality to new heights. Our experience transformed our 7-night stay in Boston from a pleasant business-related trip to one that we have raved about ever since and will always treasure...,,,,,

It's in a great location, close to a lot of restaurants, grocery stores, cafes etc. and only a few minutes walk from the nearest subway station. Jason did everything possible to make sure we enjoyed our stay and he was only a text away if we needed anything. I would highly recommend Jason and his Boston apartment and I hope that I will make it back to stay again someday soon. Thank you again, Jason :)"
3985462,46350399,2015-09-09,3150874,John,"Jason’s Back Bay apartment is fantastic. Clean, well maintained, and well run. It was like staying in a hotel suite without the hassle of dealing with staff, check-in and check-out. The location is central and great for anyone that is getting to know the city."
"I travel to Boston for work quite a bit and hope to stay in here again!\"",,,,,
3985462,46794833,2015-09-13,18563059,John,A short one day stay. Very positive experience. Comfortable well equipped apartment in Back Bay. Jason is a very responsive host. Would not hesitate to book here again. Thanks Jason.
3985462,47140316,2015-09-16,26665221,Rebecca,Jason was a wonderful host and the apartment was beautiful and in a wonderful location. Will stay again the next time I'm in Boston!
3985462,47280595,2015-09-17,15276386,Chris,The place was gorgeous and very clean. We were not arriving until after midnight and Jason arranged a lockbox so we could get in. I would highly recommend this place to others. Great back bay location and very convenient to all Boston has to offer.!
3985462,48061404,2015-09-23,14994621,Jennifer,"Jason was very friendly and flexible with our schedule for checking in and out and only a text or phone call away when I had a question. His apartment was the cleanest Airbnb we have ever stayed in. It was well-stocked and had a gorgeous view. This was our family's first time in Boston and between the beauty of the apartment and the charm of Back Bay we fell in love. The bedding was top-notch with the softest sheets I've ever felt. Our little family of 4 fit perfectly in Jason's apartment, there was a queen sized air mattress in the bedroom closet and all the sheets and pillows for it. The kids said it was super comfy."
If you have 2 kids and 2 adults this is the perfect-sized place. Plenty of dishes,the table expands to comfortably seat 4. The living room is very large,so was the bedroom. The bathroom and kitchen were upgraded and designer. You can tell that Jason and his family take pride in their rental,they didn't skimp on anything; everything was high-end. Next time we are in Boston,we will definitely stay in Jason's brownstone.,
We recommend the Indian restaurant around the corner from the apartment,yum! The Marlboro Market is also a great little shoppe with some veggies,fruits,soups,pastas,canned foods
3985462,48218568,2015-09-24,7197165,Randy,"The apartment is fantastic, just as advertised. Jason couldn't be a more responsive or thoughtful host.  This place is a gem.  The neighborhood is quiet but near Fenway and Newbury St. and across the river from MIT.  The apartment is well-appointed, clean and quiet. Can't wait to return."
3985462,48869700,2015-09-29,17236330,Sophie,"We had a great stay at Jason's apartment in Boston. My boyfriend and I were visiting for a short holiday from London. This apartment was clean and very comfortable (the bed is so comfortable its made me hate my bed at home). The apartment is on a quiet but easy to get to road. We spent a lot of time deciding on which area to stay in as our trip was short and we were pleased with our decision to stay in back bay - great shops, easy walk to Fenway, lots of restaurants and easy access to the subway. Jason was very accommodating and gave lots of useful info ahead of our trip and allowed us to store our bags until a late as we had a night flight home which made a huge difference and allowed us to enjoy another full day in the city. The apartment also had everything we needed - towels, hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner etc. It's a no brainier between this and a hotel."
3985462,49076824,2015-09-30,43639680,Rex,Jason went out of his way to make sure we were well taken care of. The room was immaculate. The bed very comfortable. Instructions were clear and the location perfect.

Than you very much Jason !,,,,,

Newly renovated kitchen.  Location is excellent for walking all over Boston!"

3985462,51710311,2015-10-24,32044486,Kyle,"The apartment is walking distance to Newbury Street, which has a lot of shops and restaurants. This makes the apartment perfect for anyone who is staying in Boston. We were also able to walk to Quincy Market because it was such a nice walk."
3985462,52403533,2015-10-29,6094911,Darci,"I had no idea parking would be such a nightmare!  Take advantage of Jason's parking spot, we unfortunately couldn't connect to make it work out."
3985462,53169343,2015-11-06,27777930,Fenella,We had a wonderful time in Boston staying in Jason's beautiful apartment. We spent a week there at the end of October/beginning of November 2015.
The apartment is on the third floor of a lovely old brick building and is immaculately clean and well equipped with everything we could possibly need. The décor is tasteful and the rooms are light and airy but still cosy. We certainly slept soundly in the large,comfortable bed and the bathroom has a great shower. The kitchen area is well equipped with modern appliances,plenty of crockery,cutlery and glassware so we had everything we needed. There is a washing machine and tumble drier downstairs on the ground floor so we were able to do some laundry. You need $1.50 in quarters for each and there is laundry detergent supplied for you. The living room area has a large comfortable sofa with lots of TV channels so we were happy to stay home some evenings. There are also books,board games and fast reliable WiFi access provided.,
The location is excellent in a quiet,leafy,residential street but with shops and bars just a few steps away. The Boston T train is about five minutes walk away so you can travel quickly and easily to wherever you want to go. There is a corner shop where you can pick up supplies and on the other corner is a little bar down some steps that serves great beer and food - the mac and cheese is delicious! There are bigger shops,bars,parks and museums nearby which you can easily walk to or take the T.,
Jason was the perfect host. His communication with us before and during our stay was superb. We had a rental car and he sorted out parking for us - always tricky in Boston. He was incredibly friendly and was on hand to offer advice on everything from sight seeing ideas to great places to eat. Nothing was too much trouble; he made sure we had everything we needed but at the same time he left us to enjoy our holiday as we wanted. It was the perfect balance of being welcoming and super helpful while being non-intrusive and laid back.,,,,,
I don't think there's anything Jason could've done better. Being on the third floor the apartment is up several flights of stairs. This wasn't a problem for us but if you have mobility problems,this might be an issue. Aside from that we found everything about the apartment wonderful; a relaxing haven to return to after a long day sight-seeing and the perfect base to see and do everything we wanted to and more. Maybe for English guests who like drinking tea the addition of an electric 'tea kettle' would've been good but there is a great coffee maker so we didn't mind at all.,,,,
"We absolutely loved our time in this apartment and would come back in a heartbeat! Thanks so much to Jason for everything! \"",,,,,
3985462,53479245,2015-11-09,3547516,Emily,"Like all of the reviews before mine say, Jason's place was great! Exactly as shown in the pictures and very comfortable (feels like home away from home).

The apartment was very clean, comfortable and well appointed and there is a corner store a few doors up which was handy for supplies. Also the apartment is only about a 10 minute cab ride from the airport and only a few minute walk to mind blowing Newbury Street shopping.

Prior to and during my stay, Jason was very communicative and gave me all the info I needed to check in for the stay.  When I arrived, he greeted me in the hallway and made sure I had what I needed.  It was spacious, clean, well stocked and very comfortable.   The kitchen and bathroom have been nicely upgraded.  The location is perfect for walking to Cambridge, or the shops/restaurants on Newbury Street - and the corner market has a lot to offer in terms of food, drinks and snacks.

The Apartment matches the listing perfectly.  Overall its a great place to stay if you want the Back Bay area.  During the last few days of my visit  I had a problem with the heating system, Jason was quick in his response to fix the problem Unfortunately, nothing could be done so without me having to ask, he refunded my remaining days.  That's great service, Thanks Jason."

The apartment is very well-stocked,"with all the kitchen and bathroom essentials that sometimes are forgotten in \"\"vacation rentals\"\"; you could actually cook in the kitchen!  But the location is so good and central I haven't needed to yet",because there are so many restaurants and take-out places within easy walking distance.,,,
This was my first visit in the winter,and the apartment was a comfortable 69 degrees,and I was plenty warm day and night.  The bed is so cozy (with lot of pillows) and I loved curling up on the couch and catching up on some of my shows On Demand.,,,
I most appreciate the security and pleasure of renting with Jason: he is immediately responsive,unfailingly helpful,"and seems to think of every detail.  I can't wait until my next trip to Boston!\"",,,

This apartment is beautifully appointed, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Jason is easy to deal with and very quick to respond to any questions. Definitely recommended"
3985462,68584173,2016-04-05,10513316,Michael,"Jason was a great host and super responsive, and his communication was wonderful. Very clear information on how to get into the apartment, and regular/constant communication by text (and phone if needed).  The apartment itself was a joy, very close to so many services, restaurants, grocery stores, and everything you need for a pleasant stay in the Back Bay area.  Highly recommended host and apartment!"

We stayed in the apt on a rainy day with hot tea and cookies, didn't wanna go out at all when the rain stops. The only downside is that, we were traveling with baby, stroller and 2 heavy large luggages, 3rd floor is bit high and exhausting for me. Will definitely stay here if visiting Boston again."

Most of the hotels were booked so we decided to do AirB&B and I am so glad we did. This apartment worked well for the three of us. The location was easily in walking distance and Jason make checking in a breeze. The restaurant recommendations he made were spot on and the apartment was clean, stylish and very comfortable. Highly recommend."

I was nervous to embark on Airbnb but Jason made it all worth it.  Loved his location, his accommodations, tips, his family that I texted during stay with a question, Couldn't be better."
3985462,79272909,2016-06-12,52252008,Amanda,Jason was a great communicator and offered to help us with anything we needed (which was nothing :)). The place is in a great location . Would definitely stay there again.

3985462,82661935,2016-06-28,61176699,Charleen,"I can't say enough good things about the apartment -- Jason was a fantastic host, even came out to help us with bags, which was much appreciated, and sent us restaurant recommendations before our stay!  The place was super cute, and very quiet, on a really pretty green street (one of my favorites in Back Bay).  The location is convenient, only a few blocks from the T.  Saying that the apartment was clean is an understatement -- it was completely spotless, so much so that our nine-month-old crawling around on the floor didn't get a speck of dust on her.  Jason even provided a Pack and play for our little one.  We would definitely stay here again."
3985462,83679941,2016-07-03,71016892,Christina,"Our stay at Jason's was wonderful, the apartment exactly as pictured, except a nice new couch!  Wonderfully clean and perfectly appointed.  Jason was quickly available when needed, responding right away to a text for a last minute request for parking.  He even moved his own vehicle to accommodate our request.   We will definitely stay again!"

Jason was so easy to work with, and he was always quick to reply to any of my questions.  This listing is spot on, and the kitchen is really nice in case you want to cook a meal or two.  But when staying in Back Bay, and being so close to Fenway, we found ourselves eating out and enjoying everything right out the front door.  No need for a car; we walked, caught the subway, and used Uber for some cross town explorations.  Rental bikes are also close by, but we were traveling with our 8 month old son, so we skipped on those.  The building was very quiet, so our son was able to take naps and sleep through the night without any issue (even on the 4th of July with the fireworks only a block away!).  We stayed for 5 nights, and I wish we could have stayed longer.  Love Boston.  Love this location.  We would highly recommend this place!"

However, we had serious problems interacting with the host, as we were given the wrong key and had additional problems into the apartment, and he was totally absent. Fortunately, Airbnb was very efficient in managing the case and providing support."
3410087,15988406,2014-07-19,17922503,Chimene,"The location was super perfect! Walkable to everything we were hoping for, quiet and safe street. This was a last minute reservation and Bernie was quick to respond and very helpful. On our checkout day we needed a place to keep our luggage before our train departure and he was gracious enough to allow us to leave our things in his office. The studio was very clean and adorable. Lots of character in the building too. First floor location in the rear made it convenient and quiet. We would definitely stay there again if it is available next time we come visit our son in Berklee!"

But Bernie made certain that everything was effortless and even checked in with us periodically to make sure we were having a great time. The studio is in a beautiful location and we loved wandering the tree lined neighborhood, instead of a standard hotel. I definitely would stay there again, and recommend it to anyone who wants a true neighborly feel of Boston, as the building is immensely quiet and Bernie was a wonderful host!"
3410087,17474753,2014-08-12,19138178,Matthew,"The apartment is in a perfect location, close to Boylston Ave and Boston Commons. Its on the first floor which is very convenient if you have luggage. Picking up the keys is easy and Bernie was extremely accommodating.  Perfect apartment for exploring Boston; wifi also works great. If you have a car you might find metered parking a few blocks down or you'll have to use a garage."

The neighborhood was beautiful and super close to Newbury Street and Boston Commons.  It was as clean as a hotel room with fresh towels and soap. It was truly ideal for my trip."
3410087,19372445,2014-09-11,19764913,Amélie,"Ok, the location of this apartment is just perfect. The neighborhood is nice, you can walk everywhere from here. But (and there is a major but), this apartment is really worn (rug, furniture) and dirty to be honest. The sheets and bed were fine and clean but the kitchen and most of all the bathroom/shower felt really dirty. Beside the fact that the shower wasn't clean it also didn't have enough power to rinse your hair properly."
I have to say that this place is too cheap to be true,I would definitely recommend to pay the extra dollars to end up in a cleaner apartment. However,"if you don't mind staying in a \"\"student-like\"\" apartment in the best neighborhood of Boston","than this is your place!\"",,

Be aware that you have to get the key from down the street, a couple blocks away. The host did not respond to our emails prior to our trip, which was disappointing. Overall, it's an okay place but a great location."

We never met Bernie but the office where we collected the key from is nearby and they were able to assist us when we had problems with the internet & heater. The studio has the basic things you need for a short stay in Boston and the neighbourhood feels safe.
3410087,26795797,2015-02-19,8479400,Wylie,Bernie was great!  He was very accommodating with my arrival and departure times.  And he even upgraded me to a nicer apartment because I wanted to check-in slightly early and the original apartment wasn't ready.  I definitely recommend Bernie as a host!
3410087,27575957,2015-03-08,21458966,Sean,Bernie was warm and kind when I met him. He offered me a smaller room at half the price hours before the trip. I gladly took it.

The building is old but the apt looks neat and freshly painted.  We found everything we needed in the apt; the bed was confortable, if we had wanted to cook, which we didn't, there were dishes, pots and pans etc.  Water was hot for showers and soap and shampoo were supplied.  The location was excellent, just a few blocks from Newbury St which is loaded with good restaurants and lots of shops.  Good public transportation is available within a few blocks."

Comfortable bed and sofa, generous closet space, lots of plugs for the electronics. We preferred to eat out so had no need for the tiny stovetop. Only quibble was the lack of a clock radio to serve our NPR addiction."

We called the emergency number and were quickly given another apartment 3 blocks away, twice the size with marvelous views. We were very, very happy with this 2nd apartment. Our only complaint was that there was no air-conditioning, but the ceiling fans helped a lot."
3410087,31933037,2015-05-12,23767169,Nicole,Bernie left keys at a different place than the apartment and we had little interaction even though we emailed him several times. The apartment was as described.

Things that felt shabby: the bed had sheets were not good quality and too small for the mattress. Pillows smelled musty. Wall to wall carpet needs a shampoo.  Moldy dirty shower edges. Heat kicked on the night and there was no way to adjust it."

Lots of good restaurants nearby. I'd recommend Papa Razzi on 159 Newbury.,,,,,
For those travelling from the airport for the cheapest,"simplest and closest public transport route I'd recommend purchasing a 7 cay Charlie card (available from a vending machine near the baggage carousel) for use on the public transport system.  That will also allow you to catch the \"\"Back Bay\"\" bus (just outside the baggage carousels) that runs every 20 minutes from the airport.  The bus stops at Copley Square",then its a flat walk six blocks up and two across. If you just want to catch the bus without purchasing the Charlie card,I think it is $5  with payment via credit card only.,,
Alternative routes are via Silver Line 1 to South Station then taking various connections to Back Bay or Copley but I found the bus far easier.,,,,,

The apartment is well furnished with everything you need including a well supplied kitchenette for longer stays. A bit dated in the bathroom,but if that bothered you,you'd probably be booking a hotel anyhow. Checkin was easy - no sign of Bernie. No city guides in the apt or personal restaurant recommendations that most regular AirBnBer's appreciate so much. He's overly hands off to the point that he is really void of the AirBnB spirt. But that doesn't mean his place isn't worth booking.,,,
PLEASE NOTE:::: There is NO FREE PARKING ANYWHERE CLOSE! And the parking garages are like $40 a night,so if you're diving,I recommend staying elsewhere.,,,
I didn't care for my interaction with Bernie,but had I not had the issue with parking,I probably wouldn't have noticed - or ever interacted with him at all. I mostly didn't like the way he handled it when I asked him for help finding an affordable place to park,"\"\"You didn't tell me you were bringing a car","otherwise I would have told you not to.\"\" - Not exactly helpful when you're stranded with making the choice between paying $40 more per night or spending your entire evening driving around a strange city searching for something cheaper yourself.",
All he needed to do was make the slightest effort to ask around (assuming he even lives in Boston) for a recommended place to park. He made no effort to help me problem solve. All I got was defensive finger pointing that it was my fault for needing to bring a car for work in the first place.,,,,,

3410087,48553608,2015-09-27,41821052,Talia,It would be better if the host could have collected all the trash left by the former guests.
3410087,49346041,2015-10-03,42899641,Paulo,The studio is really very well located and you can go walking to all the tourist attractions. It was very easy to pick up and return the keys. One thing that could be improved is the cleanliness.
3410087,49992763,2015-10-08,19581496,Marissa,"Great location, bigger than expected, and had everything you will need! Walking distance to literally everywhere we visited (Cambridge, North end, plus shopping/restaurants on Newbury just a quick walk away). Didn't use the kitchen (too many great restaurants) but looked to have all the essentials. Very easy key pickup, so everything was convenient."
3410087,50656278,2015-10-13,8823848,Erin,"I'm not really sure where to start. Before going into detail, I'll provide the bird's eye view of my experience. Despite this studio being slightly more expensive than others, we were really excited about this place due to the reviews, location and the photos. However, the owner never responded to our calls/emails/texts, the studio was unclean when we arrived, had bad towels and sheets, noisy and my fiancé and I ended up just buying a hotel the last night to have somewhere nice to sleep (even though we had already paid for this Airbnb)."
When we arrived,Bernie was unresponsive and a local neighbor/Bed and Breakfast had to track him down to get us keys.  When we finally got inside the studio,we noticed it wasn't cleaned from the previous tenants - full trash cans,towels on the floor,dirty bedsheets and loose hair everywhere.  Since I couldn't get a hold of Bernie,the local Bed and Breakfast (not associated with Airbnb) put my fiancé and I up for a few nights until the place could get cleaned.  I think they either managed Bernie's property
We stayed at Bernie's studio the last two nights of our five day trip (after three nights at the B&B). The place was (finally) cleaned nicely but we were still unsatisfied. The photos didn't do it justice. The sheets were about a 2 thread count and we had to cover the pillow cases with our t-shirts so they wouldn't scratch our faces while we slept. Plus,the comforter had weird stains on it. After one night there,we decided to scratch the studio and bought a hotel down the street to have a great place to sleep on our final night.,,,
I was disappointed because I never felt like I wanted to spend time in the place we rented.,,,,,
We were told that due to the uncleanliness of the room when we arrived,our first night would be free (that is what the nice people at the B&B told us).  I still haven't seen a refund.,,,,
I have still never spoken to Bernie.,,,,,
If I learned anything from my stay here,it's to ALWAYS get the Airbnb insurance. You never know what you're going to walk into.,,,,

I came back once to the studio to find the door wide open and two men installing the AC. Granted it was a hot week and they were installing it for our convenience,but I was not informed about this.

This studio is just a block away, so no excuse for skipping a morning workout! An accurately described spot in an A+ neigborhood.

I was a little confused with how to check in and get the keys as this was my first Airbnb experience but I called the number listed and they told me what to do. Key pickup/drop off was very close to apartment, within walking distance. We drove so we knew parking would be a little rough. There is not free parking which caught me by surprise but only because Boston does resident permit street parking which I can absolutely respect. We parked at a lot on Newbury St. Double parked to unload, dropped off car, walked back. No hassle. It did cost $126 for 3 days so if that doesn't work for you, don't drive. This also gave us a chance to check out all Newbury St had to offer: shopping, restaurants, coffee houses, etc. The studio itself was very clean, you can smell the \"\"clean\"\" in the air when you walked in. It's actually a little bigger than it looked in the pictures which is great. I would absolutely stay here again. Beautiful studio in a gorgeous neighborhood"

When booking this apartment we read the reviews posted and after staying there I can't believe how highly it was recommended. The apartment wasn't a clean as desired, the front entrance smelt like cat pee, the shower didn't drain properly, the air conditioning unit (though efficient) was incredibly noisy and left our throats sore and the apartment incredibly dry. The sheets were uncomfortable and had a blood stain on them, the pillows (only 2) were small and uncomfortable, as was the bed. The remote for the tv didn't work and was covered in batter acid."
For almost $300 a night this was ridiculous!! When we were booking it was the least expensive option,after 2 uncomfortable and unhappy nights in this air bnb we looked at hotel options in the area and the prices were lower and almost certainly much nicer and cleaner. Had there been an option to get our money back from this listing we would have moved to a hotel in a heart beat (even if it was at a higher rate). Since we had already wasted so much money on this accommodation we couldn't justify paying for somewhere else and instead didn't spend any time,other than sleeping,at the air bnb.,,
I will say that the location was perfect,very close to Newbury street with great shops and restaurants,and very accessible for transit. However,there were many other hotels in the area that would have been a far better option.,,
Bernie was good at responding to messages fairly quickly and did give us an option to pick up our keys later than expected when our flight was delayed. However,picking up the keys at a separate location wasn't ideal with all of our luggage.,,,,
I have had some great experiences with air bnb,and at far lower costs,this experience was a big let down.,,,

The downstairs room is really spacious that can allow me and my parents to stay. Brand new house plus two extremely friendly and thoughtful hosts make us feel like home. Danielle even provides a heater in case it is too cold. Also, there is a cute and quiet dog at home. Hence, I would highly recommend their place if you wanna tour Boston for a couple of days."

I went with them to check in, and the space was beautiful.  Everything was clean, the space was actually larger than expected, and there is even a private entrance, which proved useful to my wedding party-goers."
Danielle and Peder are incredibly nice and have an adorable daughter and dog,and my group told me that everything was perfect.  The bed was even memory foam,and the futon was very comfortable as well.

My boyfriend and I were lucky to occupy their room during 4th of July weekend. Danielle & Peder has a beautiful place!  On arrival we met Peder who showed us to our room, explained the house rules, and pointed out there were recommendation sheets (Really liked this!) and tea if needed. Their place is close to the T station, but we took an Uber, which was less than ten dollars to Boston Proper. Their neighborhood was pleasant and we enjoyed exploring it. We even saw fireworks on our way back home. Although we didn't have many interactions with Danielle & Peder -  they were nothing but kind and courteous.

The Airbnb was equally fantastic. We stayed for quite a while (2 weeks),but their basement studio was very comfortable and contained everything we needed for our stay. There was plenty of room for all 4 of us,and it is totally family-friendly. Great location between the Orange line (Stonybrook stop) with its related parks,and Washington Street. A lovely neighborhood (Jamaica Plain is pretty sweet).,,

The Location- Their place is a cheap Uber ride into the city (and also close to the T, if you prefer that method of transportation). The Room- Private entrance through the backyard to the basement room; we had 3 people staying, and it was plenty spacious for us; we had a minor issue with the toilet, but Danielle & Peder addressed it immediately; an awesome little backyard for you to have your coffee or chill in the hammock.  Great couple, super nice, and highly recommend!"

6730758,89745319,2016-07-29,32690597,Maureen,Danielle & Peder were great hosts! This was my first Airbnb experience and I would stay there again.  I stayed 5 nights as I needed to commute to Northeastern U for school.  Their space is just a short walk through the park to the orange line and NEU is 3 stops.  The private studio is in their basement with your own entrance through bilco doors in the backyard and I used the front door too.  I loved having a separated area to relax and eat away from the bed and sleeping.  They were very flexible with check in and check out which was much appreciated.  I needed an umbrella too so they are very helpful and willing to offer you anything.  Thanks again!!
6730758,90977208,2016-08-03,80191345,Ann,We had a lovely stay at Danielle&Peder's house.  The Jamaica Plain neighborhood has great places to eat within walking distance and access to the metro into downtown Boston couldn't be easier!
6730758,92930989,2016-08-10,73835885,Nanette,This studio was perfect for our week in Boston. This listing is absolutely true to the pictures.  Danielle and Peder were very accommodating. Heartily recommend.

The house is close by to loads of things to eat and drink. They do have 3 dogs, but there are no hassle whatsoever. I came and went as I pleased and was able to park outside the front of the house for ease."
7693009,50354993,2015-10-11,45087844,Denice,Ame and Chris were very flexible with my check-in time. Chris even met me at the T station since it was late at night when I finally got there.
My room was welcoming with restful decor,a  vase of white roses,a clean towel,some books,and a pitcher of water. That queen-size bed was even more comfortable than mine at home! A nice fluffy comforter and just-right pillows. I slept great. Even though they have 3 dogs the house does not smell like dog at all. Everything was fresh and clean.,
The neighborhood is fantastic; a laid-back vibe with good restaurants and shopping. I bought a hat at a real millinery shop,and a framed tapestry at a resale store. The local coffee shop has a pastry chef that is not to be believed.,,,,

The house felt like it was straight out of an Anthropologie catalog--charming in interesting ways, with the smallest details highly curated. The bed was comfy. The room felt like a birch forest. The dogs are all very well behaved and super friendly."
This neighborhood is up and coming for Boston. The apartment is a 5 minute walk from the Green St T,and it's just a few minutes from JP Pond and the corridor (for runners and bikers). Good food in the neighborhood too.,,,,

(Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to meet the wonderful Ame as she was out of town) He was able to accommodate my early morning arrival which was much appreciated. Their home looks like it's straight off HGTV--it's beautifully decorated and looks exactly like the pictures. The bed in the guest room is one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Staying at Chris & Ame's home was my first Airbnb experience; initially I was nervous but my nerves  quickly faded once Chris warmly welcomed me and I realized that what's advertised is exactly what I got. They live approximately 3 minutes (walking) from the T station and close to lots of little stores/restaurants/coffee shops to take advantage of. The Wagging Welcoming Committee (their 3 dogs) are so lovely! It was refreshing to come in the house and have them gently greet me. They're all very well-behaved and don't go into the guest room. If I'm back in Boston and need a place to stay, I will certainly look to see if Chris & Ame's home is available. Overall, I would highly recommend this \"\"Sweet quiet room in JP condo!!\"\" \""

They had excellent suggestions for food and things to do around their neighborhood as well as all over Boston, which a the 5 minute walk to the T stop (subway) can get you everywhere. The dogs were very well behaved and welcomed any attention you wanted to give. I would definitely stay here again."
7693009,87792760,2016-07-21,33249724,Agnes,"Ame and Chris are incredibly accomodating hosts. They answered questions really fats, the communication before we arrived was smooth and helpful. Their apartment is spotlessly clean, and furnished with  new furniture  and an obviously discerning artistic taste. The guest room is comfortable, quiet and the bed was excellent too. We drove a car, and it was easy to find parking right in front of the house. As for the neighborhood: Jamaica Plain is colorful and vibrant. There are small stores and cafes interspaced with Victorian houses. Some are more weathered, but young people started moving into the neighborhood, and  now quite a few of the houses are beautifully renovated. We felt very safe living here and are glad we chose this part of Boston, as it is a mere 10 minute metro ride from downtown, but has charm and personality, and is not touristy at all!"

Both Azize and Vivian were both super welcoming. Azize took time out of his day to show me parts of Boston that he knew I would be interested in seeing,being a software developer in the start-up industry.,,,,
The apartment and the surrounding environment was as described,very short walk to various tourist attractions/public transport stops. I enjoyed multiple casual walks to the Boston Harbor.,,,,
The amenities in the apartment are great as well,if I would've shown up with nothing,I would've still been able to live comfortably.,,,
tl;dr: Azize and Vivian went out of their way to make my stay and trip as comfortable as possible and were extremely successful.,,,,,

It was a very hot weekend, but the AC was very efficient (we were pleasantly surprised knowing that it was an older building). The elevator does take some patience, but ultimately did the job. Azize and Vivian were very nice and incredibly informative about the apartment/building and area. Ideal AirBnb hosts, and the kind of people I'd hope to interact with every time we stay somewhere. We would definitely stay at their place again."

He stayed in touch the whole time in case we needed anything. The apartment had all the essentials, shampoo, conditioner, soap, dishes, snacks and more.

The house has all the amenities that you would expect at a hotel that cost 4 times as much: TV in the room, WI-FI, fresh, plush, clean towels, a kitchen with everything you would need to cook a meal (which I did several times) etc. She is also very gracious and cares about the people that come and stay.

It's in a good location, close to supermarkets and transport. The bedroom was clean but the bathroom could have been cleaner. The kitchen is tiny but sufficient for cooking simple meals.

I had a hotel reservation that fell through at the last minute and Mona was able to set me up for the weekend in a matter of hours. She was out of town during my stay so I had the flat to myself and all of the conveniences that go along with it (never underestimate having a kitchen). You could easily spend a whole lot more and get a whole lot less in Boston."

Her place is like a cozy, comfortable, artistic place with full of interesting objects, and it feels very comfortable maybe because we are also artists like Mona. We used the entire 1 bedroom condo for the weekend, and it was spacious enough for 2 people. There's another big couch, which you could use as a bed. A fully equipped kitchen was also nice to cook some quick food. B green line is right in front of the door, so it was very convenient to commute to downtown."
Only minor thing we would point out as downside was that there were many dusts at each corners of the rooms,and it feels like the place is not super clean. but we didn't mind. If you are a super super clean person,you might want to know about it in advance,"but for me and my husband it was totally okay.  \"",,
1185034,13208986,2014-05-22,1019850,Dona,Four of us (2 couples) had the whole place to ourselves. We thought the apt was better than it looks in the pictures. It was also larger than I thought it would be (pictures make it look smaller and less interesting than it is). The apartment is what I would describe as a 1 bedroom rather than a studio. Location was superb as we were in Boston for an event at Boston College (walking distance). Mona was great to communicate with.

The house was neat and tidy and was as described.  It was a little dark but I imagine that was because of the weather outside (rainy).

Mona was my first AB&B host and she was very ready for her guests. The rooms (being small in the city) were comfortable and clean. Mona met us on-time,showed us what we needed to know,gave us our key & alarm code and telephone numbers and turned the condo over to us. We didn't stay there too long because we needed to be in Boston for a concert. Mona's house was within walking distance to the train and off we went. The people of Boston were so gracious and hospitable. We walked for miles and never felt threatened or afraid to ask questions (mostly about transportation). Getting back to Mona's house very late was no problem. The building was dead quiet when we got back and we made it a point not to disturb the neighbors. Because it is a large apartment building we heard neighbors getting out for work early Friday morning,but it was normal apartment living and did not bother us. Because we were in a large college town parking was tricky. Mona said summertime was the best time to find open parking spots and after on 20 minutes we found a good and safe spot on a side street near by. Be sure to follow the no parking signs seriously,my niece wasn't so lucky when she had her car towed for parking in a spot without a resident permit,"so give yourself some extra time and patience to find a legal spot. \""

1185034,70691197,2016-04-19,59397951,Marcia,This place worked great for us during the Boston Marathon.  The location was perfect - right on the subway routes.  The host was very easy to work with and clear even though we never met her.
1185034,74510148,2016-05-15,63653651,Cynthia,"Comfy! Great location! Thanks, Mona!"
1631942,12114404,2014-04-23,7896592,Carrie,"This apartment was incredible!  The space was immaculately clean, the owners left a page full of tips and instructions, and the key pick up and drop off was very easy.  They left a gift card for the local coffee shop since they don't have a coffee maker and a Charlie card for riding the T.  How sweet is that?  We immediately felt at home in this space; plenty of room for a group of 3 or a group of two couples if a pair of you are okay with sleeping in the loft area.  Great back deck.  It is on the third floor of the building, so you have to be able to go up a few flights of stairs.  It is an absolutely perfect location.  Very nice and safe neighborhood.  Lots of great restaurants, shops, groceries, etc. in the JP neighborhood just minutes away.  Very easy to navigate and use the T from this location if you want to get to other parts of the city.  We were there for the Boston Marathon and it was really nice to be just a little bit removed from all the race madness.  We took the T that morning to get on the athlete buses no problem, and my friend's mom who came to watch got to where she wanted to be on race day easily as well.  We just can't say enough good things about the space and the owners.  Without a doubt we will be back!  Thank you, Jenn and Paul!"

The house is extremely clean, tastefully designed and in a wonderful neighborhood with lots of restaurants, pubs and grocery stores nearby. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We highly recommend them."
1631942,20391285,2014-09-28,21633724,Ralph,"The penthouse was actually nicer than the photos & very clean. Since the weather was great, we were able to use the rooftop deck. The Orange line was a 10 minute walk then a short ride into Boston. The neighborhood was fun for walking and had several great choices for dinner. We'd recommend but note there is no coffee maker or microwave."
1631942,21131703,2014-10-12,19161139,Sarah,Stayed for a weekend in this apartment. Jenn was very accommodating allowing me to pick up the keys earlier and also allowing a last minute guest to stay.  She was also very communicative in the lead up and throughout my stay ensuring everything was going well.
The main bedroom is a good size and sleeps two comfortably. However the loft takes a bit of guts - the ladder in the picture looks like it could be at an angle,in reality it's right against the wall so you are scaling the wall to get to the top - when you're up there you'll find a fold out bed with no barrier at the top. Bravery required!,,,,
The kitchen is really well fitted out with everything you need. The remainder of the pictures are as they appear on the listing - great bathroom,lots of light in the apt,extremely clean etc.,,,
The location is very central. This is ideal for a quiet couple or two friends who are planning to be out a lot. There are thin walls and young children downstairs - the noise travels both ways so something to be mindful of when planning your trip.,,,,,
"I would recommend this apt and Jenn as a host.  \"",,,,,
1631942,22562790,2014-11-09,23145885,Natalia,Jenn was a great host and was available for any questions or concerns I would have.  The space is absolutely comfortable and welcoming.  The apt is on a quiet street so a good night's sleep is pretty much guaranteed.  But you are less than a 5 minute walk from a bunch of restaurants and hang outs if you are looking for a fun night shenanigans.  I would definitely make this my go-to place when visiting Boston.

Jenn and Paul were gracious hosts, and their apartment was a great base for our six days in Boston.  The rooms are spacious, well-lit, comfortable and incredibly clean.  The location was perfect.  The apartment was quiet, but the shops and restaurants on Centre Street and public transportation were close by.  We chose the neighborhood to be near friends and thoroughly enjoyed the JP community.  One hint -- it's easier to carry luggage, groceries, etc. up and down the back stairway to the third floor deck.  Enjoy!"
1631942,46817697,2015-09-13,13007602,Henry,"Jenn and Paul have a delightful home, and it was a pleasure staying there. Very neat, tidy and comfortable...and absolutely immaculate. The unit is very well equipped, with lots of free parking and only a short block from Centre Street, with tons of restaurants and stores. We loved it, and would definitely consider it in the future. Jenn and Paul were very welcoming, and left clear directions and recommendations for dining. They were easy to contact and promptly responded to messages."
1631942,62646979,2016-02-15,31720625,Bradley,"Jenn was absolutely pleasant to interact with up to and through our stay. The place was nicely decorated and everything was clean and welcoming upon arrival. Street parking was free and easy for the weekend, the neighborhood had plenty to offer if going into Boston isn't on the to-do list, and the subway was only a short walk away. Would definitely stay here again."
1631942,70612870,2016-04-19,5723041,Alex,"Jenn was great! Very helpful and organized host. We really enjoyed the space, especially the large balcony. It gets perfect sun in the afternoon. We'll definitely stay here for the marathon next year if it's available. Thanks, Jenn!"
1631942,74623585,2016-05-16,5165585,Lila,"Jenn was an amazing host and her apartment is by far the best Airbnb I've seen yet. The apartment was spacious and clean, the kitchen was perfect for making meals, and the porch was absolutely perfect for enjoying a spring day in the sunshine of Boston. We were able to use the grill to make burgers and watch movies at night on their TV. Wifi worked excellent and the bed was very comfortable. Also, Jenn was incredibly friendly and communicative. Whenever we had questions, she would respond immediately. We had a fantastic experience and I would go back in a heartbeat."
1631942,77323374,2016-05-31,28576081,Cody,"This was one of my favorite Airbnb experiences so far. Jenn was out of town, but even though she was away she remained in touch with me regularly to ensure that my partner and I were having a comfortable stay. Her guest book and the household instructions she left were thoughtful and specific and contained suggestions on where to dine. And her penthouse with its accompanying patio were indescribably gorgeous - it felt like home. I highly recommend Jenn to Airbnb-ers looking for a central and comfortable stay in Boston that's central to shops and restaurants and an easy commute to town. I hope she'll have us again the next time we're in the area!"
1631942,80831646,2016-06-20,1668429,Kelly,"Jenn and Paul's place is fantastic. It is a pristinely clean, nicely decorated apartment with a great deck amongst tall trees. We enjoyed breakfast on the deck every day of our stay. The apartment is only one block off of one of the main streets with coffee shops and restaurants in the quiet, residential town of Jamaica Plain. It is very easy to get around on foot. I would definitely recommend this apartment. The only caution would be if a person had accessibility issues, as the apartment is a 3rd floor walk up."
1631942,82202029,2016-06-26,11313983,Lauren & Chris,"My husband and I had the most wonderful stay at Jenn and Paul's penthouse! The apartment is spotlessly clean and absolutely beautiful, with a huge deck that is heaven on a sunny day. I used to live in Jamaica Plain and could not imagine a more perfectly situated place. It was right by all the great shops and restaurants along Centre Street and minutes to Jamaica Pond for an early morning run or an evening stroll. Jenn was so nice and communicative throughout and her neighborhood guide was thoughtful and thorough. We couldn’t be happier with our trip and would love to return some day!"
1631942,87920301,2016-07-22,23236773,Rick And Donna,"Lovely space, clean, convenient to Boston downtown, wonderful local neighborhood with shops and restaurants. Jenn was a great host too!"

1631942,98316228,2016-08-30,18831445,Tripp,"Amazing, seriously.  Location can not be beat as you are steps from the main drag in JP as well as the beautiful pond.  If you like walking (which I do), you are close enough to stroll to Fenway and Roslindale.  City bikes are near by and make longer journeys easy as well.  Everything was immaculately clean and check-in/check-out was a snap.  The host even left us coffee/wine/food to enjoy."
9577988,55767043,2015-12-05,45914466,Antoine,Gerald is very Helpful. It's a clean and nice place not far from the public transport.

9577988,61113749,2016-01-31,36217620,Isabelle,Kind welcome from Gerald even though we booked last minute as our plans changed and had to get close to Boston. This location is 5 mn from Boston downtown!!!! This house in JP (Jamaica Plain) very peaceful and the neighborhoods too. The place is as described and Gerald and his wonderful wife are improving this new home.They are very responsive if anything (URL HIDDEN) has beautiful parks and there is a Whole Food Market very close by walking. Easy to park on premises if you have a car; very convenient! We warmly recommend this place and family.

It's on a quiet dead-end street-- a bonus given the proximity to JP's main street. Also a short walk to Jamaica Pond for those looking for running/walking paths."
The hosts are very accommodating. We needed extra beds and were supplied with them,"no problem. I will definitely book again!\"",,,,

9577988,66445628,2016-03-22,12264316,Jesse,Gerald's space was a great place to start our Boston adventure from. My guests and I were very happy with this large space in such a great area and really let us spread out and have our own space. It was a quick walk or bus to two major transit lines which made it the perfect place to start our day from. As a bonus there was great restaurants and a killer pub within walking distance as well as a Whole Foods and a CVS to grab the basics or things you may have forgotten.

He even gave us a nice bottle of wine as a welcome present and lent us extra umbrellas one day when it was going to rain! The appartment is big, has a lot of charm, and had everything we needed to cook and eat meals for five people. The neighbourhood has a lot of charm as well, with many beautiful houses around, and is very quiet.

The apartment looks just like the photos, 3 beds was perfect since we had 3 people. The apartment was roughly 20 minute by taxi from everywhere we wanted to go in Boston and only 10ish from Fenway park so getting around was easy. The one and only complaint we had was that the walls are very thin and they live above the unit we so could hear everything and got woken up early from noise/footsteps above us. Everything else was great and he and his wife were very nice!"

3276286,39813081,2015-07-26,7556939,Stefan,"The rental was very clean and the bed I slept in was very comfortable. Rail transportation was very close by, grocery stores, the Sam Adams brewery (with a free tour including a few complimentary beers and a free souvenir glass) and other pubs/restaurants were all in walking distance."
"The best part of this property was the back patio with a gas grill. My friends and I grilled and hung out there before heading out on the town both nights we stayed.\"",,,,,
3276286,40587703,2015-08-01,6446609,Jill,"This is a very pleasant apartment in a very quiet location with public transport just down the road. There is a great café at the end of the road and some interesting restaurants on Centre Street in Jamaica Plains which is about a 15 minutes walk from the house. We stayed only a couple of nights, but we had a very pleasant time."
3276286,41188154,2015-08-05,23793317,Bruce,"Balint's place is clean, furnished with newer furniture, and quite ( there is an upstairs neighbor). His description is accurate. Our experience was that the dryer was difficult to operate due to the broken switch ( but he had a set of tools that made it possible) and turning the hot water valve under the kitchen was inconvenient. There was no direct contact with him as everything is through notes and lock boxes. Recommended!"
3276286,41334430,2015-08-07,32254045,Vincent,"Belle location, proche du métro et avec parking facile et gratuit dans la rue. Logement conforme à la description, spacieux et très agréable à vivre. On a beaucoup apprécié les 2 jours passés à Boston"
3276286,42110487,2015-08-11,497654,LeslieJulien,"We had a very great time at Balint place. The apartment is nice, clean, functional, lot of space and light, and very well equiped. There is a metro station down the road which make this place really convenient to go downtown. Communication with Balint was easy. We recommand!"
3276286,42243299,2015-08-11,25997229,Elisabeth,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3276286,43972024,2015-08-23,34857887,Michel,"We were very pleased with the apartment. Balint was prompt to reply to our queries and helpful. The apartment is ideally located in Jamaïca plain, a Boston's neighborhood home to many latinos. It was fun and safe. It takes less than 30 min to go to Downtown Crossing (Orange T line). We definitively enjoyed our time there!"
3276286,55806414,2015-12-06,47173889,Emre,"Balint was a great host, always reachable and helped a lot during booking and after moving in. We needed an iron and he bought us one before our arrival, appreciated that a lot. About the neighborhood, it's a lovely place, green and quiet. House has an upstairs neighbor, but we didn't hear a noise. House was like pictured and neat. Being close to public transportation was great for us. Only thing, kitchen tools didn't seem that clean, just old maybe. And if you're coming from a warm climate to the Boston winter, you might consider taking extra blankets."
3276286,57867770,2015-12-30,14676421,Oksana,In general place looks spacious & true to photos.
We had some problems with the front door lock - it was tricky to open sometimes,though I don't think it's broken & we didn't report this issue to Balint during our stay (we were really busy).,,,,
If you care about the internet connection speed,the wifi in the apartment may seem rather slow,getting even a bit worse at mornings. There's no TV & landline phone (I don't think that's a big issue anyway but just fyi :).,,,
We were only 3 persons staying in the house,I guess if you are more than 4 you may feel some lack of privacy. Living room is divided from the other bedroom with thin wall which has a connecting window to the kitchen (covered with blinds) on one side & decorative screen on the other.,,,,
We were using a car to get to city center,it takes about approx 15 mins. We were always able to find parking place on the streets really close to the apartment.,,,,
The neighborhood looks fine & really pretty,but we had to drive around to find grocery store & coffee shops,the area might seem a little empty at times.,,,
Washing machine works perfectly.,,,,,
"I have positive impression about our stay but I wouldn't call the place \"\"luxury\"\" though :D\"",,,,,
3276286,66026713,2016-03-19,48273952,Spencer,"My roommate and I enjoyed living in Balint's JP apartment while we were completing internships in downtown Boston. The apartment is very well-located if you want to avoid the commotion of downtown but also be within short walking distance of a T station, a gym, a restaurant, two cafes, a brewery, and a small market. Jamaica Plain more generally is a very cool neighborhood. You can get to downtown Boston in under 20 minutes via the orange line stop on Green Street. The apartment itself is very spacious with great furniture. A few considerations that will likely not matter if you are staying for a short time but might pose difficulties if you are planning a long-term stay: the wifi in the apartment is incredibly slow (and stopped working entirely for a short time period), the refrigerator leaks frequently (I'd recommend putting an empty water jug under the dripping then emptying it occasionally), and the kitchen has plenty of pots and pans but no measuring cups, measuring spoons, ice trays, or blender, so plan to bring your own if you'll be cooking a lot. Otherwise, living in Balint's apartment was a great experience and he was very helpful and quick to communicate. I definitely recommend the apartment, especially for short-term stays!"
3276286,68357035,2016-04-04,31919096,Russell,"We didn't get to meet Balint, but this was not a problem as all was organised and left for us. The house is on two floors with two bathroom facilities. Getting the key was simple and straight forward. Uber taxis form Balint's place to the centre were inexpensive and we found an excellent 'brewery' around the corner in which to have our evening meals. The apartment is very clean, well kept and perfect for a stay in Boston. It made the perfect start to our traveling holiday around the East Coast!"
3276286,71268840,2016-04-24,60423400,Robert,"The host was quite responsive, and reservations and check in were very smooth. The apartment has an unusual lay-out. The dining room has been converted to a bedroom with a Japanese screen for a door. The master bedroom is in the basement and only has a half-bath.  The furnishings were mostly from Ikea, but ok except for the master bedroom mattress which was impossibly hard and uncomfortable. My daughter lives in the neighborhood, which is an up and coming hipster area with plenty of restaurants and close to the arboretum and zoo, but at least a half hour subway ride from downtown, so not especially good for sight-seers."
3276286,73254235,2016-05-07,873557,Jennifer,Balint's place was exactly as described. Communication was easy and we had everything we needed for a great stay! Thanks Balint!
3276286,75086322,2016-05-18,45233510,Sayyeda,This condo was a beautiful place and perfect for our stay. Balint was easily accessible via text which made our stay easier. Thanks!
3276286,77015737,2016-05-30,16519431,Tim,We really liked the Place and recommend it. Parking was really easy in front on street. We're a family with four and found it suited our needs. Its very comfortable nicely decorated. It's worth noting that the bedrooms are on separate floors and one of the rooms uses a screen instead of a wall and is also open at the top so there is a slight lack of privacy.
3276286,81572571,2016-06-23,44810220,Owen,This is a convenient place to stay. 5 minutes walk to the Green Street train station. The apartment was clean and neat when we arrived.
The basement is the main bedroom,but be aware that the mattress is like sleep on a wooden slab,very hard.,,,
The fridge has a leak inside,but there is a plastic tub in it to catch the water.,,,,
The Wi Fi was good for the first 24 hours and then stopped working; advising of an account issue,so we sent a text to Balint but received no reply. Later found out he had sent an email,but without the connection we could not receive it.,,,
"We would rate this as a 3 and a half star property.\"",,,,,
3276286,83162037,2016-07-01,47642073,Jonny,The flat was exactly as described. Very neat and tidy when we arrived for a 5 night stay. It's in an great location in JP. Ideal for exploring Boston when not staying bang in the centre. We had an issue with the wifi but our host managed to get it sorted after a couple of days. Communication was decent. Cheers!
3276286,84225695,2016-07-06,30523752,Grace,"We had a good time at Balint's place! Beds were comfy, there was washer dryer which was very convenient and useful. With 5 people, one and a half bath was good but took a bit of time. Nice neighborhood, 5 mins walk to orange line which goes close to most of the tourist attractions. Having said that, wifi can be a bit slow and some may find airconditioning set at min of 75 F slightly warm. Balint was a good host."
3276286,93438591,2016-08-12,26992019,Declan,"Great place/host/location. The apartment is spacious and clean and has all the amenities required for a long or short stay. We (family of 4, 2 young boys aged 6 and 4) stayed for over 5 weeks. the local parks were good. the locals were friendly and street parking was good most of the time. easy to get downtown on the T. it can be noisy (Street noise, neighbours banging around and the water system in the building is very loud especially in the downstairs bedroom) but that's apartments in the city for you. The stairs are a little dangerous for the younger ones as they're steep with no handrails."
"Balint was quick to respond by email and very accommodating. I would recommend staying here.\"",,,,,
3276286,94089392,2016-08-14,60811716,Alyssa,"The apartment was wonderful. All of the necessities were provided to us and we had everything we needed. Exactly as pictured, although the layout was a bit abnormal but this was not an issue whatsoever for us. On a cute little side street in JP, just a 15-20 minute cab ride from the city! Exactly what we needed."
3276286,95208226,2016-08-18,69643937,Stefania,"The apartment was really big and only 5 minutes walk from the metro station nearby. We didn't have the pleasure to meet Balint, but it was really easy to comunicate with Him. The Neighborhood is really quite."
3276286,96127702,2016-08-21,55781416,Hannah,Great stay here!
3276286,99726990,2016-09-05,31594460,Eric,"The listing was accurate. We arrived in early morning after a red-eye flight so being able to check in and get rest was very important. The apartment is quiet, peaceful and full with natural lights.  The host is very considerate (plenty of tea bags, coffee, etc.) and made our stay a very pleasant one. We highly recommend this place to other family travelers."
6576530,42795355,2015-08-15,12017680,Parker,"Aihua was a gracious host. Our original AirBNB reservation got cancelled last minute, as that location had burned down in a fire.... So it was great that she took the 11 of us in."
The location is good,it's in Dorchester,and walking distance to a supermarket and liquor store. It's close to the main roadways to get into downtown Boston.,,,
The unit is large - there's the basement portion (with a kitchen,eating area,and Master Bathroom),and the 1st floor area with a TV room and 2 bedrooms and a bathroom.,,
The furniture is top quality,the beds are very good,and the layout is very good. The 1st floor TV has cable. Fantastic washer dryer set up. The internet was great and reliable. There is a full BBQ grill outside which we used everyday. AWESOME.,,,
There is very good parking - although one needs to know how to drive in TIGHT conditions as the driveway has a gate with pillars - and the entrance is a hill. Again,if you're a decent driver,you can do it - you'll probably need to put it in reverse to change your angle each time you enter/ exit.,,,
The kitchen accessories were to sparse,and is the only area of the house that needs to be improved. The knives are only ok,there were not enough pots (she lent us one of hers),and we ended up washing everything BEFORE we used it,as they weren't clean enough. There were not enough garbage cans / recycle buckets outside.,
I'd definitely stay again,and think that the minor inconveniences in the kitchen are understandable of a great house,which gets used a lot.,,,
"Thank Aihua! I'll be back.\"",,,,,
6576530,46394719,2015-09-10,40263769,Mohamed S,"Aihua was nice and helpful, easy host and welling to help us."

6576530,50038154,2015-10-08,29951487,Jürgen,"Aihua war eine sehr freundliche, aufgeschlossene und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin."
Als die Heizung nicht funktionierte (es waren wohl die ersten kalten Tage) war sie sofort da und sehr bemüht bis alles ok war.,,,,,
Die Wohnung war innen wie beschrieben,wir fühlten uns sofort wohl.,,,,
Die Raumaufteilung war sehr gut (auch für 6 Personen) und die Lage sehr ruhig.,,,,,
Im großen und ganzen war alles sauber.,,,,,
Wir können die Wohnung guten Gewissen weiter empfehlen.,,,,,

6576530,67293006,2016-03-28,61458247,Njie,"The house was pretty great, first we didn't know how to work the heater but the owner was very quick to help us figure it out. The neighborhood, however, looked very sketchy. Although we didn't run into any problems, the cops kept patrolling because it was unsafe."
6640662,58564858,2016-01-03,10567841,Richie,"Our stay in Boston an in this house was amazing the house was beautifully presented and Danielle was so nice, leaving us welcome gifts and sights to see in Boston. Would highly recommend staying here!"
3069104,33305218,2015-05-26,32785401,Kari,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was great! Courtney and Martine were very responsive, flexible with our check-in and check-out times, and extremely hospitable.  They provided helpful directions to their apartment from the airport, which was conveniently located just 2 blocks from the T stop on a picturesque street that made you feel you had gone back in time.  Getting key was hassle-free. Apartment was exactly as advertised, no surprises.  C&M were nice enough to leave us some local brews and a nice note to welcome us to Boston. They also provided an incredible list of restaurants all around Boston to ensure we ate well no matter where we were. It was such a joy being able to experience the city from a local's perspective.  At the end of a long day of sightseeing, C&M's apartment was very comfortable and we slept like babies in their memory foam bed.  The neighborhood around the apartment is a dream. High-end, historic 1800s homes on narrow cobblestone streets lined with gas lanterns."
To summarize,the best parts about staying at Courtney's apartment were:,,,,
1) Location. Super easy to get to/from the airport. Centrally located to see everything there is to see in Boston. Absolutely beautiful neighborhood.,,,,,
2) Courtney and Martine's hospitality. Easy communications,helpful directions to get to their apartment,awesome list of recommendations for restaurants and things to see in Boston.,,,
3) The bed. So very comfortable. The most important part about accommodations while away from home,in my opinion.,,,,
"Would definitely recommend their apartment to friends or family traveling to Boston.\"",,,,,
3069104,33863328,2015-06-01,8985227,Lora,the hosts were very responsive to email and text questions and concerns
the neighborhood and location is excellent,,,,,
the apartment is a 4th floor walk up without an elevator which could be an issue for disabled person or someone with lots of luggage,,,,,
it also looks nicer in the photos since the entire building is in poor repair -- the bathroom is tiny with the bathroom sink in the kitchen although this is mentioned in the written description,,,,,
not able to locate the washing machine and dryer,,,,,

3069104,34454255,2015-06-08,18061975,Christine,"We couldn't have asked for a better experience with our hosts (Courtney and Martine). From the first inquiry, to our arrival, Martine was great at communicating everything we needed and checking to make sure we were all set. They also sent us a PDF of local places of interest which was very helpful."

3069104,35949657,2015-06-23,114772,Elizabeth,"Courtney's place was in such a great location in the historic Beacon Hill neighborhood. The apartment is in an older building but hey... this is Boston, that is what you should expect! The place was great for two people and had all the amenities that you would need. Check in and check out was a breeze. I recommend this place for its proximity to great landmarks and restaurants. Do keep in mind that you need to be comfortable walking up three flights of stairs so if you are able to do that, then go here!"
3069104,38136438,2015-07-13,17815592,Isabel,"This apartment was perfect for exploring historic Boston. There was easy access to Boston Commons, the North End, and so many historic sites. The city is incredibly walkable and the hosts included a great guide on how to get in from the airport to the apartment."
My friend and I were in town for a wedding,so very little time was spent inside the apartment,but the accomodations were perfect for getting ready and crashing after a long day.,,,
The apartment itself is a fourth floor walk-up,"so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who would have difficulty with the steep staircases. \"",,,,
3069104,39991806,2015-07-27,1021421,Elizabeth,"My friend and I had a wonderful time staying at Courtney and Martine's! Their place was just as described, if not better - fabulous location, very clean, and not to mention wonderfully decorated; we felt right at home! Martine was also incredibly communicative throughout the entire process, giving suggestions on what to do, where to eat, etc. - he even sent a detailed email about parking in the area when he found out that my friend and I might be renting a car to get out to Foxboro for an event. He really just seemed genuinely concerned that we have the best time in Boston possible, and that really meant so much to us both! We will definitely be checking availability at Courtney and Martine's place before anywhere else when we're next in Boston!"
3069104,42090925,2015-08-10,29830768,Henry,"Martine did a great job connecting with me early and outlining the important details i should know (keys, building, apt, places near by, etc). The apartment was clean, organized and as described in the listing, cozy. My overall experience with the apartment and communications with Courtney/Martine was definitely positive. :)"

It was very cozy, nicely decorated and clean, and the bed was so comfortable. Martine and Courtney made us feel very welcome by giving us great tips about what to see while we were in town, and there was even a welcome note waiting for us when we got there. These personal touches made it feel like we were staying in one of our own friends' places while they were out of town. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a place that's within walking distance of many of Boston's great attractions!"

3069104,61324579,2016-02-02,47171241,Meg,Martine and Courtney were really responsive to questions and made sure that I received all of the great information that they sent (including a great guide of things to do)
The apartment is in a great location close to the North End,Beacon Hill,etc. which is really helpful if you don't have a car. I went with a girlfriend and it was the perfect size for 2 with a large living room and kitchen (by downtown Boston standards of course.) The bed was extremely comfortable as well!,,,
I had an awesome stay!,,,,,

3069104,61400601,2016-02-03,55206213,Briana,Courtney & Martine made me feel very welcome as soon as I walked in with a big welcome sign hand written on the chalkboard. I felt very much at home and comfortable. The neighborhood was amazing and prime location to everything.
3069104,66711263,2016-03-24,13015,Jenn,"Courtney and Martine's Beacon Hill apartment is ideally located to experience all that Boston and Cambridge have to offer...Boston Common, Public Gardens, the Esplanade, Faneuil Hall, the North End, the South End...all walkable from 31 Temple St."
The space works best for 1-2 people,and offers a fully equipped kitchen to cook meals at home while enjoying a glass or two of wine. Despite being in the heart of Suffolk University the apartment was quiet,something that's important for many travelers running on only a few hours of sleep per night :),,,
Hosts Courtney and Martine are very communicative both before and during your stay,and are available in the event you have any questions.,,,,

She was a very clear communicator from the outset so we knew exactly what was expected from us and she was respectful of our privacy whilst being simultaneously friendly and helpful. And then there's her baking. Wow. She bakes frequently and her guests enjoy the fruits of her toils. The breakfast she serves is phenomenal (without a doubt the best breakfast we have had while travelling) with hand-cut fruit, home-made waffles, bagels and granola. Plus she bakes almost nightly so there's always an abundance of tasty treats to snack on."
In short,"an amazing experience that we highly recommend. Thanks Susan!\"",,,,
200265,606924,2011-10-07,1202256,Emma,Susan was a very gracious host who warmly welcomed us into her home. The house was extremely comfortable and Susan went out of her way to accomodate us.

We only stayed there for 2 nights, but we felt like home and enjoyed chatting with Susan.  We especially love her breakfast.  She baked everything fresh every day.  Due to her extensive experience in her career, we were able to learn from her a great deal.  The location of her house is about 3 minutes from the T.  We found it super convenient to travel anywhere and to/from the airport.  The room is spacious and the bathroom is clean.  Her dining room and living room are gorgeous."

Being so close to the red line, Susan's location makes a great base to explore Boston."
200265,1003437,2012-03-15,1812516,Bettina,Susan is a wonderful host. She is very caring and makes you feel at home immediately. There is nothing we would have missed while staying with her. Susan’s nice victorian house is very close to the next subway which takes you downtown in about 10 minutes. We would definitely stay with her again.
200265,1026326,2012-03-20,1918197,Sven,Our stay at Susan's was great. The room was clean and the breakfast she made was probably the best we had on our whole trip.
She is excited in giving you tips what to do in Boston and wants you to have a great stay.,,,,,

200265,1080419,2012-04-03,2013939,Branden,"Our stay with Susan was extremely stress-free. She had no trouble making a great breakfast despite my wife's difficult food allergies. Susan was nice to talk to, and easy to work with. She knew when we wanted some time, and when we wanted to chat. Susan was very energetic and welcoming."
The house itself is very comfortable. Parking was easy,and the T was literally around the block. We popped up to the city for dinner on two of the nights,and were into downtown in no time. There was an excellent book collection available in our room.,,,
Ask Susan for the best way back and forth to the highway. The common route the GPS will give you is always backed up,"but there are better ways available.\"",,,,

Delicious breakfast every morning and comfortable accommodations.  The house is a 3 minute walk to one of the T-stations, making getting around easy and convenient.  We would definitely stay here again on future trips to Boston!"
200265,1364500,2012-05-28,2252247,Valerie,"We loved it!!  The 5 star rating doesn't do this place justice.  The service, room, breakfast, and the desserts were nothing short of amazing (that coffee cake, wow!).  Susan went far and above what she promised during our stay in her beautiful home.

200265,1461535,2012-06-11,2464441,Mike,"Susan is a perfect host. I had never before used AirBnB, and I approached the experience with some trepidation. My stay at Susan's beautiful house was so pleasant that I am become an AirBnB believer!"
The house is a lovely and tastefully done Victorian in adorable part of Dorchester. Locationwise,it's ideal. The walk from the house to the Shamut T stop took about 3 minutes,and from Shamut to anywhere in Boston is an easy ride. My room was spacious,airy,and comfortable. The bathroom and other shared spaces were immaculate.,
Susan herself cooked breakfast on the weekend for me,and she sat and chatted with me while I ate. Chatting with her was one of the highlights of the stay,as she has fantastic stories and an outlook I found refreshing.,,,
I recommend that anyone looking to stay at a BnB in Boston strongly consider Susan's house. It was a pleasure to stay there during my week in Boston,"and I will certainly return next time I'm in town!\"",,,,

This BNB is very clean! I thought sharing a bathroom would perhaps be an issue,it was not at all. The bathroom was clean at all hours of the day!,,,,
Susan's cooking? 5 + stars! Everything was delicious!,,,,,

Would definitely stay here again if back in Boston."

Gracious, convenient, clean, wifi, free parking on the street, 5 minutes to the red line T that is a short trip to South Station, okay, I was prepared for that. But outstanding food? If I hadn't stopped myself, I could have had a gourmet, decadent \"\"continental\"\" breakfast that spoiled my appetite for lunch every single day. This place is not just a home"
It is also where a master creates magic in the kitchen,and calls it a continental breakfast,or hot breakfast available on weekends. Rivaled the best food we ate on the trip,and we ate well.,,

From her bright smile, sweet demeanor, and fantastic cooking.  We also loved the nighttime treats as we came back from a busy day of exploring.  Susan can direct you to many local restaurants/neighborhoods.  She is also very close to public transportation which makes it very easy to get into the city everyday.  We brought our young son and she even made him feel at home.  I will be making this my place of residence anytime we are able to get back to Boston.  Thank you Susan!!!

200265,1820608,2012-07-28,2766421,Thomas,"We were in Boston for only 3 nights, and Susan's place was the perfect place for us. It is within 2 minutes from the T, and from there you can travel easily to anywhere in Boston. Susan was also a gracious host and made sure we had everything we needed and had some great ideas about places to see and eat. She is also quite the cook and every morning we were treated to Susan's home baking, cooked fresh along with an assortment of other breakfast items. The bedroom and bathroom were both spacious and clean, and it really felt like a home away from home. If you want to visit Boston, then we would wholeheartedly recommend Susan's place."
200265,1869427,2012-08-02,2296027,Laurence,Susan's house was a good choice to stay in Boston. Her house is conveniently  located close to the T red line which takes you downtown in about 15 minutes. Susan works very hard to keep her beautiful house immaculate. She asks her guests to be very meticulous too to make everybody's stay comfortable and enjoyable.
Last but not least,she's a great cook! Breakfast is delicious and her pancackes,cakes and cookies are amazing!,,,

200265,2158443,2012-09-01,1831340,Agnès,What a lovely house in an historical neighborhood of Dorchester. I have enjoyed sitting a the breakfast table every morning while watching the squirrels in the trees.  Not putting on weight is a challenge because Suzan's breakfasts are amazing ;-)
I have really enjoyed my room (and did spend a lot of time in it because I had to work a lot,wich makes it worth mentioning that internet was very reliable). The place is very clean and the house is only a few minutes away from the T station,in no time you are in the heart of Boston.,,,

Zum Frühstück wurden abwechslungsreiche Dinge wie Obstteller, Bagels, Toast, selbstgebackener Kuchen und Zuccinibrot, verhschiedene Müslisorten, usw angeboten. Außerdem gab es nach Wunsch Tee oder Kaffee sowie O-Saft."
Das Haus war sehr sauber. Die U-Bahnstation ist nur 2 Gehminuten vom Haus entfernt und man ist in ca. 20 Min im Bostoner Zentrum.,,,,,

200265,4578788,2013-05-13,5864907,Valentín,I had a great time at Susan’s. She is a brilliant and very attentive  hostess that goes out of her way to help guess to settle. feel comfortable and get to know Boston. She even picked me up at the airport and show me around town on our way to the B&B.
The place is super clean and has a lot of character. The room is located on the top floor which is basically just for yourself. It is very roomy and luminous with two windows. Breakfast is superb and complete with homemade cereals,fresh fruit and more often than not Susan would bake you cake. Weekends is delicious freshly cooked breakfast time.,,,,
The house is in a quiet area and convenient location from exploring downtown Boston and other locations along the T red-line (train/subway) route such as Cambridge (MIT and Harvard). The stop is just 3 minutes away and you can be virtually anywhere in town in less than half an hour including any walking.,,,,,

I asked Susan to guide me as to where to go and grab a bite to eat. However, Susan was very thoughtful and she stepped out and brought me dinner. A very kind gesture!!! She communicates well and is willing to go out of her way to make your stay pleasant. Breakfast is an awesome treat but even better is her homemade granola. It is to die for!!!  Susan is highly recommended!"

Upon meeting her I knew staying at her B&B was an excellent choice. Her home is clean, quiet, inviting and provides everything you need for a stay in Boston. Having lived in the city, she knows all of the ins-and-outs and what places are hot and what places are tourist traps. She lives a block away from the Red Line T and within walking distance of all the main veins and arteries to city proper. And to top it all off, every morning Susan greeted me with freshly prepared breakfast ( a starch and fresh fruit) and the breakfast on check-out day was even better.

Susan is also very thoughtful. I am in the process of moving back from abroad and had an excessive amount of luggage.

After comparing a few of the profiles on this website I decided to book a room at Susan's place and in hindsight I can say that I couldn't have been more pleased: a spacious room and cosy communal areas for the guest, the house is but a short stroll from the nearest metro station in a nice residential neighborhood, all sorts of services (post office, dry cleaner) are within walking distance, going into town to sample everything the city has to offer is a piece of cake, and so is coming in from and going back out to the airport via public transportation. Susan was a brilliant host who always had the wellbeing of her guests in mind and helped with valuable tips on things worth doing and seeing. Daily breakfast was a treat, the one on Sunday is something you don't want to miss, her home-made granola is to die for. An added bonus was having two other guests in the house to team up with for a day trip out of town on the weekend. All in all a fabulous time."

The neighborhood is quiet and a little outside the city centre,but it has a train station with good connections to the centre.,,,,
"\"",,,,,
200265,16088836,2014-07-22,6356615,Stacey,Susan is a lovely host. This is basically her private home that she graciously opens up to others for their stay in Boston.  We were very comfortable here. Our accommodations were clean and we had enough space. Susan is very clear about her expectations of guests and you will be very clear about what you can expect from your stay with her.  There is a shared bath with other guests that is always clean and there was never a scheduling conflict with other guests during our 4 night stay there.  It is very important to Susan that her guests have a comfortable stay and enjoy Boston. She is more than willing to offer up suggestions and give guidance when visiting the city.
Continental breakfast was provided each day (my husband absolutely loved her granola!) and a great pancake breakfast on Sunday.,,,,,
The Dorchester neighborhood  appears to be very culturally and economically diverse. It's probably like a lot of city (URL HIDDEN) busy.  Susan's street does quiet down in the later hours of the evening but you will still hear the city noises because the windows are all open (in the warmer weather of course).  If you have lived in the city,this is nothing new.  If you are from the suburbs,it might be a bit noisy.  The T (Boston's subway) is only a 3m walk from Susan's house and it is very easy to navigate.  We found this location to be ideal.  We did not travel around Dorchester much,as we were there mainly to see the Boston sites.  But while we were in Dorchester,we felt safe in our car and walking at all times.,
Susan has a dog that is just a treat.  Zoe is medium sized pup that is very playful and well behaved.  If you like dogs you will love Zoe.  If you're not an animal person...I really don't think she will bother you much.,,,,,
Overall,"our stay with Susan was very pleasant and we found her to be very accommodating.  \"",,,,

Station à moins de 200 mètres.,,,,,
La maison est bien tenue (règles strictes).,,,,,

"Merci pour tout encore.\"",,,,,
200265,22493580,2014-11-08,6394043,Heather,"The location was a few minutes walk from the subway.  It was about a ten minute ride from downtown. Easy access to the city.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The breads she made at breakfast were delicious.  There was also cereal, granola, fruit etc.  the room was up on the second floor and the temperature was easily and quickly adjusted - which was great.  The housecoats provided for the stay were a nice touch. Thank you Susan for a lovely stay."
200265,22670760,2014-11-11,3316619,Razvan,"I travelled to Boston together with my wife an my 7 yers old daughter and we had a wonderful time staying in Susan's house. We loved the authentic style of the house, the impecable cleanliness and of course, Susan's great hospitality. The house is located in a nice area very close to the metro station (direct line to center). If back in Boston we'd love to stay again at Confort in Historic Melville Park 2."
200265,22891621,2014-11-17,21920656,Dan,This was our first airbnb stay.
"Susan sent a short \"\"comfort questionaire\"\" before our arrival asking for things like preferred breakfast time",coffee vs tea,dietary restrictions,etc.  She also sent several short texts before our arrival to check arrival details and welcoming us.,,
When we arrived,our room  was bright,neat and clean as was the rest of Susan's house.  Fresh flowers in our bedroom were a very much appreciated surprise.,,,
"Susan provided a tour of the common areas of the house and explained the house rules.  She is very conscious of the privacy and security of her guests and this is reflected in the house rules and the \"\"high honor system\"\" which guests are expected to follow.  We felt perfectly safe from the moment we arrived; while the two other airbnb rooms each had a guest",there was never even the hint of an issue with privacy - or competition for the bathrooms!,,,,
At the time we were there,Zoe,a Boykin Spaniel,was 10 months old.  Zoe was energetic and engaging and a wonderful puppy.  Susan has no problem putting Zoe in her crate if that is the guest's preference.,,
The location is a very quiet,well kept residential neighborhood,less than two blocks from the Red Line.  Extremely convenient for getting in to and around Boston.  We did not have a car,but off street parking is available.,,
We very much appreciate that Susan's home is smoke free.,,,,,
Most days,breakfast is continental,but a wide variety of options is included including fresh homemade granola and baked goods.  On Sunday,Susan,a former caterer for many years,cooked a sumptuous breakfast: coffee and tea
Tea and cookies were available in the evenings as well.,,,,,
The common areas were filled with books,videos and CDs for the guests use and enjoyment.  The bedroom had a wide selection of books,too.  And Susan is a fount of information about things to do in Boston as well as the best ways to get from point A to B - whether you want the shortest route or a scenic one.,,,
We have stayed in many B&Bs in our travels; but this being our first airbnb experience,"we were still somewhat anxious.  Susan completely relieved our anxiety with her pre-arrival communication and her gracious hosting.  Her home and her hosting are very comfortable and welcoming.  \"",,,,
200265,23551604,2014-12-04,8403301,Riccardo,Susan was the most delightful host. She helped me in all manners and she made may staying very cozy and delightful She is a very considerate and helpful host. Her breakfasts were an excellent way to start the day.

200265,25239736,2015-01-10,24147322,Allison,"Susan is very experienced in hosting guests. She prepared everything in advance, arranged things in details. The B&B has good decorations and was very clean. Thank you for your perfect breakfast. We miss Zoey so much."
200265,26594486,2015-02-16,25122166,Sheree Olivene,"Susan was a great host who went above and beyond to ensure that I was comfortable in her home. Her puppy Zoe is warm, welcoming, and friendly. I was unfortunately caught in the blizzard and and Susan made me breakfast, lunch, and dinner. All three meals were scrumptious. She is also very knowledgable of the Boston and area and gives good tips on getting around the city and attractions to visit."
200265,28151742,2015-03-18,27007664,Joseph,Exceptional.
"I spent 3 nights in Boston at a beautiful b and  b in Melville. I was my first experience of Air bnb and it was truly amazing. Susan is the perfect host. I enjoyed 3 days of real tranquillity and incredible hospitality. The house itself is a beautiful  building full of character but also extremely comfortable. I enjoyed as excellent breakfast each morning. The owner was extremely helpful and assisted with information an many occasions. At the end of my stay I left my scarf behind and she kindly dropped it into Boston to where I was . I could not imagine such an exceptional service in even the best 5 star hotel. I look forward to both  visiting both Boston and using Air  bnb In the future.\"",,,,,
200265,29777853,2015-04-12,8781965,Jaymie,"\"My husband, 15 year old daughter and I had a terrific mini-vacation in Boston, our stay at Susan's airbnb contributing greatly to the whole wonderful experience! Her place is exactly as she describes in her listing except that it can't begin to capture Susan's personal touch of warmth and her dedication to providing her guests extraordinary service and satisfaction! Every question, beginning with my inititial research of airbnbs was answered promptly and thoroughly.  When we arrived, Susan was not available to check us in personally, a 1st for her, but her instructions from where to find the key to directing us to our rooms, to other things to know in general, were crystal clear, warm and inviting. Our entire stay with Susan followed suit - warmth with every detail and need attended to, including providing me with a list of Boston restaurants meeting some pretty specific criteria of ours! Also, Susan keeps her place absolutely spotless, including that she has a small dog, Zoe, who incidentally added quite an unexpected element of fun to our visit, energetically greeting us when we returned \"\"home\"\""
200265,30897769,2015-04-28,31131053,Rachel,"Susan's house is very clean, and very close the red line station (5 mins by walk). Her dog is lovely too and make you happy :). I had nice talks with Susan and she even brought me out on Friday night to a nice tasty restaurant with reasonable price, I enjoyed a lot! She is just too busy, I wish she could have more relaxing time for herself!"
200265,32388854,2015-05-17,5003963,Nigel,Susan seems to be running basicall(URL HIDDEN)so when the 2 or 4 rooms are all occupied the single shared bathroom can be bit of a problem. She is very particular about certain rules that need to be followed which is understandable when so many people are there at the same time. It felt a bit regimental and constraining but she tries to counteract that by providing flowers and small chocolates in the room AND a wonderful breakfast. She was obviously very busy but concerned that as a guest you get the most out of your stay in Boston. After coming from the quiet of theCape I found that it was rather noisy as sounds travelled easily from within as well as from outside the house. The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. I chose Susan as it was only 3 minutes from the Red Line station and stayed 2 nights. She was also very good at communicating before and afterwards!
200265,32692722,2015-05-20,1555922,Janet,"Susan's lovely home was perfect for my needs in Boston--convenient access to the T, an ample breakfast, spotless housekeeping, friendly dog, and a welcoming hostess."
200265,32983237,2015-05-24,30673503,Natalie,"Susan was a great host! She got to know my friends and I, was very gracious and helped us narrow down our plan in Boston for the next day. She is very nice, has a beautiful home, a fun pup and she may even make you a treat, or breakfast!"
200265,33310193,2015-05-26,28374337,Carlos,"The experience at Susan's house was awesome for me and my friends. She made us feel like at home. She is a great host, very helpful and takes care of everything. The neighborhood was safe and clean and it is connected to downtown by the T red line. And the city of Boston, you know, wonderful."
200265,33855062,2015-06-01,1580156,Benjamin,"Very nice place, lot of charm. Good location minute s from public transportation."
Clean and well organized.,,,,,
Susan is a very flexible host on top of being charming.,,,,,
"We will Definitely stay again if in Boston.\"",,,,,
200265,34702505,2015-06-11,30706916,Kandyce,We enjoyed our interactions with Susan and her friendly dog Zoe! Susan was very helpful in suggesting places to go and talking about our experience in Boston throughout our 7 day stay. She offered good hospitality overall.
Our bed was comfortable and she provided several amenities that made our stay easy like breakfast/coffee available every morning,shampoo,conditioner and body wash in the bathroom,and a pitcher of water and chocolates in our room.  I do wish we had more access to use the kitchen for cooking if we opted not to eat out every meal. There was very limited refrigerator space and were only allowed microwave usage.,,
We found the sense of privacy and comfort in the house was a bit wanting. Of course we had our own room to relax,but there were multiple guests and this is Susan's home. Though she is not always home,she was there a lot of our stay and we did not feel completely free to lounge in common areas when we were there. Be prepared that there will be multiple guests staying at the same time,sharing one bathroom upstairs by our rooms with a time limit. This is understandable with a full house but this was not ideal having to limit our bathroom/shower time to 15 minutes. I felt rushed and I just didn't want to feel this way on my vacation.,,
"It was easy to come and go as we pleased as we were provided a key. The house's location near the T station was fantastic! Very easy to get around Boston from here without a vehicle.. although it is a little further out from city center (about 20-40 min train ride depending on where you're at in the city). \"",,,,,
200265,41947080,2015-08-10,34004602,Lily,"My stay was pleasant overall. The description of the accommodation is accurate. I enjoyed the place because it was very close to the subway station and I had my private space. It's a great place if you are looking for a short-term stay with convenient transportation. However, I would hesitate recommending this place to you if you plan on spending more than a week in Boston and hope for an independent stay. I rented the room for about 2 months in the summer time. Some nights were too hot even with plenty of fans. I also didn't feel free moving around the house because there were many rules. However, again, the place the great if you are just staying for a couple of days."
200265,43285999,2015-08-18,33645026,Collin,"This was by far the best Airbnb experience I've ever had. Annoyingly, I delayed my arrival multiple times on Friday, and didn't end up checking in until nearly midnight. Susan was extremely accommodating, and did not seem at all bothered. Once I'd arrived to Susan's place, it became immediately clear that she runs a smooth operation. She gave me a tour of the house, and showed me that every aspect of my stay had been considered and handled by her. Not only was Susan willing to give me a tour of her place in the middle of the night, she was so kind as to ask me how I was doing. We talked for half an hour about our lives, and I was taken aback by how genuine and kind Susan was. After she showed me to my room, Susan told me that she would be out of my way, but that I should feel free to call or text her if I needed anything. The rest of my stay was comparable to staying at a nice bed and breakfast, only with a more personal touch."
200265,43582579,2015-08-20,38442118,Cecilia,"Susan was an extremly well predisposed host. She was expecting our arrival before we got there. She prepared our room for three and suggested what was conviniant for us to do. The breakfast was excellent, healthy and complete: with homemade puddings and cereals, fruit, coffe, orange juice and toasts. The train is just round the corner and it is easy to get boston from there. It is a good alternative to stay outside the city. The neighborhood is calm, although we prefer not to be around at night because it felt lonely."
200265,44475063,2015-08-26,26503322,Heidi,"Susan was an attentive, articulate, personable host.  Her home is an 1860 Victorian and everything was clean and tidy.  There is a train station right around the corner and I found it easy to hop right on and go to Boston Commons to walk the Freedom Trail-I didn't time the ride, but I believe it was around 20 minutes-I took the train 4 times and never had to wait more than 5 minutes at the station.  I needed to travel to the suburbs while I was there, so  had a rental car, but if I were to stay there and only have plans within the city, the train is free from Logan airport, and I could easily have done without a car . Parking was plentiful and easy to find--and free. I am an experienced traveler and have no physical limitations, so my stay at Susan's home was perfect for me and my needs.  If you have any physical limitations, I would make sure to communicate these with Susan prior to arriving to make sure you are comfortable--it is a lovely home, but it is over a hundred years old and the stairs are steep-(Susan is right there when you arrive and was incredibly helpful with our bags when we went to our room); also, there is no air-conditioning; Susan has fans in the windows that help circulate the air, and this was fine for me--it's just good to know if you are not comfortable with that.   There is one shared bathroom among several guest rooms.  I never had to wait for my morning shower or felt rushed, but I did try to be mindful of other guests, so didn't linger in there--just got my rituals done quickly and made my exit. The neighborhood is urban, but quiet.  I felt safe during the day when walking to and from the train station."
200265,46183701,2015-09-08,37394679,Rose,Susan was an excellent host - she even met me at the station when I arrived late and made incredible homemade breakfasts. She was welcoming and her home is beautiful in a great location.
200265,46643901,2015-09-12,3382877,Matt,"I enjoyed my stay with Susan, she's a true professional."
Her place is clean and comfortable,but can be a little hot because there's no A/C (only fans).,,,,
There's a good chance you'll be sharing her place with another guest,but there's plenty of space and you will have your own room.,,,,
She does provide a variety of breakfast options for you while most hosts don't provide one.,,,,,
Her place is close to public transportation and about 15-25 minutes from Boston's Convention Center.,,,,,
Overall,"her place is an affordable option and I would stay here again in the future.\"",,,,
200265,46953639,2015-09-14,42729285,Eugene,Susan is a very attentive host and really cares about every detail thats humanly possible. The listing is accurate. I'll recommend anyone to pay a visit.

The breakfast was very good with selfmade cereals, bananabread and fresh fruits at the weekend. Susan was a good host. She is nice and helpful  and had good tipps for our stay in Boston.

Her home is a beautiful and quaint old house but everything is maintained well and the bathroom is nice and clean. She provided plenty of bed linens, towels, and a clothes rack in the room. The location is the best part, as it is just a block or two from a stop on the red line and there are restaurants and shops within walking distance."

Susan serves her guests a very nice breakfast with different types of bread,fruit,granola. Here cakes and cookies are amazing.,,,
When you need a word of advice,she's there to help you.,,,,
Linnen is changed as much as needed,and you can always ask Susan if you need anything else.,,,,
Other guests sometimes wrote that here houserules are quite strickt. To us,everything she said was obvious... We wouldn't have done it any other way... After all,you're staying in someone's home and you are on your best behaviour... That's logical,right?,,
Zoë,Susans dog,is a very cheerful and happy dog. She's very well-behaved,so if you're not that into dogs,that's a plus too.,
She loves here belly rubs though :-).,,,,,

200265,92924737,2016-08-10,71004597,Carol,"Susan was very friendly and accommodating.  Her organization and preparation for our stay was impressive.  We stayed on the top floor and had lots of privacy even though other guests were staying on other floors.  This was a great launching point for our daughter's college tours in Boston, which kept us very busy during the day so it was great to return to a home in the evening that was welcoming and comfortable.  Although we did not eat breakfast due to our very rigorous college tours schedule, it was available to us each morning without fail.  Zoey, Susan's dog, is as cute and well behaved as previous reviewers described.  This was our first Air B&B experience and I would definitely do it again.  It was also our first time in Boston and I look forward to returning to the area...perhaps to visit our daughter in college in a few years?!"

She was very responsive to our needs and very knowledgeable of local attractions and resources.  We walked the neighborhood day and night as our son lives with his family very near by and we always felt safe.  There was always a special treat for breakfast.  Susan solicited, genuinely appreciated, and responded to the feedback we gave her during our stay.  We would very much like to stay with her again."

Fanuiel Hall Marketplace was where I went for yummy food and shopping EVERY night! Such fun! Thanks for rocking me to sleep every night!
2633478,14891144,2014-06-28,17056849,Tara,"We had a wonderful time on the Taurus!  You can't beat the location.  We walked everywhere (except when we needed to cross waterways)!  The kids especially loved the novelty of staying on a boat.  They met some lovely children who were staying on a boat next to ours.  It was very nice.  We often stay with friends when we travel to save on expenses and, more importantly, spend time together, so we're not accustomed to city hotel costs.  We first found the boat as a more affordable way to stay in the city.  Once you add in the cleaning fees, airbnb fees, etc., the cost was rather high, especially when you don't get luxuries, like daily room cleaning or the availability of room service, you have to take out the trash yourself, and you need to deal with some unpleasant things, like sewer smells.  We never would do this for a long trip.  But for 2 nights, we made special memories, and we are very glad we did this.  John was friendly and available.  We had a great time!"

2633478,18890985,2014-09-02,18860384,Sarah,"\"We really enjoyed our stay on the Taurus. Its location near the end of the jetty made for a beautiful view of the harbour. The children loved being on a boat and sleeping \"\"below decks\"\"; it was a unique holiday.\""
2633478,21064896,2014-10-10,22203804,Bill,Absolutely recommend using SleepAfloat.  Never slept or been on a houseboat before.  Was a great break from staying at hotels and enjoyed the ocean breeze.
"The only thing that takes getting used to is the gentle rocking of the boat.  But that goes along with being on a houseboat.   I am complete land lover and quickly got used to the rocking. \"",,,,,
2633478,21851745,2014-10-25,372326,Sandro And BB,"The house boat is very cozy and in a great part of town. It was in need of a little ordering or tidying up when we arrived, just little things, like it needed a mothers touch so to speak, but apart from that it was clean. Make sure you check for the weather as we had a bad weather with strong winds and the boat really rocked."
2633478,32493691,2015-05-19,1717561,Gina,Our houseboat experience with SleepAfloat was wonderful!  The accommodations were comfortable and the location could not be beat!  We especially enjoyed connecting with houseboat neighbors and meeting people!
2633478,38369695,2015-07-15,27443340,Ruth,We had a great time on the Taurus!   Absolutely perfect location in the North End - we walked to tons of restaurants (in less than 10 minutes) and historic areas in Boston; we even walked to Fenway (about an hour)!   The boat is comfortable and clean and very easy to access.   The full sized fridge is great - we saved money by shopping and cooking on the boat.  It was a great week.  Nothing better than relaxing on the deck with a cool one and watching the boats come in and out of the harbor.   The host was very communicative and even though we didn't need them (because we didn't have any problems!) I felt like we were very well taken care of .
2633478,48326315,2015-09-25,15881861,Greg,"Great location right on the water.  My coworker and I shared the houseboat for two nights and it was in perfect walking distance to the Financial District, where we work.  The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom with full shower worked out great.  We didn't end up utilizing the kitchen at all during our stay, but it looked fully functional and nice."

7693354,43458591,2015-08-19,117226,Karen,Cliff was a fantastic host and quite the impressive chef! Be sure to ask for the Sunday Breakfast! It was so nice to have breakfast included in our stay!
The Victorian house was easy to find,parking was convenient,the third floor room is a good size with a very comfortable mattress and fluffy pillows.,,,
There are plenty of bath towels and lovely handmade organic soaps in the bathroom.,,,,,
We rented a car but would definitely skip that next time for use of public transit which is easy to access to and from the house!,,,,,
We enjoyed our short stay and recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy the city,the beach,"and a friendly home away from home!\"",,,

Cada mañana nos preparó el desayuno y compartimos conversaciones interesantes con él.,,,,,
La habitación es grande,limpia y muy agradable.,,,,
La ubicación muy buena,solo a 3 minutos andando del metro.,,,,

7693354,44872803,2015-08-29,22150305,Louis-Philippe,"Liza n'était pas présente lors de notre visite, mais son marie a pris soin de nous accueillir de la façon la plus cordiale! Il nous a fait faire un bref tour de la maison, nous a fait rencontré ses deux enfants et était prêt à répondre à tous nos questions. La maison était très propre et le quartier très calme et sécuritaire. Le stationnement est très accessible dans la rue. Au matin il nous a servi un très bon petit déjeuner."
7693354,45642079,2015-09-04,4659830,Brad,A really wonderful Victorian home and family. Loved the room on third floor and loved the fact that it was air conditioned. Host was very welcoming and I enjoyed our conversation. Picturesque old-timey neighborhood. I'd highly recommend it.
7693354,45720720,2015-09-05,42323353,Tobias,The family was nice and helpful. House was in a safe area(school is around the corner and there was always the police).metro station 5min away.
7693354,46199316,2015-09-08,22459965,Julien,"Liza and her family were very nice with us. We really liked the room and the house. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. The house is close to the subway. The breakfasts were good: we could try different meals every morning. They also helped us during our stay (visits, advice, things to do). I recommend this place."
7693354,46415302,2015-09-10,42185953,Áine,"Great location, very close to the train and a nice area. Breakfast was a lovely touch. Hosts were very accommodating, thanks for a pleasant experience."
7693354,46527918,2015-09-11,10221734,Winton,"Liza could nor have been nicer. The room and house are lovely and are only 30 min from Logan using the subway.  They served us breakfast even though we woke up early to catch our flight, and had many recommendations for restaurants in the area."
"Great place to stay if you are in transit through Logan.\"",,,,,
7693354,46781777,2015-09-13,33180981,Maximilian,"Liza and her husband were amazing hosts. We stayed there for two nights. Liza welcomed us and gave us a tour of their really beautiful victorian style house. We liked the stay in the very spacious wonderful room with a comfy bed. Everything was very clean and shower gel etc was provided. Cliff, her husband made us really good breakfast in the morning with different food to try every day. They would also give us useful recommendations for sightseeing in Boston. As it rained one day they even lent us an umbrella, because we didn't bring one. Even though we arrived late at about 10 pm Liza stayed up to greet us. We could park our car next to the house and it felt like a safe and quiet neighbourhood. Also the walk to the tube station was short, about 3-5 minutes. The train takes about 15 min to Boston common. We definitely recommend to stay with Liza and Cliff! It was an amazing AirBnB experience and we would stay there again!"
7693354,46962459,2015-09-14,42994421,Maeve,"Liza wasn't there when my best friend and I stayed over, but she was very helpful to me in the time before our trip, and both her and her husband were very welcoming and accommodating! Everything in the house was totally clean, the neighborhood was peaceful, the walk from the train station was very short, the bed was super comfortable, and everyone was very friendly! This was my first time traveling by myself, and Liza and Cliff made it such a positive and fun experience. Cliff made us waffles in the morning, and helped us find places to go after we checked out. There's honestly nothing I could've asked for more of, and I highly recommend this listing for anyone visiting Boston!"
7693354,47125340,2015-09-15,40435632,Philipp,"Lizas husband was at home to let us in the house. We could leave the car in front of the house and took the public transportation (1 block, less than 5 min walk!) to the city."
