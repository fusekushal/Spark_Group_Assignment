At the moment I'm working on a PhD at MIT and am hoping to do something with my career that will help business and NGOs in developing countries operate more effectively. I love travelling to Latin America and have tried to go during the winter holidays to explore and study Spanish for the past few years. I've also spent time volunteering in Kenya through a non-profit that I was heavily involved with during college. Although I study engineering, my real interest is reducing poverty - I am passionate about social justice and this affects most things I do.",,,,false,,,,,,,,,,,,
